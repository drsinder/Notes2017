I knew I was forgetting  something yesterday in our
flurry of exchanges:  It is necessary to return elapsed
time and probably file length information, following a
record operation.  It'd be nice if one could query the
device  while it's operating, too, but that is not so
important as being able to keep records based on actual
data from the device rather than guessing what it's been
doing (as was the case with the old EIS box).

There are a couple of problems with recording using the
audio.  The drill which has been in use as a demo permits
the student to record his own voice, listen to it, and
compare it to the teacher's.  The problem is, every time
he does that on the pc, it creates a new file, and it
is very hard to delete old copies via the -local- command,
i.e., it would  take forever if it could be made to work.
I think there's a problem in the AVC version of the L1PP,
because every time control comes back to Novanet from 
DOS, it kicks me out of the lesson (not EVERY time, but 
usually).  As an aside, it seems like keys pressed between
issuing an "exit" from an ALT Z out to DOS and recovery of
the Novanet display are turned into
stop1's (this may be true for ordinary L1PPs too).

A one-shot test just now revealed no kicking-out because
of keys pressed before the last  (and quite delayed) BEEP from
the hard drive while things were being recovered after "exit".

Flow control was turned on, and turning it off seems to
fix the problem with return from ALT Z shellout.  It 
didn't help the problem after executing the -local-
command to delete old recorded files.

Near panic!  I was in text mode, editing a long, multi-line
-write-.  I pressed lab1 to insert a line, so the -write-
below that line was erased and replotted one line down.  Ok
so far, except that I had it at the wrong location; so I
pressed help1 to delete the new (blank) line.  It erased
all the lower text again, but it didn't replot it!  I
pressed back1 to get out of text mode, but it still did
not display the erased text.  I then pressed n to replot
the screen, and the missing text was plotted.  So nothing
appears now to be lost, but there's a display bug in the
delete line routine.

File with the bug in movemem "xnoteprt99" in drsa
 
the bug is in block 3-b, unit page, line about 35
There is a transfr command there now and the movemem
that is bad is "*" out on the line above.  If I use
the movemem then all I get moved in is blanks and if
the transfr is used everything is fine.  I am moving
from local variables, but I do that all over in the
lesson.

Just had a little experience with estimating that I 
thought you might find interesting.  Scott asked me
how long it would take to write the code necessary to
scan the system for linked notes files.  From memory
I recalled that I scanned the system for damaged namesets
and I suspected I could modify that code, so I said
estimate 1=less than 1 day.
Then I actually went and looked at the code and realized
that it was going to be easy, so I sent my second estimate,
less than 1/2 a day.
Then I looked a bit more, and decided I could get the job
done before I went home, so my third estimate was 2 hours.
Then I did the job, and it took only 1/2 hour.

What is the nature of the interface between Internet/FTP
and KTH/UMC?  Is this something requiring hardware/software
which is unique to CDC PLATO style installations?
++++
The link between KTH and UMUC is requiring the following
 
HARDWARE: cdcnet with connection to internet
 
SOFTWARE: tcp/ip with ftp for nos
 
Both are standard products but not delivered with the
CDC/PLATO software. The software on the PLATO side is
integrated with the s0rhp (delivered with PLATO) which
is a utility using the "mflink" to connect and transfer
files via X25. In this case the traffic is routed thru
internet/ftp instead, and for the KTH-HAWAII link it is
routed thru bitnet/internet.

ooooooooooooooooo
Hi Sam, sorry for being late in responding. I'm not
at all well, feel depressed, and overwhelmed with
problems. The link has also been slow.
 
I use stig_bjorklund-p@plato.kth.se most of the time.
My old adresses should still work, although I fear
I haven't logged on much to other systems lately.
They are more useful for certain things, e.g. a
continued discussion between several people. We
haven't had the time and money to make a more
complete email implementation.
 
I think you have used stigb@com.qz.se (or kom.qz.se).
There are a number of synonymous addresses in case you 
don't recognize it. -- Stig

Hi!
I was interested in getting started on the price/performance
comparison between the Zephyr and the new fast IBM machine.
You gave the documentation to Jenny, but she is on vacation,
and I dont see the information on the top of her desk.  
Could you get another copy of the documentation to me?
 
I would also be interested in any other stuff you might have
used in making your estimates: number of machines needed,
memory requirements, disk requirements per machine and/or
networked disk requirements, cost of hardware and 
peripherals, cost of operating system and libraries,
benchmarks of operating systems and libraries, hardware
and software maintenance costs, or any sort of poop like
that which you might have...
 
Thanks!  Lip

Lippold came into the office today, looking for a manual
on the IBM machine you mentioned on Wednesday (RS6000?).
I couldn't help him with that, but it became evident that
he was rather upset with you because he disagrees strongly
with your ideas about replacing the Zephers with a bunch of
RS6000 machines.  I really was not familiar enough with 
either machine that I could say much, but it was obvious 
that you have offended him by not consulting with a wider
audience about the price performance ratio of the Zepher
machines vs. the RS6000.  I suggested that he should come
talk to you, but he didn't seem to responsive.  Maybe you
should try to talk to him.  He tried to give me some
handwaving arguments to show that you were wrong, but I
really didn't understand what he was saying.

Ok!  I look forward to seeing the info!
 
One big problem in comparing machine performance
is that the environment makes such a big difference.  Basic
stuff like "do we run on top of Unix, or do we write another
limited/efficient operating system in assembly language"; 
"do we make another Tutor-like setup or use standard 
languages or a new language with less limitations than 
Tutor"; etc; can make many orders of magnitude 
performance difference.  Those are hard decisions to 
make, because they have such a strong impact on whether
there is real portability of programs from other systems,
how much work it takes us to implement our stuff, etc.
 
If we are implicitly assuming that we will use more off-the-
shelf operating system & library stuff, then we need to
figure that into the performance measures.

By the way, as I and people in my group look at this stuff,
I will keep in touch.  Even if I have disagreements with how
the cost/performance of the IBM compares to the current 
setup (software and hardware) with the Zephyr, I have very
much interest in making a more standard machine available
as a central computer, in addition to the Zephyrs; I would
love to see a good interface between the two, so that people
could use both____ in instruction, much like they should be able
to run local microcomputer programs as part of a CROUTER (or
some-router) curriculum.  Compared to the other problems 
involved, having this sort of ability shouldnt be impossibly
difficult -- and it would make for a smooth transition 
to other machines from the existing setup.
 
And, as I have said before, I think at least half of CERL's
effort should go into the current setup: we still have a lot
to learn from it, and a lot to develop and offer.  It will 
help us keep our feet on the ground in new designs, too.

I agree with all you say.  I have heard noone suggest doing
away with current courseware delivery.  Future systems must
be able to concurrently deliver both "old" and "new" CW.
 
By the way.  Just as you feel a particular interest and
possession of skills and talents for the computer archieture
analysis, I'm sure the system staff feel similarly
concerning system software for the production and
delivery of CBE materials.  We are quite fortunate to
have both the HW and SW expertise we need on staff.

Hi
 
We have been selling your disk to students for over a year.
It is a wonderful program.  But many students cannot
fathom all those features and it would be nice if there
was a primary version of editor that suppressed the
non-essential featurs, showing only those that are
needed to signin...with an option to go to an index
of higher level features...It would be nice if we could
market just a simple access program with none of the
special features for a little less money ( maybe no
update support )...what do you think?

Ned,
 
I have a request from Shawn Lamaster in AZ for a copy of 
the source for the Microsoft Windows terminal program I
have been working on.  This program will form the basis
of our "next generation" of terminal programs for the
IBM PC and clones.  I told Shawn that I could not approve
such a request but would bring it to your attention.
I do not have any great concern about allowing Shawn to
have a copy of the code and suggest the following guidelines
for such an arrangment:
 
1.  Shawn would have to sign a non-disclosure agreement.
2.  We (I) would not provide any significant consulting
    time in support of Shawn's use/exploration of the PAD.
3.  Shawn would agree to share with us any enhancements or
    bug fixes that he makes.

I can send test software (the current test version
of the L1PP) if you like.
 
PS:  I do not have access to a site that I can test it on.
If testing needs to be done there are a couple of options
that the organization interested in having the test done
can persue:
 
1.  We can send a copy of the SW to the site at which
    the test can be conducted.
2.  We can visit the site with the software and test it
    for you.  I presume that there would be a charge for 
    this; I'd have to check it out with our business office.
3.  You can the the hardware and software to be tested to

    Again, I presume we would have to charge for this.

I would also raise the issue of distribution, unless that
clearly falls under the non-disclosure section.  I think we
do not want him giving away even binaries of a derivative
program without our knowlege/approval, except perhaps for
use in his UA lab.

Ned,
 
 
1.  Shawn would have to sign a non-disclosure agreement.
2.  We (I) would not provide any significant consulting
    time in support of Shawn's use/exploration of the PAD.
3.  Shawn would agree to share with us any enhancements or
    bug fixes that he makes.

I think this was discussed some time ago, but nothing has
been done about it.  In using the new nameset based 
account files I have to keep switching around between
sysfile attachs and regular attaches when I want to access
block 0 of the file.  What I need is a new command that
will allow me to read block 0 of a file the is -attach-ed
(or maybe a system only form of the datain and dataout
commands).  This sounds like something you might want in
the new notes stuff also.   
 
This sounds like something we should get from Walker's
group, and it doesn't seem like a big job.  Maybe Blomme
could do it.  Any hope?

Ongoing stuff:  The guy from Princeton was mostly confused.
He was acting as a go-between for another user there who
has a copy of the L1PP (which version he didn't know), but
somehow thought that they could just use TELNET to talk to
us without making a phone call.  Once their network guy
understood that special terminal emulation software was
needed, and that the software included a TCP/IP interface,
he concluded they could figure it out on their own.  I
asked him to call if it turns out he has an old version.
 
I've asked Jim Riggs to arrange a time with you to learn
how to do the upload stuff.  If it turns out to be at a time
when I'm not in a meeting, I'll be there too -- otherwise
he'll show me later on.

This is a formal request for a "real" terminal -- be it

I already have the port for it, I just need the terminal.

Hi Garrie.
 
Kurt tells me that this would speed his work considerably.
Up to now he has done the project by loading a PPT program
into a CIU PPT.  He has not yet made ROM changes.  He tells
that the old ROMS are no longer made and that they take 
about 30 min. to erase.  In addition, it's a bigger hassle
to program a bunch of the smaller ROMS than fewer of the
larger ones.  He says that he would need this only for the
PPT he is working on and not the "production" models.
As he moves now to making this entirely ROM resident
hassles with ROM reprogramming could slow this up 
considerably.  Could you look into what it would take to
make this mod for one PPT?  (Don't spend a lot of time
looking into this.  It's not worth that.)

Jim,
 
I made an appointment to see you on Friday at 10 AM.  It
may very well be that we can get it all done in pnotes.
Here's my agenda:
 
1.  Staff salary actions.  It's very near the end of the
    contract year now and as far as I know no CERL people
    have yet to learn what they will be paid next year.
    Yet I am told that staff in at least one other 
    department have be informed on this point.  Do you
    know when this information will be available to CERL
    Staff?  Related to this, I made recommendations to
    Mike Walker at your request concerning "preliminary"
    raise recommendations (0, <3, 3, 3+) for budget planning
    purposes.  I understand that those were used by you and
    Mike (over the phone to France) to come up with the
    "final" salary actions.  Mike and I have discussed those
    since his return.  I would appreciate it if salaries of
    those CERL staff in the System Applications group could

    near finding a way to move Scott from his current
    non-ac position to an acedemic position with very few
    "formalities".  Can you update me on that?
 
3.  Scott mentioned to me that his scheduled "anniversary"
    non-ac raise had been delayed for some reason and was
    again "due" about now.  I was unaware of any of this.
    Can you fill me in?
 
4.  I have forgotten whether or not you told me of a
    resolution to the ATT small charge for L1PP touch
    panel support.  Last I can recall it was very high
    on your priorities list.

Jan Moorman just called me.  She said she was going to

expect a call from you.  But, Jan isn't sure how often

transparent fashion, but haven't written the actual con-

I think this whole business of Pence forcing Johnson to
remove a royalty bearing lesson from the system is very
unfair.  To single out an individual for special treatment
strikes me as extremely unjust.  Further, it leaves me
wondering just what the policy is that allows this sort of
action.  I can think of some, but none of the make much
sense.
 a.  /s people may not earn royalties?
 b.  cerl employees cannot earn royalties?  tell that to cca
 c.  games? cannot earn royalties.
 
I suggested to Scott that he sell his lesson to some person
not connected with the system (his wife?).
 
I hope you take some opportunity to express to Pence the
general feeling that I think we all have that his actions
are completely unjustified and discrimatory, and that the
idea that he gets to decide what is worthwhile and what is
not is elitest to say the least.

Well who makes the decision that a lesson is inappropriate
for the catalog?  Why is avatar appropriate but game 
inappropriate?  It seems to me that the user community has
made the decision that game is appropriate, just by the
fact that the lesson is getting use.
 
This whole business of having decisions made in a completely
arbitrary fashion by arbitrary individuals, with no written
guidelines really bothers me.

With respect to your anouncement in pbnotes about the PADs.
I have some further information about service that we will
have available for faculty.
At the Advisory Committee we had been talking about having
one of David Frye's operators install the L1PP for faculty
who might want such service.  ..David volunteered to make
such assignments from among his staff.
Could we chat for a minute or two?

Dale, I was just informed that tomorrow morning at 8:30am
our Information Managment Committee will meet with 
Dean Valli(our new college dean) to talk about our network
problems.  Arthur Baskin is just returned from Europe and
will hopefully be at the meeting as well.
Anyhow, I have a question about networks and NovaNET for 
you, the answer, if you consent, will be relayed to the
members at the meeting tomorrow.
The question is:
In order to connect NovaNET service to the college, and
at the same time have the NovaNET "terminals"(PS/2's and 
some Mac II's) able to access a set of digitized pictures
located on a central storage device (i.e. another network),
which network would the engineers/software mavens at CERL
recommend to the College of Vet Med for
1) earliest connect time and beneficial usage
2) long-term compatibility and usefulness to the College.
 
I hope this is not asking too much of you this am, we can
use all the wisdom available at this point in time.

Dale:  Scott is presently a nonacademic employee.  We do not
take any action to change nonacademic salaries at budget
time.  It happens automatically for the market movement
portion. However, it is Scott's appointment that we are
converting to an academic professional.  When I have
received the approval of the campus affirmative action
office to proceed we will put through his new papers, and at
that time I will need Mike and you to recommend a salary.
By the way Scott will need to get three letters of
reference, prepare a vita and fill in a personal history
questionnaire.  He can be doing all of that while we wait on
the campus approval.

not.  I understand that this is on your list of things to
get done.  Please do give me an opportunity to see the
numbers before they are sent to Scott.
Thanks.

Dale,
        Thanks. I don't really have a document like that,
plus it is probably better if it comes from your end, that
way it can say exactly what you wish.  I can wait for a
while. We just now received the SDK, so I have to install
it and the such.
        Are you using the new Microsoft 6.0? How do you
like the PWB? I already have discovered a bug in our library
that just started showing up because of the way the compiler
was optimizing the code. It was a stupid mistake, but when
you get down into the assembler language, you can see the
differences in the optimizations with Codeview. I was
amazed at how much better 6.0 was.
        Anyway, I will await the release form (or whatever
it is) and the code, and the compiled L0pp for Windows 3.0?
Is that all possible?
        Thanks again.

Mike,
 
I remain concerned about the failure of the security
committee to respond adequately to a couple of issues
which have been before the committee in excess of 1/2
year.  In fact I believe the committee to be neglecting
its responsibilites in theses cases.  I have attempted
to prompt action by the committee a number of times in
our notesfile and by direct communication with you as the
chair of the committee.  These courses of action having
proven ineffective, good conscience dictates attempting
another approach.  I will summarize my intentions:
 
1.  Communicate this message to you.
2.  If 1 proves ineffective, communicate a similar
    message to the rest of the committee.
3.  If 1 and 2 prove ineffective, formally request that
    the Director relieve me of further duty on this 
    committee and give the reasons for the request.

you're gone the terminal when only accept shift-stop, or

up the standard term arrow (i.e. >) and will accept any key-

The only other way to use the machine is to be logged off.
     One option would be for the term arrow to stay on the

Hello Dale,
 
Bill Bright of Detroit Edison gave me your name as the 
Novanet PC expert.  I am having some problems and I have 
questions for you about PCs.
 
1) Is it possible to load the Novanet.com on to a Novell
   File server and run the application on a LAN?
 
2)  When I dial in with my IBM PC, on one RLAU I need to
  wait until the terminal times out and resets before I
can enter a SHIFT-STOP command.  If I try to SHIFT-
STOP before it resets, the system neglects the command.
 
3) Is it possible to avoid the first menu when using a
  PC to connect to NOVANET?  We would like to force the
  user to menu option A but still allow an ALT-Q to 
go back to the menu.
 
4) Do you know of any problems with using IBM PC clones

I would like to get a copy of the TCP/IP L1PP which can
coexist with Novell Netware TSRs.  (The two are now working
in my 108 Altgeld lab separately, but when I tried to load
Plato with Netware already loaded, the computer hung, just
as mentioned in the "novapad" notestring "Novell&TCP".)
 
I can come to ERL to get this 'most any time this week.
Thanks!
 
                        Larry Dornhoff

Steering Committee Members:
 
Mike Smith of UCI and several CERL people have proposed a
"regularized" set of meetings between certain people of the
two organizations.  Ned has formally proposed this to Sid
and, in anticipation of Sid agreeing with the proposal, I
have worked with Mike Smith to set a time and date, as
follows:
 
        Date:  October 18, 1990 (Thursday)
        Time:  10:00 - 2:00
        Place:  CERL conference room 266
 
The participants for this first meeting are to be the CERL
Steering Committee members plus Mike Smith and perhaps
others from UCI.  The cast of participants may change from
meeting to meeting, dependent upon the subject(s) to be
discussed.
                        (cont'd)

Re a non-disclosure agreement for the L1PP, Tina tells me
that sort of thing has been prepared from time to time by
Sharon Tipsword in the OVCR, and that she would presumably
be the right person to do this one.  As our official
liason, Harriot Weatherford might be the best first contact
at OVCR, though.

Early last week!  But really, the amount of code I would 
have to write to get around the problem would not be that
great.  I need only two small units, one to read the block
and one to write it.  There would be small windows where
someone else could grab the file, but that is not a problem
during testing, so I don't need it for months.

whether we have kludge something up or wait for Chris
to do the "attach/records" changes.

I also have some concerns about the details of my
employment which I would like to discuss with you at
your earliest convenience.  To summarize, I have an 
increasing level of discontent with the current organization
of the Lab and the functioning of that organization.
More specifically, about a year ago I agreed to accept
the responsibilities of manager of the system applications
section with explict mention of my reservations concerning
my reporting to Mike Walker rather than to the Director.
 
While the arrangment has worked better than I expected
in some situations it has not worked well in others.
I have some specific concerns many of which I have
already discussed with Mike in some detail; others which
are in detail more recent and not yet discussed with 
Mike, but in general representative of my over all
discontent.  I feel that the time has come for me to
express these concerns to you directly.

Hi,
 
I've got the poop list for things that need to be done
for IBM L1PP 1.60.  It's pretty short.  Drop by and we
can talk about it.  If your interested I'll just have 
you prepare the release.  I'm pretty deep in other shit
right now.
 
Congrats on getting back into the U.  Just remember that
the sheepskin should stay your top priority.
 
Also, thanks for the cooperation you've displayed in
working inside the "new" CERL.  Also for being so helpful
and productive.  It helps me a lot right now!

Thanks for helping me on the phone today.
I will send in for the TCP/IP updated version..
Meanwhile, It occured to me that you might want a Beta
test site that experienced the lockup running 1.50b
with the network bios loaded.  
 
I like to play with new software..
 
I am a CSC graduate student with a good understanding of

It is my understanding from talking with Dave M-M that
the metawindows stuff he received from you is test 
material.  Before I begin our distribution, I need
a copy of the L1PP that includes the metawindows stuff
so that I am making copies from the official version.
Can that be downloaded?
Thanks.

*believe* they have successfully run the L1PP on their
ATT PCs, but don't know for sure if they've run it

but yes, Dale, there is hardware and software available
to affirmatively answer all of your questions.

All members of the Task Force should have received a copy
of the final form of our report last week (I put them in
your CERL mailbox).  Inasmuch as I have heard no response,
I assume that all are willing that this version be declared
the final one.  If so, our next (and last step) is to
prepare a prioritized list of steps required to implement
a capability for coordinated distributed/centralized
processing.  This list would then be passed on to another
committee or committees for implementation.

Status report:
OS2 boots, and DOS boots.
The AVC manual, from what I could understand of it,
requires things called hdiload.dll, hdiload for os2/dos
to use 8514. I could not find such files anywhere, and
so the config/autoexec files aren't all that might be
wanted.
Also, it seems to imply that to use avc under dos you
need a qemm manager of a kind that ibm does not supply.
When run under dos, it says "not enough lim memory".
It runs under os2, but I dont have any idea how to see
the captured files we made from autocad to see if it
does what Helen wants..

At the 3 PM meeting Wed. in room 266 the primary item on 
the agenda will be to review the status of all portions of
the notes project.  Please come prepared to discuss in 
detail the status of all portions of the project for which
you are doing work.  We are about 1 month from the planned
completion date.  At this point we must be certain that
we have identified all items requiring more work.
It is much more important to me that I understand exactly
what the status of all items are than that those items
be on schedule.  Things that are off schedule can be
addressed without serious adverse effect on the project
or on anyone involved with the project.  But items that

cause serious problems.  It's my responsibility to find
solutions to any shortcommings we may have with respect to
schedule.

I spoke with Ned this morning about his odd statement that
he had received no alternative suggestions to using the
4th floor elevator anteroom for a smoking lounge.  He told
me that he does not read erlnotes, and that he was unaware
of the notesfile sequencer.  His excuse was that he has a
hard time keeping up with his pnotes, and certainly does
not have enough time to read a bunch of gnotes files.  I
let it go at that, but maybe someone should clue him in that
keeping up with erlnotes takes about 5 minutes/day, and
at the very least he should sequence erlnotes and pbnotes.

Dale:  I don't see why we should not quote him.  That is, I
can't see how converting PPT's to run ASCII can do any harm
to us on some other front and it would certainly help some
of the older clientele.  However, to do so we are going to
have to figure out what price to quote, which will include
parts and time and to figure out how to allocate the
development time.  Can you and/or Kurt give Bill S. some
data on this and let us get our heads together? How long to
get the "raw" data together on costs?

Jim Pence, Dale Sinder, Kurt Mahan;
 
        Our "inventory for resale" included 44 PPTs at a
total, net, historical cost of $18,685.82, which is $424.68
apiece.  Marked up by 25%, that's $530.85 each.
        If we were to price PPTs the same as ISTs and ASTs,
that'd be $625 each, a difference of $94.
 
        So if the cost of converting a PPT to ASCII were
$75, marking that up by 25% would give $94, and PPTs would
be priced at $625.
        However, I don't know whether $75 is in the right
ballpark--I don't know what's involved in converting the
PPTs to ASCII.

When accounts creates a gnotes file it has to estimate the
number of blocks needed for the directory.  The following
formula is used:
*       
*       
        dbest=(.7*8*1)+(.3*8*3) $$ estimate dblocks needed
*       
*       in the above define --
*       .7 = approx. fraction of notes which are responses
*       .3 = approx. fraction of notes which are base notes
*       8 = approx. number of notes per disk block
*       1 = directory words used per response
*       3 = directory words used per note
 
 
Is this going to change with the new notes system, and if
so, how?

Here is the list of IBM L1PP things needs for 1.60:
 
1.  Manual revisions -- d little / pso.
        I'll get the two of you together and pointed in
        a direction then turn over the techie stuff to you.
 
2.  Evaluate value of RTlink.  It can be returned if not
        of use.  Consider combining RS232 and TCP version
        into same exe file using RTlink overlaying
        capabilites.
 
3.  Visit GRM to try to locate and fix his -xfer- 
        downloading problems over the campus net.
        jdh has some ideas on this.
 
4.  Look into what might be done to relieve the 
        fragmentation of mem when -image- is used many
        times.  D. Kane reports that same image saved
        and deleted over and over eventually returns
        the not enough mem zreturn.  I assume mem frag.

Ned,
 
I have not been able to find a reference to the Zenith
#1599 that Todd Hoffman refered to.  It must indeed be a
very new machine.  I left a message for Todd and he returned
my call while I was at lunch.  He left a message saying that
he would call again soon.
 
From the information in your notes I do have a very good
profile of the machine.  At this point I lack only 2 pieces
of information on the machine that I would like to have.
The first is whether or not there is a communications port
built in other than one required for the mouse.  If there
is not we would need one at some additional cost per 
machine.  However, most of the current Zenith line do come
with 2 communications ports standard.  The second item is
the access time of the hard disk drive.  This would not be
important for use as PSP terminals, but a very slow drive
would decrease the utility of the machines for use in CERL
or in other campus departments.

of the machines, I7d like to have a more presentable
hard copy of it.  Dick Wilson is ready to give us a 
campus backup on the long range purchase of whatever
we decide to take for this year, but he understandably
wants to have an accurate definition of the pig in a 
poke.  Please let me know whenever you get the complete
story.        Ned

One item I was going to bring up with you:
 
Currently "notes" stores the system name of the
note writer while "pnotes" stores the RID.  "xnotes"
stores the system name.  David thinks it would be 
better to store the RID.
 
Possible drawbacks:  the need to do a -setsys-
when displaying notes from remote systems, and
it means that "convert66" will have to change
system names into RID's.
 
Reverse drawbacks:  I guess if we choose to stick
with the system name then the pnote conversion will
have to convert RID's into system names.
 
So, I guess RID's are probably the best way to
go.  Any thoughts?

Well, the explanation I got from Nancy is that
anniversary raises, which consist of rising one
letter grade, were suspended on the day before my
anniversary, effectively blocking out anyone who was
hired after August 21, 1988 (their anniversary
dates were all moved back to Aug. 21, 1989).
So, it is possible for some poor souls (like me) to
have been here for almost two years and never have
gotten any kind of raise except the across-the-board
increase.

who was interested in learning about any OS/2 PM application
development that is happening on this campus.  I knew of 
none in CERL and told him that the rest of the campus is

know of OS/2 PM application development on campus.
Please let me know if you have information on that.

Do you need any information or any resources of any kind
to get started installing your help driver in "xedit"?
Just let me know if you need something.
///
  The installation seems like it will be straight-forward
enough, given that 'xnotes' does a -jumpout- to 'xedit'.
  The driver needs to attach a file, set to a name, read
data into storage, and do a stoload.
  So, the file, file access, and name (if any) have to be
restored on exit, including STOP1.  This seems to indicate
that on entry to 'xedit', we should go ahead and store this
info (in global variables), so we can worry less about
exiting properly on STOP1.
  How much should we worry about the amount of storage
needed?  One "clean" way around the compressed screen
problem is to use -mode erase- to erase the text, but that
would mean having 2 records in storage at the same time.
Record size depends on the size of the largest of the help
pages, but it looks like that should be around 100 words.

some TUTOR commands are in the works to run this process.
As you are aware, we are moving ahead with plans to use the

I need to hold off on the -audio- for a bit.  The MAC 
can make pretty good sounds without extra hardware.
The IBM can make some sounds also without any  extra
hardware.  I have ordered some software to evaluate
this capability on the PC.  Depending on the results
it may affect the design of the -audio- command.
 
What is the time frame in which you need to start
audio work?

Woof -- New notes.  Got an idea.  You mentioned at one
point that sequencing would also be changed.   (Ie, faster.)
Would it be possible to include an option comparable with

the sequencer to grab and download the things I haven't
yet read?  This would be much more palatable than having
to stay dialed in while I read.

Another notes/pnotes suggestion...
 
PROFS allows you to save all notes that you send which is
of course very useful in a CYA business environment, but
it also provides a nice historical record for later review.
That and the ".cc" feature I mentioned earlier are two of
the heavier used features on PROFS.  Also the calendaring
is invaluable when everyone in a 3,000+ person home office
uses it.  IBM mainframes may suck, but they sure to handle
tons of transactions.  Interesting, I wouldn't have been
caught dead talking about IBM mainframes in college.  Hmmm.

Actually the whole thing seems to me to have been done
wrong from the beginning.  If the number stored were one
less than the actual unit length we would have had 512
word units to start with and now have 1024 word units and
the unit length would have indeed been doubled as John
said.  Who ever had a zero length unit anyway?  Such waste
should not be tolerated.  We could have one more word per 
unit!

Here is some fascinating information about the effects of
the NovaPAD (and Metawindow) on the HP Laserjet (serial)
printer, derived from a frustrating Friday afternoon
fighting with the beasts (and it's not only frustrating
because Plato was down all day and because an accounting
error has somehow managed to lose my 9000 free minutes of
dialup time).
 
Yes, the problem is that running the PAD causes the comm
port to be screwed up.  When you leave the PAD (or try to
print from within it), doing any printing causes a data
error on the printer.  But typing the appropriate MODE
command (for instance MODE COM2:96,N,8,1,P) will fix this.
 
The problem is that the messing-up of the COM port occurs
after the "-init" is done.  In fact:
 
* Simply running metawndo, without invoking the PAD, does
  not cause the error.                                  ->

* Once you run the PAD, the error condition is in effect.
* Shelling out with ALT-Z, the error is (of course) still
  in effect.  Running a MODE then fixes it.  BUT returning
  to the PAD (with "exit") re-scrozzles the comm port.
* Having the MODE command as your ALT-E command has the
  same effect.
 
The problem is, obviously, "how do we do the necessary comm
port fix, at some point after Metawindow has done its dirty
work?"  It seems to do it more than once.  I did not try
a -local execute- MODE due to Plato being down, but if
it works anything like ALT-Z and ALT-E it won't do the
trick.  "-init" does what it's told, but it does it too
soon I fear.  You can add the appropriate extensions to
the PAD with the source code, I suppose.
 
If anyone would like to look at an on-campus setup using the
HP Laserjet (serial), stop by the Chem. Placement office on
the ground floor of Noyes Lab.  They are using a different
machine for the L1PP (w/Proprinter) but the other's there...

The capability to archive several times into the same file
seems so valuable; that I favor doing it despite the 
problems.  I expect many notesfiles which had many small 
archive files will shift to having just one big archive as
a result of this new capability.  If there are several
archives, overlapping dates are, I think, a minor 
inconvenience which, as you say, we can undo with further
work.

Reviewing notes from status meeting:
 
-- we noted that we needed a better definition for
        archives.  Can you provide that?
                Not directly.  The comment refers to
                the question of what it means to have
                archives with overlapping dates -- do
                we allow them, how do we disallow them,
                and if allowed how should they be dis-
                played on the notesfile directory page.
 
-- noted that you are going to move back to file cleanup
        and archive when done with link stuff.
                Right.  Still my intention.  I'm knocking
                items off the link/runner to-do list and
                and am making good progress.  I hope to
                be able to start thinking about file
                cleanups by the end of this week.

IBM L1PP 1.60 will have all the things that were in the
"Georgia" test disk.  The manual is in revision right now.
There are only about 3 things I know of that need 
attention in the code before a release, none of them
serious.  We have had some weird things happen at terminals
using IBM L1PPs in the building in the past couple of days
but I doubt the L1PP is at fault.
 
We want to get 1.60 out by 10/1/90, but I'm not sure we
will make it.  I'll consult with the person doing the
manual revsions and she what she projects.

Hi Albert,
 
Have you gotten started on adding your help window
routines to the text editor?
///
I have not yet changed 'xedit'.
 
After I finish checking out some groups (because of the
problems early last evening), I will want to start making
changes.  I think it'd be best if I had a copy of 'xedit'
to work with, so that my modifications can be installed a
chunk at a time.  I'll have to modify some units to
handle "reploting" for terminals that don't support -image-.

Steve mentioned that you told him to strip out all
of the initialization parameters except file type.
That's fine with me.  However, we do need to make
accounts and operator smart enough to lengthen or
shorten the common when the file size is changed.
"xnotes" can sense the length of the common and
set "f.bases" accordingly.
 
In pnotes files, the user's personal "maxnotes" setting
is important.  The common must be long enough to handle 
that many entries, and again, when the setting is changed,
it must also change the common size.

Steering Committee Members:
I am inserting a portion of a note Ned and I received from 
Sid Alpert later Friday PM.
__________
 
Effective this week, Mike Behar has been elected
President and CEO of UCI, while I have been kicked
upstairs and will remain as Chairman of the Board.
What this means is that Mike now runs the company, makes 
the day to day operational decisions, etc.,while I con-
centrate upon policy matters. I will remain involved in
contract matters in particular,especially the CSUS
negotiation.But, for all operational matters in the 
future,you should start with Mike, then Frank(who also
will continue to provide services to UCI).Of course, Mike
Smith will continue in his present position.

So, pigs DO fly, eh?  o+V
 
If the other hoefuls might be or do turn out to be
acceptable, then you have more than one acceptable
candidate -- some just disqualify themselves for an offer.
Also, I think it is only important to explain WHY the
others are NOT acceptable; it is not (necessarily) your
fault that only one (of 4) was offered (and accepted) the
job.  If you showed good faith in looking, then you're OK.
 
In a REAL job hunt, the best candidate often is lost to
a better-paying/-located/-etc. job (as you probably know
from DuoSoft).  If you can explain WHY you DIDN't hire the
folks that AA is watching out for, then the worst they can
claim is that the search was too narrow or incomplete.
And you've gotten nowhere with that (valid) point at CERL.
 
Ho hum.  You've gone through the process and I guess you'll
have to play fair whether WMM did or not and work with Q.

Dale,
I have version 1.50b here at home.  I tried to ue the ALT-t
feature to send myself a pnote (one page of ASCII text). 
Since the KERMIT options are presently vague and because
I recall using ALT-t successfully with the 1.00 version, I
thought it would be cool.  I got an error which went to
the pnote author I guess.  Prehaps I'll see it in sysnotes
or some other notesfile when I get to the office this
morning.  Anyway.  since it is important that the author of
the manual knows what she is doing I decided to write a note
to you.  HELP!!!!!  Do you have any clues?
Merci.
Deborah

Not soon.  We're going to NY in October for Laurene's
sister's wedding.  To NY again for Christmas.  We might
have my great aunt up here for Thanksgiving.  We will be
going to NY again sometime next year (April is my guess)
for Laurene's other sister's wedding (sheesh).  We need
to get to California still to scatter my mother's ashes
(per her request) and we're planning a trip to Italy and
Greece probably next fall.
 
I'm hoping to be uninjured enough to test for my black belt
in Chicago this spring so we might be able to swing down to
Champaign then.  It may be summer before that happens
(June).  I would like to visit though since it has been a
while since we've been there.
 
Any chance you are going to be visiting up here?  I noticed
Marty S. is going to Authorware...  anything ever happen
with that company you mentioned that was starting up?  We've
got a guest bedroom optionally equipped with a dog and cats
if you'd like to visit.         Dave

Bahamas sounds great!
 
I think they have already started changing up north and we
are about two weeks behind them.  The weekend of the 29th
might be good.  I suspect the weekend of Oct 6th would be
best but we'll be in NY.  Oct 13th might be good too.
I know the extension service at the UofM here knows that
kind of stuff.  I assume UofI or library would also know.
 
Either the 29th or the 13th (or later) is good for us --
no need to give much notice.
 
This weekend will be interesting.  IDS is relocating its
machine room to a new data center (impressive building) and
my group is involved in the application testing side of the
move.  (3 AM visit to downtown Mpls on Sunday morning, ugh)
 
Time for bed.  Definitely give some thought to coming up.
We can find room for anyone else who might want to visit
too.                    Dave

I suspect that you are correct.  Jim Austin and I have been
discussing ways of acquiring more TCP/IP L1PP related know-
how among ourselves. Of course we can never hope to have the
same level of detail that you and your troops have, but we
should be able to become contributors at a better level than
now.. I would prefer that users be able to directly access
the best resource possible when it makes sense to do so.  In
this case, Dave is clearly  ahead of us in knowledge and I 
would not like to penalize him by forcing him thru us, but
rather in parallel.  Maybe in this case it would be best for
you to deal straight across but keep us copied so we can be
informed and  learning as things go along. We need to talk
with you about our training needs.

Charles,
Another problem with the catalog:
I am limited in character numbers for the title.  Some of
the Delaware lessons have long titles.  I believe I am
bound by copyright laws to enter the correct name.  Surely
a fix can be done so that I can hve space for a lesson title
of 19 words or 3 lines.  Presently I seem to be limited to 
2 lines or 13 words, whichever comes first.  (characters is
probably more accurate)
Celia and I talked about the strangeness of the mastercard
name business.  She said some variable probably gets reset
and hangs around looking for a home (I added the interpreta-
tion).  Those goofy things happen on PCs from time to time;
I guess I thought mainframe programs were better designed
and not so clumsy with what could be a straight forward
data base program.
OOPS! There I go again....
Thanks once again.
One other thing.  Even if I copy an old deactive mastercard
into a new card the date is always TODAY's date.  Why?

The previous note is the note I received from Deborah
about the possibility of changing the length of the 
title of a mastercard.  I am afraid this is a pretty
fundamental change, and would require a lot of work.
Not only would the change itself be a major one, but
many displays would have to be redesigned in order to
accommodate extra lines.
 
One think I don't understand.  Since these lessons were
on the Delaware system they probably were in a catalog
there that had the same restriction.  I wonder if we have
the Deleware database?  It would be interesting to be able
to look at the Delaware catalog, and further, it might be
possible to transfer mastercards from one database to the
other, thus saving the effort of reentering them.
 
I think I have taken care of all her other problems.

Dale,
   On the IBM TCP/IP L1PP, if I assign multiple IP addresses
to the same name in the NOVAE.TEL file, will the code cycle
through the list of IP addresses until it gets a connection?
I have also found that if I don't get a TCP connection, 
control is not returned back to the user and one has to
reboot one's machine.  Is this a know problem?
   Similarly for the MAC TCP/IP L1PP, I know that MacTCP
talks to a nameserver, but if the nameserver returns a list
of IP addresses, does the code cycle through that list until
a connections is established?

So, when is someone going to start a company to build a

and Macintosh as clients.  With an interface to several
popular e-mail packages and PROFS for the large corporate
environment it would be a gold mine.  Now all that's needed
is a few million dollars in venture capital or several
independently wealthy developers, a marketer, etc.
 
Lotus Notes is overkill and too expensive, sigh.
 
Let me know when you hear of this startup -- I'd love to
do it.  (Have even thought of doing a business plan.)

Public Announcement:
 
MacPAD version 0.8 is now available.  MacPAD 0.8 and all
previous versions may be copied for non-commercial purposes
with no charge.
Note that MacPAD is a Level 0 PLATO Terminal Program.  It
is not produced by CERL, and does not include any of the
Level 1 enhancements that are in the L1PP.
Sources to MacPAD 0.8 are available on request through the
Internet only.  E-mail address is tricorn@uiuc.edu.
I will be making a copy of MacPAD 0.8 available to CERL to
distribute as they wish.  It will also be available via
e-mail to the above address (in Stuffit format).  I'll also
see if it can be made available for anonymous ftp from one
of the archives on campus.  If you want to post it to a BBS,
I can make special arrangements to get you a copy if you
have no network access.

Scott has set buckets to catch the link overflow til
morning.  There is nothing more he/I/we can do at this
point.
 
Have you had a chance to look at the -audio- stuff yet?
I intend to put the finishing touches on the L1PP end
starting tomorrow.  If we decide to change from what I
have planned to do I'm going to be wasting my time in
finishing up the L1PP end.  Let me know if I should not
proceed.  I am committed to having something for UCI to
use in TUTOR command form by mid oct.

I need to hold off on the -audio- for a bit.  The MAC 
can make pretty good sounds without extra hardware.
The IBM can make some sounds also without any  extra
hardware.  I have ordered some software to evaluate
this capability on the PC.  Depending on the results
it may affect the design of the -audio- command.
 
What is the time frame in which you need to start
audio work?

I plan to ask Charles or George to add a director option

Bill Strutz says it will cause no problem for him.
I would plan to log such actions to "sysln".
See any problem with that?

Dale,
I am ready to set up a date and time to meet with you 
about the L1PP....SOON.
 
I have some questions about using KERMIT.
And this morning in that Mac session you stopped in on,
I heard for the very first time of TCPIP.  Okay!  Even
if I am not writing the manual for the MS-DOS TCPIP I
really need to have an understanding of how it works.  I
got the impression that the files necessary for running
TCPIP on the PC are part of the disks users get when they
get the L1PP.  That was news to me.  I'll want to at least
mention to unsuspecting users that they'll need another
manual to do the TCPIP access to NOVA or CERL.
 
Let me know when you and I can meet.  I don't have anything 
on my calendar for the rest of this week.
 
Thanks.
Deborah

At the Arrow prompt I tried to type KU and nothing happened.
I really need for someone to explain KERMIT to me.
 
This is frustrating..... I am trying to rewrite a manual
that has features that are not working for me here at home
on a pc that dials into CERL.
 
Now what do I do?
 
Yesterday I was successful using KU and KD in the pnotes
editor at the office.  What's the scoop?  I really feel
stymied...
 
Save this topic for our meeting on Thursday.
Now I am getting line noise on my screen.   Deborah

The reason I can't use KERMIT is because on the Terminal

Why?
I've tried to  select #4 with no success.
WHAT files am I missing?
How can I solve this problem?
 
I'm sending this note to Kurt, too.
 
Thanks.  See you at 10:00 tomorrow (Thursday).

I solved my KERMIT problem by copying the nova.cfg from

1.50b version lives.  SURPRISE!!!!!!  KERMIT now works as
I recall.
 
Thanks anyway.  And let's still investigate whether my
1.50b disks were missing files or some magic computer
codes.

Dale,
Do you want me to talk to Bill about putting the manual
on hold for now?
If there are reasons that you should be the person to 
let him know I have no problem with that.  But let me
know so I can include the information that the manual update
is temporarily on hold in my weekly report. It will probably
be advantageous if we both use the same language.  My under-
standing is that there are no major changes for 1.60.  One
difference is critical-- users should NOT include metawndo
in their novanet.bat file.  We will include an errata sheet
with the disks and/or manual that informs the users and
will strongly suggest that they read and print the file
readme.doc.
Thanks again for your patience in this matter.  I know I
come on rather stong sometimes.  I am still working on 
learning to be a more patient person.  I have always, even
as a small child, been hard on myself when I don't get it
right the first time.  It spills over to those I work with
and some folks are intimidated and turned off by that.  Deb

Having been dealing with images lately, I've begun to think
you might consider supporting GIF files in the L1PP.  
 
Graphical Interchange Format is in the public domain.
Created three years ago by Compuserve to serve as a
standard for general-purpose image exchange, it is machine-
independent, supports any resolution and an arbitrary color
palette, and is extremely space-efficient.  There are also 
many, many pictures available on public bulletin boards and
networks.  It is also supported by many graphics packages,
and there are numerous utilities available.
 
Walden Software has a book entitled "Bitmapped Graphics"
by Steve Rimmer that discusses in detail using both "C" and
assembler to write routines for reading, writing, printing,
converting and processing various picture file formats.  He
covers Macpaint, PCX, GEM/IMG, GIF, TIFF, as well as 
addressing printing images on Epson FX/MX, LaserJet, and
Postcript devices.  A disk of source code is available for
$25 separately.

I see now why I had a fade up and a fade down.
 
The library to the IBM board provides for only two
fades per invocation.  These would most naturally be
a fade up or in and a fade down or out.
 
The context of the library function documentation
suggests that this interface is intended not only as the
interface to this specific board but is more generic.
 
I'm beginning to think that we should approach this a 
little differently:   not report at sign on time whether
or not digitized audio is available but rather provide a
sub command (-audio test-?) that would not only report
whether audio capability was present but also some of its
features such as number of quality levels, number of
channels, number of fades permitted....

Depending on how it was done it could be quite a bit nicer
than the current L1PP (if the classes were put to the
correct use), and could really help portability.
 
I don't think I would want to be the one to start all
over in C++ though.
 
Do you know how good the current C++ compilers for the Mac
and IBM are? I think the MPW C++ is still just a front
end for the C compiler, which may or may not be a Good
Thing.

File this one in your "911" file:
 
If the link dies and the queues start filling up,
go into lesson "s0notrun" and star out the line that
says "do  dequeue".  That'll stop the runner from
propogating notes from s0notesq to s0linkq.
 
If s0notesq then threatens to overflow, you can simply
rename it and insert another 55-gallon drum named
s0notesq to catch the overflow.

I'd say all the parts are clearly on their way to
completion except the director options.  They have fallen
way behind, and it hasn't helped to have four different
people in there doing their own thing.  I'd like to
get some time to get in there and clean things up,
but I'm in the quicksand stage with "xnotes" --
every change I make exposes another bug.
 
Perhaps I can find a good place to stop my work on
pnotes and concentrate on the director options for
a while.  I think it's important to have those done and
ready to be tested by users.

that there are a number of out-of-town people doing so, and
I wouldn't discourage them from it, but we don't have the

In the first sentence, who does "we" refer to?
--------
 
"We" refers to various people who have advised prospective
remote customers about communications methods.  There have
been only a few instances where the customer was curious
about the possibility of Internet access rather than the
usual dedicated serial line, but in each of those cases,
it was clear that we couldn't recommend that method and
be confident that they would receive reliable service.  I
think my error in the comment leading to confusion on
your part is that I really should have said "remote cus-
tomers" rather than "off-campus users".

I still do not fully understand just who is included in
"we" and who is excluded.  The use of "we" in conjuntion
with the "director message" could be construed to mean that
"we" means CERL.  I do not think that is the case.
In particular, I would very much like to hear from people
who have an interest in accessing NovaNET via the internet.
While I agree that we can make no promises regarding
reliability of the service, I would like to encourage
people to try it so that we may learn from the experiences
they have.

I think that's a good idea.  The trick, it seems to me,
is to find a situation where the connection is "close"
enough -- or the application "safe" enough -- that we can
afford to run a paying customer with it.  One such oppor-
tunity is with Caterpillar, which has a direct T1 line
to NCSA.  They were at least mildly interested in the
idea -- NCSA was anxious to have them share the line for
reasons I didn't understand -- but Caterpillar apparently
decided to go with the more usual serial connection for
the time being.  They will hopefully test out the Internet
connection on an ad-hoc basis.

There's another possibility in an upcoming discussion with
Motorola/Schaumberg, where they already have some kind of
Internet access (but we don't yet know what type).  They
will be providing more information this week.
 
Again, I think the most important thing is to find the
right test case.  I don't think we've come across it yet.
I don't think it's appropriate for us to push the issue
so strongly that a customer paying for full service is
receiving something less than full performance without
their knowing from the outset that the reduction in
communication costs might come at the expense of one or
more of the goals CERL has used in designing communication
equipment:  speed, consistency, reliability, and fixability.

One of the things I had in mind was to encourage people
who have internet access now, but would otherwise have to
make a long distance phone call to use NovaNET, to sample
it (no charge) over the internet.  We would have to make
sure they understand that the internet may seriously
degrade response time, but that should be well understood
by people already using say a remote UNIX system over the
internet.
 
Getting more visibility for NovaNET was one of the major
reasons I wanted to see us get the CISCO box in the first
place.

CERL already does this for prospective customer who have
modems.  Our job (as system staff), I think, is to make
sure the people here and at UCI selling the system know
that the Internet connection is one possibility for
sampling the service.  I think, from conversations with
Garrie Burr and Bill Strutz, that that idea is becoming
more well known.

Everyone has a vision.  Here's a piece of mine:
 
On campus, it will dramatically increase our visibility
and may significantly smooth the transition from old-style
PLATO equipment to the newer ASCII world.  There may soon
be customers close by who can use a short-hop Internet
connection to the UI campus to use our service on a more
realistic basis.  As the performance of the nationwide
Internet improves, more people will elect to use it to
talk to us.  (Somewhere in the middle of step two, we
will probably outgrow the current generation of CISCO
equipment.  By the time step three is a strong possibility,
TCP/IP may well have been supplanted by OSI.)

That is a reasonable, and I think appropriate, progression
in our use of the Internet as a communication medium.  It
allows for local use first, where we have the best ability
to help diagnose and fix problems, and where we can get
our own support staff exposed to the nuances of network
use.  It assumes a modest outgrowth to nearby customers
when we have some experience and acceptable test cases.
It defers the issue of nationwide Internet use until the
performance improves and we can provide reasonable support
for the service.

And a truer, more dedicated, more tolerant group of CERL
advocates you will not find, but their use of the system
is sporadic to say the least.  On the flip side of the coin
you have Joe Naines, who has No Clue what he's doing but
is convinced he can use Internet for it, and Mike O'Brien
who played around for a bit then (apparently) succumbed
to the TCP acknowledge problem.

This is only relevant in that it's about "execfind", but
is it possible to permit the standard system bypass of
codewords there?  It's a nice capability, but it is
nearly useless to me as a fixer of bugs in catalog files.
I can, but it is not generally an acceptable alternative,
change file codewords, since I can't change them back, and
in some circumstances that is the recipe for disaster.

I just looked into the lastest release of packet drivers
that we have.  It looks like we should be able to use
one on NOVELL for IMSA.  I gave the info to Frye.
It also looks like there is a packet driver for NetBIOS.
This should let Gary Michael and company talk to NovaNET
while  still using thier network and servers.
 
Also, there were some remarks about comming support for
PC-NFS.  This may solve the Vet-Med problems.

Hi!
 
        I talked with Perry Wagner ( /iu ) about his problem
with the U/B terminal boxes eating XOFF.  The solution
finally turned out to be having him use subtype 17 and 
knowing about ESC d,e,f,g instead of DC1,2,3,4....  He made
the minor coding changes to his pad and everything seemed
to work.  (You did all this wonderful work for the CDC/TRO
folks 4 months back..)
 
There isn't any problem with this solution, is there?

Hurray... here I am writing to you via the Mossberg Server
and Orpheus.  The restrictions are a real pain, but no
matter.  What is really interesting is the weird response
you get when you press keys.  Orpheus sends your data at
some high speed to Mossberg, which shoves them upstream
at 2400 baud to your modem.  So all of a sudden, STOP
doesn't stop plotting, PLATO doesn't seem to respond to
your keystrokes very fast, and (oh joy) there is essentially
infinite typeahead.  I wrote a note in a notesfile while
watching another note plot.  It is kind of fun, but I'm
wondering if you have figured out any way to deal with it.
It's very disorienting after a while... Of course, perhaps
you haven't noticed it, not having dialed up via Mossberg?
 
Hm, perhaps the next version of the L1PP should have
scripts so I don't have to keep typing "term download"
and "rlogin orpheus".
 
Thank you for the prompt response on the underline fix,
by the way!

The ~ causes a 1 second pause in data being sent to the

in execution.

The design looks good.  Thank you for showing me.  I have
a couple of comments:
 
1) if "0" means "not tagged", I think it wise to say it
   rather than imply it.  If the lines were something like:
   "archive if tag is any of:   no tag  1  2  3  4  5  6  7
    delete  if tag is any of:   no tag  1  2  3  4  5  6  7"
   good things happen:  no interpretation of "0" is needed,
   and users are explicitly cued that they can select more
   than one tag.  I assume defaults are "all off" somehow.
 
2) If the user pushes the radio button for "tag selection"
   archiving/deleting, it would probably be helpful for the
   tag-texts to appear after pushing and before selecting.
   Some people may remember them, some may not -- reminding
   helps.  Is there room at the bottom of the screen?

Ie, instead of (mandatorily) having to say:
        name > sinder
        group > s
        system > {cerl}
 
I'd like to be able to (optionally) say:

        group >
        system >
 
Where the arrow would detect the '/' char and say "Oh, he's
using the optional one-line form of address."  Of course,
the system name would still be optional, as it is now.
 
Since the '/' char is currently illegal in a name, I would
think this would be a fairly easy change to make.  How does
that sound to you?

If the Postscript generated by the L1PP is fully conformant

Perhaps I can bug you one more time and yet another

As you can tell from my account name I have a guest account
and I'm restricted to the Plato system at the U of Hawaii
which isn't too terribly bad but it isn't the same as
having full Internet or Bitnet access.  I recently found
that I can even send out for things like RFC documents
well I can send out the request but I will never receive
the document.  To make a long story short do you have any
ideas how I might secure an official account ?  I looked
for Bitnet/Internet references at the UH library but
came up empty handed.  I'd consider "buying in" to the
net if I knew how much or whom to pay but a free account
sounds better but "beggars..." as they say can't be choosy

Hi Dale - we are having keycaps made up for our IBM 
keyboards that list the Plato functions of the F1-F10
keys.  Since version 1.60 has added the F11 and F12 keys,
should we use those keys instead of F1 and F10?  It is
costing us $1500 to have the caps made up for sets of
10 keys and we really don't want to add two more keys,
not to mention the confusion to the user of having 
two copy and stop keys.  I know the change was made for
Windows and some of our users will run Plato within
that enviroment, but we wondered which keys we should
tell our users to use?  Thanks.

Hi,
 
        Nancy indicated to me that she is waiting for
some sort of go ahead from you for ordering the next
batch of L1PP keyboard stickers.  She also says she will
be running low soon since she either has or is aware of
a sizable order comming in from UCI.

I don't know if it is or not yet.  We are trying to decide
how UCI will meet the FBOP requirments for audio CW and we
are looking at several ways to do it.  One would be to do
the stuff using the current kludge just to meet the early
installs. I guess what I was looking for when I talked with
bruce about it was when/whether the decision had been made
re the TUTOR extensions and the L1PP was final.  Bruce is
looking for info and not setting priorities at this point.

I was more than a little discouraged by UCI response to
questions about building Zephyrs.  The way I interpret what
I heard is that UCI does not want to do the technology
transfer that I thought was fundamental to the agreement
between the University and UCI.  They would like us to
provide cheap, reliable service and they would like us to
to design and build a system which neither we nor they have
yet to fully conceptualize.
 
They also intend to grow slow enough so that they have to
take as little risk (such as investing in a system) as
we will let them get away with.
 
While I have been a strong supporter of UCI in order that
we can accomplish the mission we set out to do, I now see
little to encourage me that this can happen with UCI as
the sole marketer of NovaNET service.

They appear to be willing to pay the cost of doing business
only to the extent of conducting support and installation
services, "marketing", and paying for ports which we have
(in my opinion) under priced.
 
It appears that one of the things they fear most is fast
growth as a result of NovaNET success which would require
them to make commitment to running a system of thier own
in order to meet demand and fullfill their obligations.
 
I'm not much interesting in being a part of NovaNET growing
at a "survival pace".  I'm not much interested in 
constructing a system to UCI specs while under time and
reliablity pressure from UCI.  If I want to do that I can
very quickly find a place in private industry.
 
What does our agreement with UCI give them marketing rights
to?  Does it include things which have not yet been 
conceptualized?

In fact irregular distribution of royalties can have

Hi Jim,
 
It seems there are people on your systems who would like to
be able to link to our systems and get L1PP features.
They can not do this at the present time because CDC/TRO
systems do not know how to treat subtype 116.  Could you
twiddle some things to recognize 116 as a color terminal?
That should let them get L1PP features when they link to
use.

Hi Dale,
 
I just had a call from Jim Simon who asked us to send
a report on the equipment we received for our Innovations
project to Paul Hardin.  The report should state whether
anything is missing and should follow the requirements
stated on some yellow form sent to the grant recipients by
Paul Hardin on September 10.
 
Jim does not have the form, and he thinks that you have
all the information on what we were supposed to receive 
and what we actually received.
 
He would like to have copies of all the documents we have.

I haven't converted the stuff I've written to use
the code from "daudio" yet, but I don't anticipate any
problem.  The routines there cover things pretty well.
-do   audfile(n1,n2,n3,nadnauseum)- to pass a long
string is gross, and not immediately self-documenting.
On the other hand...
 
I still would like more stuff in the package for file
management, particularly, deleting files.  It'd also be
nice to have a way to ask for a list of available audio
files.  Error reports regarding missing files, bad file
specs, full disks, etc. are also pretty much of a
necessity.

You have a return argument for the "audsrt" function, but
you don't seem to be returning anything.  "audstop" doesn't
have such a provision, which makes me thing the one for

After doing some scrounging, it looks to me like group files
are not now using word 39 for anything.  (For lessons, this
word is allocated as "lesson type word".  I have doubts that
this means anything.) Note that #39 means 39+extrai, and
extra=5, so we're talking about word 44 out of 64 words in
sector 0, or word 39 out of 59 "extra info" words.
I will add a comment in neditdefin that this word is alloca-
ted for groups for the default mailbox file name.  Ok?

I will send you a copy.
 
A pnote is better than face-to-face conversation.  As you
could see, I am on the brink of professional disaster.  My
final blowup might as well be over my own problems rather
than over someone else's turf battles.
 
I appreciate Kurt's efforts.  After watching him and talking
to him, I understand better how the TCP/IP works.  All of
the L1PP questions I have dealt with recently have concerned
the TCP/IP version.  CERL has already benefited from
immediate installation of the hardware and software on my
system because I can answer these questions better.  That
doesn't mean that I won't have to get help from an s person
(I guess that will be David hereafter), but I can handle
more myself.

Copy of a note I sent to David Frye:
 
David,
Yesterday Bill Golden handed me an Ethernet card with no
explanation.  I sought and found someone to install it on
my system:  Kurt Mahan.  Kurt explained that he was not
supposed to, but since he was available, I asked if he would
install it so I could start working in this area.  I have
had frequent calls on using the TCP/IP version of the
Protocol Program.
 
For testing, Kurt used a temporary address.  He removed it
and told me to ask you for a permanent one.
 
The installation works, and I understand now how to change
my own configuration to connect to NovaNET through Ethernet.

Just running over in my mind some of the things you
should consider in your report on E-Mail:
 
approx number of lines of code written (C and TUTOR)
 
estimate of how much time it would take to complete
(on present course)
 
outline of the course you have been following
 
sources you have consulted in arriving at where you are
now (e.g. peltz, bauer code, jenny, reference materials....)
 
recommendations on what you see as a productive course to
pursue.
 
basically, assume you had been given a class research
project and are writing a report on what you found.

It just occurred to me that the NIU switch that is planned
will have to be able to load terminal residents.  Otherwise
terminals that require a loaded resident will not be able
to do anything if they loose power while in the switch.
--------
 
(Cringe.)  The easy way to solve this, at least at the
outset, is for the switcher to recognize the autoload key
and force the terminal onto one system or the other for
the purpose of loading the terminal resident.

The message (Unchanged) is confusing.  I helped someone in-
stall the 1.60 NAD and the user said, "What does that mean,

I also find it confusing, especially since I've been messing

Would it be possible to have a parameter on the "multi-block
upload" feature that would specify how much free space to
leave in each block?  Currently it just packs each block
as full as it can, then creates a new block and continues.
It would be nice if it were ppossible to say "Leave at least
30 words in each block as you do this.", or something like 
that.

hi dale,
i am finally able to reproduce that trap bug i found in
july.  im in the demo room, using v. 1.50 (i think).
 
first, you must initialize things by exiting to dos.
 
then, get signed onto novanet.
go into lesson x0curvefit (backup of curvefit from july).
choose option 2, to use permanent data.
enter nameset = fplotns, codeword = fplotns.
enter nameset name = 10.
on the index page, choose option g (to graph the data).
after the plotting is done, return to the index page, and
enter option g again.  the graph is now in monochrome, and
there's an ampersand ampersand p at the top.
 
if you leave the lesson and re-enter it, this error won't
recur.  you must first exit to dos, then re-enter the
lesson.  if you do that, the error will occur again.  (does
that give you a hint as to what's wrong)?

Dale,  Hi.  A couple of us have been working on digitizing
images using AVC, despite the negative aura Arthur Baskin
is exuding, and I wondered if you can advise me about the
.pcx connection.  When I p-noted Gary Michael about this
he said he would run a routine that would capture the 
AVC screen image, store it into a .pcx file and then
TenCORE, and Kraatz said TUTOR, will be able to fetch this
image back while running a lesson.
My question is:  (since I'm not familiar with IBM graphics
packages) do we have to go out and buy a copy of this ...
graphics utility so that we can try capturing some of our
250+ AVC images to .pcx so as to wow a few profs and dean
types later this week or next week.
What is the graphics package, and where can we get it?
Thanks in advance.

Hi!  About the Bahamas trip: I have been holding off on
buying plane tickets in the hope that prices would go down.
Unfortunately, that has not happened, the Middle East is
the same as ever.  So I was going to go ahead and buy
tickets for everyone flying fromm Champaign.  The tickets
are $100 more than last year due to Middle East prices --
they will be a little under $300 (I wont know exact price
till I order).  If you do not want me to buy tickets for 
you, please let me know right away.
 
Also, on a more personal note, there is something I wanted
to say for a while...  I am really glad you are going on
this trip.  Often I feel competitive and defensive around
you; I apologize for that, I hope I can get over it.  Going
on the trip together and doing such a major fun thing might
help.  I have these sorts of competitive/defensive feelings
with Z in the past, too -- and the trips really helped.  I
dont want to make too big a deal out of this; I just wanted
to tell you I am really glad you are going.

Do you have a projection for when you expect to have the
linking options finished?
--------
 
Notes and pnotes are done.  Director options were half done
before xnotesys was rewritten so that probably has to be
done over.  Mailing lists need to be done.  Given my choice,
I'd rather do the director options now but I'll check with
Scott.  I'm inclined to give a pessimistic projection right
now because of the Cyber mystery problem that has been occu-
pying part of my time.  So, let's say director options more
or less working by 12/10, mailing lists by 12/21, then a
major round of testing that should take two weeks or so.

Wednesday it will have been 1/4 of a year since I 
communicated to you my deep concern regarding unresolved
Security committee issues.  We have met and talked about
them.  We have even gotten PSO help in writing some new
help.  But on two major issues, passwords and dialup
disconnect, our users see nothing different than they
did when the problems were first reported to us, which
is now nearly a year.
 
I do plan to raise these issues at our normal Monday
meeting (unless you would prefer to discuss them
privately).

developing a custom software development capability under

is very exciting. It certainly could open the door to
the best of both possible worlds. Iknow you have many

I would welcome the opportunity to work with you. Let

I talked with Mike Smith.  The offer from Georgia is rather
vague.  He talked with Kris Biesing; but does not know who
she had in mind to do the work or what level of committment
she intended.  
 
I have written to Kris suggesting review of our new manual
and/or a TCP/IP supplement.  She is out of town until next

One of the things I have heard Rick express an interest
in is compression of output bound for terminals.  This
could be accomplished by adding a post processor to data
about to be passed from the ascii formattor to the framer.
The addition of an expander to the L1PP would then give us
better use of our limited output channel as well as
improving net data rate to terminals.  However, it would
place more of a load on the Zeyphrs due to the additional
processing due to the compression and that a given baud
rate channel to a terminal would suck down more data and
therefore cry for additional executor time per user to
generate the output....

Kurt:
 
Michael passed on the question (via Dale) about putting a
password on the CISCO console line so it could be connected
to via a TELNET session and you could see the list of
active connections.  I have opted not to do this at this
time, since it seems to me that "finger @pandora" will do
just as well for what you need.  The CISCO manual is a
bit vague on the question of the security implications of
putting a password on the line, and I haven't had time to
research the question.  I do hope to look at it more
thoroughly sometime when I have more time.

Two things:
 
D. Little is concerned that the index in editds that has
the Kermit options is missing option 7 when you are editing
a dataset (option 7 is nameset editing features), and 
suggests this is user unfriendly, and that the design be
reworked. My view is it can't be very much of a problem
because no user, except Little, has ever commented on it.
I tolk her I would mention this to you.
 
Second, I was thinking that it might be fairly easy to get
a form of the -file- command, limited to create and destroy
of namesets and datasets only, working with the current
accounts database.  It could then be released independent
of the new accounts stuff.  Do you think that might be worth
a weeks work?

Let's talk about this one.  I see no need to rush to get
this limited set available.  We have done without it for
ten years.  A few more months will make no difference.
My basic position is that if you would find this a more
comfortable or more fulfilling way to proceed I have no
objection, but I don't see that it's worth any extra
effort unless you attach some value to it.

course, our interpretations of what happened are different
and the differences are worth discussing.
 
Is that ok?

Dale,
    I have a question about memory.  I have a ps-2/70 set
up just like Jim Kraatz's (I think) and I want to be able
to use pcxgrab to capture some Audio-Visual Connection (AVC)
images.  
    I digitized all these images while running AVC from OS2.
Now I have the computer set up with DOS 4.0 and qemm.sys
and AVC runs fine, if just a little bit more slowly.
However, when I load the TSR pcxgrab(which takes up only
35,000+ bytes, AVC will no longer run because of "not enough
memory".
    On a machine with 3968KB OK memory on boot-up how can 
this be?

Dale,
 
For the next few weeks I am will be going over to the
library a few afternoons a week and working on my Cerl
duties in the evening, this because the library is not
open in the evening during the intersession.  This should
work out, because I am now at the point of needing some 
nonprime time testing for the -file- command.
 
If this is going to be a problem, or if you want me to be
around on a particular afternoon just let me know.

It is hard to think of a group that could retain the
flavor of PUG membership and drop either the networking
concept or the TUTOR connection.  At the risk of being
misinterpreted by the "pure" network types:

Notes from the 12/18 steering committee.
 
Ned opened up the meeting talking about "Spud". He says
that he has no serious objections to "Spud" (names like
Quark are used by High Energy Physicists), but he
thinks names should be cleared with the Steering
Committee before being introduced to a wider audience.
 
Pence reported that the lab can acquire at least 64
ISTs, 24 would cost $200, the rest would be freebies
because of defects.  Stifle says it'll cost $30/terminal
to fix up the first 24.  These may not be available til 6/1.
 
Judith Liebman told Ned that we shouldn't work on an
adapter for PLATO IVs and shouldn't even be installing
ISTs.  We should only be installing PCs in our campus
sites.  Dick Wilson and George Badger say that computers
have a 2-4 year life expectancy before they become
obsolete. So there are a lot of old PCs on campus that
aren't being used that could be used for NovaNET. ->

Ned visited some Chicago sites recently.  Wendell Phillips
reminded him of a prison and the teachers weren't
"expert" with using NovaNET.  They have no idea how
to raise funds to continue the program.  (Ned will be
meeting with all Chicago principals in January to
talk about funding.)  Ned was very impressed with
Holy Angels and their use of NovaNET.  Holy Angels sees
no problem with increasing the tuition to cover NovaNET
operating budget.  They aren't sure where to get the money
to buy terminals, however.  Ned also thought the Dawson
Skills center was very well run.
 
Bill Golden asked about the IST boot problem and Stifle
said that Kurt Mahan has fixed some bugs in the Roms
which are currently being tested in Centralia.  
Jim Frazier, Motorola, says that the T1 connection is
working well with their Macs, but security is still a
concern.  Motorola also wants the access program for SUN
workstation...I think Bill will talk to you more about 
that.  ->

Dorothy Silver said that an article in Futurist about
NovaNET generated 80 calls to the lab.  (You can see
her about getting a copy of the article- it was about
2 paragraphs long.)  One of the calls was from
Chicago First National Bank.  They want to put 1000
NovaNET terminals into 1000 homes to increase educational
level of potential employees.  They are talking about
spending 2 Million dollars on this.  Ned doesn't think
they have a very effective plan.
 
Fyre met with the Campus Computing and Networking 
Committee.  Some concerns raised there were what to
do with old PCs on campus and what kind of computer
skills should incoming freshman be expected to have.
Frye received a letter from George Badger asking about
number and sizes of PLATO sites on campus and asked
whether PLATO sites could be converted to CSO public
sites for access to PLATO and PC applications.  This
would cause a problem if run over the campus backbone.

Fyre talked about the seminar he gave.  One discussion
generated by the seminar was being able to get the
class rosters from Admissions and Records and using
a gradebook package for managing grades.  The Physics
gradebook package isn't universally loved within
Physics and has not been well recieved outside of the
Department.  Fyre would like CERL to consider developing
a gradebook package.  It may be a project that would
be important to the campus.  (I would be interested
in working on such a project..if I could find the time..)
 
Pence has the University policy on security and access
to student records.  See him if you want a copy.

Some calls have come in about the letter sent to
campus users.  Stan Smith is afraid to update his lessons
so that they can run on PCs because of the Authoring
Agreement.  Ned will look into this problem.
 
Dorothy Silver reported that Dan Cole will start working
for UCI from home on Jan. 2nd.  Mike Smith says that
the California contract will be signed on 12/20,
on 12/11 a contract was signed between UCI and Iowa,
DMAC contract will be signed on 12/18, Iowa Dept.
of corrections will sign contract for reduced

Al Avner reports that Lee Fillman has met with
the Unit IV schools.  They will be increasing the
number of NovaNET terminals in 4 magnet and alternative
education schools, but decreasing the number of terminals
in the other schools.  Ned said that he asked Lee to
write a proposal to convert CERL classroom to PCs. ->

Hey, Dale ...
 
Did you ever release your PAD for M'soft Windows as a
real product?  If so, I'd like to buy one ...  Also, did
you make a 3.0-compatible version?
 
In any case, I lost the diskette you sent me and my
hard drive had a failure (I use a non-partitioned 150MB
drive on DOS 4.01 and I made the mistake of using
SmartDrive on it, so it trashed it), so I would like to
get a Windows-PAD from you while I'm here in town (until
Sunday the 30th).
 
Thanks,

Dale, does Steve's suggestion give a good criterion for
this feature?  Aid states that "zttrap" indicates whether
the terminal supports -trap- and___ -stretch-.  Also, I read
into the information you gave me that it isn't -trap- in
general that is available only with MS-DOS, but the "!"
representation for the path (I am not saying that my
interpretation is correct).
 
Can you help?

Should such a restriction be stated in AID? It seems likely
that it will be available on other platforms eventually.
There is a reserved word which says whether it is available
or not.

Dale,
I keep forgetting to ask you if you've asked anyone in
your group about LinkUp or Cactus.  Have you?  Any strong
responses to either?  Any proposed alternatives?
A recap at this point is:
        LinkUp  Cactus  CBElink
Bill    okay    okay    okay    any one of these is okay
Tebby   yes     NO!     no
Jim     okay    okay    NO!
Celia   yes     No!     no
Elaine  no      no      no
Darlene ok      No      okay-favorite, but can accept LinkUp
Deborah yes     NO!     not really, but can accept CBElink
 
It looks like LinkUp is the most popular name of the three
in the above list.  I'll think about other names at home.
Bill's brain is still churning out ideas-- he just stopped
in to say I-link, but emphasized he is not pushing that or
any of the others he's suggested.

Hi Dale,
 
I'm sorry to welcome you back to town with a note like
this, but I thought you should know how I feel about
things regarding Kurt and the Email project.
 
I just got out of a meeting where Kurt made several
subtle backhanded swipes at Jenny.  The kicker came
afterward when Jenny told him that she was using "gin"
as the RID for the new system, and Kurt turned his thumb
down and said, "The name sucks, dear."
 
Frankly, I find this rudeness inexcusable.  It doesn't
take a rocket scientist to figure out that he's upset at
having the project taken away from him.  I understand
that.  But if he cannot be a team player, then I would
rather not have him in this game.
 
Sorry,
Scott

Ned,
 
I have had a chance to reread the eval. committee report and
your draft response.  I think the only comment I have to
make at this point is to agree with the basic findings on
page 3 of the report but expand on them a bit.
 
I think CERL needs substantial reorganization and
restaffing.  I think such a task has to be undertaken by
CERL itself if it is to be successful.  University support
will be required for the undertaking, but CERL is the sick
organism that needs treatment and must be a willing
participant in that treatment.

Some CERL heads of staff have become too "set in the old
ways" by virtue of long association with the Lab and Don
Bitzer.  On the whole they have become too content and
expect too little of the people who report to them.  The
result of the low expectations is low productivity and
lowering of self esteem which then feeds lower productivity.
The Lab as a whole has been resting on its laurels and
content with "PLATO" but at the same time frustrated by lack
of forward progress "beyond PLATO".  Some CERL heads of
staff well recognize the lack of progress but fail to make
progress towards fixing the problem due to what I think must
be "tired blood".  CERL needs a substantial transfusion of
new blood to mix with the old blood to carry the Lab "beyond
PLATO".
 
I recall a quote attributed to Thomas Edison:  "Discontent
is the first necessity of progress."  CERL has been too
content with "PLATO" and failing to make progress 
"beyond PLATO."          -- A CERL Malcontent

A quick question regarding a problem I'm experiencing with
a new VGA micro.  Does the following make any sense to
you?  Running L1PP v1.6 the color palette is usually set
wrong and when going from one full screen to another the
characters "Nep @" and "L2/p @" appear with regularity
(frequently in the upper left corner of the screen).  Both
standard 480-line VGA mode and -v512 generate this result
-- they kinda work, but something is not getting
interpreted correctly.
 
It all looks like phone line errors but the display errors
are too uniform.  Also, the login page where you enter
your password appears to display in black on black, but
when the password is typed the XXX appears as usual.
 
I'm stumped ...  the unit is a Dell 386sx laptop running
an external VGA monitor that is supposed to be register
compatible with IBM VGA.  Hayes 2400bps modem (25 pin)
into a 9-pin com port via an adapter plug.

Hi Dale,
 
Here are my notes from the Steering Committee meeting.
 
Ned has thought of an idea for how to help off-campus users
with the fees associated with the transfer to Nova.  CERL
could buy whatever equipment would be needed and then
extend the amount of time that the sites have to pay the
current connection fees until the equipment is paid off.
When the equipment is paid off, their usage fee would go
down to the $63/month rate.  This would make it easier for
the sites to deal with their budget and their administrative
types.
 
Bob Anderson talked about the CCA corridor space problem.
Helen K is moving to the 3rd floor.  Dorothy Silver wants
to combine her staff into the remaining offices so that
her staff will remain in one place.  (This is just  a
temporary problem while remodeling is going on.)

Ned reports that the advisory committee is working on 
their reply to the External Review.  He would like their
reply to be in before the end of January in hopes of
speeding up the process.  Esther wrote Ned a memo about
her experiences with the College of Education when she
taught a course over there.  Her experience was very
unsatisfactory, the College was not at all interested in
her or her work.  Ned forwarded the memo to Judith who
replied that she was concerned about Esther's negativism
with regard to the CERL - College of Education relationship.
Ned has met with the Dean of the College of Education who
is enthusiastic about a CERL - Education relationship,
although he can't draw interest from much of his faculty.
 
Ned is trying to find funding to continue PSP program.
He will ask Lee Fillman to leave Al Avner's group and become
Assit. to the Director to take over the responsibilty of
finding funding to continue this program.  Ned is meeting
with Walt Washington and the Principals next week to talk
about the funding alternatives.  (continued)

track.
 
David Frye reported that George Badger called a meeting with
Frye, Dick Wilson, and someone from Campus housing.  The
meeting was called because of a memo from Judith Liebman
about CERL being able to use obsolete PCs on campus.
Badger may have some obsolete PCs that CERL could use.
Badger was also concerned about whether his sites would
get flooded with PLATO students trying to connect over
the network when the Cyber is disconnected.  David
reports that Dick Wilson reports that FLB is likely to
get campus computer funds to replace their PLATO IVs but
that CERL is unlikely to get funding to replace the IVs
in the CERL classrooms.

With the CISCO server otherwise unoccupied tonight, we
verified that there is some kind of bug in the IBM L1PP
with regard to opening and closing connections.  Sequence
of events is:
 
1. Open connection to vulcan.
2. Get back to PNTB, Alt-Q to close connection.
   At this point, CISCO thinks the connection is still
   intact.
3. Open a new session to vulcan.
4. Get back to PNTB, Alt-Q to close connection.
   Both connections are still listed as active.
5. Exit the L1PP.
   Now the first_____ connection is closed, but the second
   connection (and any additional ones) is still open.
 
This was done on Chris's 30/286 with L1PP 1.60x.  The Mac
does not behave similarly, so we are ruling out the server.

The NovaNET Users Group annual conveference is comming up
at the end of March or beginning of April.  The president
of NUG, Shawn Lamaster, has put out a call for presentations
by CERL staff.  One of the suggested presentaions was on
the topic of the new notes system.  Scott Johnson, who has
done most of the programming on the project, has said that
he would be willing to make such a presentation at NUG.
I think this would be a very good idea.  Not only would
this be a valuable opportunity for our users at NUG but
it would also provide Scott with an opportunity to met
and talk with our users in the field.  I have found such
visits in the past to be very revitalizing and energizing.
Would the Lab be able to pay the expenses of sending Scott
to NUG to make a presentation on notes?

Hi Shawn,
 
I have gotten funding from Ned Goldwasser to support sending
some "System Applications" staff to NUG.  Scott Johnson is
willing to give a session on the new notes system.
I would be willing to do something also.  I'd prefer not
to do L1PP things this time.  Any ideas?

Ned,
 
Thanks for the letter concerning my notes on the External
Evaluation Committee report and campus action.  The evening
I wrote those remarks I was about to embark on a long string
of notes expressing disagreement with the report.  Then 
when I reread the report it struck me that comments I had
heard from other members of the Steering Committee made it
clear that there would be no shortage of remarks disagreeing
with the report.  So I decided to try to find something with
which I could agree in the report.
 
I very much appreciate that you remembered our conversation
of a couple of months ago.  I do plan to wait for campus
action before taking any further action regarding my
work at CERL.
 
Thanks,
Dale

Sorry about that... nugnotes is public file, isn't it....
If no one has a response after mine, I'll change my note.
 
I had also put some suggestions in pnote form, and felt
the note in the file required a "cerl presence" in the
responses.  
 
I know better than to speak for others... I truly forgot
I wasn't in our "just us" file.

is an audience for it.
 
How about new notes... will we be ready to show that off?

In "nugnotes" we is NUG.  NUG does not know.
I already have an offer in to Shawn for Scott Johnson

Hi Dale -- this note is a followup to the problem I told
you about a week or so ago regarding VGA displays getting
scrozzled on my new Dell computer.
 
The problem still exists on the new unit they sent me.
Their technical support staff asked me to fax them the
pnote you sent me describing what you suspect the problem
is.  They called back today and said, more or less, ...
hmmm, that sounds like a bug alright!  They asked for your
phone number and I gave them the one you have listed in
the system nova directory of authors.
 
I hope that is OK.  Everyone at Dell that I've dealt with
has been great, and they seem to want to figure this out and
fix it.  The guy I talked to (Anthony) said he'd have to
discuss it with their VGA bios specialists and would
probably give you a call in a week or two.
 
Thanks for you help with this.

Hi Dale, 
Two questions for you.  First, has there been any reports
about the Mac LC and its compatability with the L1pp?  We
have 2 sites that would like to use them.  Second, have
there been any reports about screen print problems?  We
have several sites that are experiencing problems after
having 'worked for months.' The symptoms seem to be
starting to print one line and then stopping.  Any
thoughts would be appreciated.

Here's what needs doing to "xnoterun", in the order I'd
like to do it:
 
1. old pnotes -> xnotes conversion (xnotes->opnotes done)
2. mailing list pnote to non-xnotes target
3. old-new pnotes test kludge (more about that below)
 
4. "change note header" request
5. "file busy" handling (off, full, dir opts in use)
6. link/unlink file
 
7. general error handling
8. trace improvements
9. code cleanups
10. adequate documentation
 
If you'd like to recommend a different order, that's fine.
It might be a good idea to give the file link/unlink option
a higher priority.  I'll need your help with 4-6.

Hi...it looks to me now like it would probably be better for
Tom Layman to be doing one of your programming jobs. (Do you
still have anything left that needs to be done, or have you
finished it all?)  (pardon the gallows humor, there...)
He's been working on the database question off and on 
between fixes and finish-ups on other things, but the dbase
question/problem is too nebulous at this point for him to
handle well.  He'll be in today about 3:30 (till about mid-
night), and again probably Wed. and Thurs. (I can verify 
when on wed/thurs when he gets here today.) I would be glad
to intermediate to help things get going or whatever, but
I don't require my involvement beyond knowing generally 
what he's working on.

Currently, both the stripped+l1pp run on 64K roms; it
is just that now MPW is apparently dropping support for
the 64K roms.
The two machines that had it are the 128K and 512K, and
of course the l1pp cannot run on the 128K anyway due to
RAM limitations.
What I was worried about was CalState folks who may have
512K macs and are currently using the l1pp who could get
upset if we release 1.4 and say "you are stuck with 1.3
or the stripped down thing forever".

Dale,
Would you have time to call our professor, Ron Smith,
tomorrow (Friday) AM and, over the phone, describe to him
the way Macintosh could handle having an ethernet 
connection to NovaNET and then be able to connect to
a local network to fetch digitized images?   333-3290
 
Ron Smith is our committee chairman charged with writing
this colleges' grant proposal to the Computer Fees 
Committee, due on Feb 1st.  And Ron is our Macintosh user
who wants to use digitized images with the old PLATO
programs.  He has a few Mac II's.  No server yet. 
But in the proposal he is including ethernet cards.
Things he wants to talk about with an expert are:
        what hardware is required to connect Mac to 
                campus backbone to access NovaNET
                (using our college network I presume).
        will it be possible to have images on a network
                server that can be used by either
                a ps/2 machine or a macintosh?              and more, but I'm out of space and time.

Hi, Kurt--
sorry to have taken so long to answr your question, but it
took a while to get more info from the workstations fellow
who's trying it.  he says that when the program tries to
connect it says "waiting" and then nothing more ever
happens.  the configuration is a Zenith Z248 with WD8003
card and packet driver.  it works fine with ncsa telnet,
and the same files, card, and configuration work fine on 
an IBM, so they wonder if there's something odd about 
zeniths?  but telnet works, which adds to the puzzlement.
what can you suggest??
thanks/ brent

don't already know or know how to find out (like, I do not
know of anyway to tell simply by looking at the machine
or anything). There is some software around that would
tell them all about their machine, but all I know of is
shareware and I must assume they don't have such things
and wouldn't be able to get them given their level of
expertise. I could write a short program that would tell
this, but they couldn't get that easily either.

Hi John.  Could you provide a description of how a user in 
the field can identify the ROMs in a MAC?

Is there a simple way to find out which rom the 512 Macs
have?  A diagnostic software?

Dale,
 
What is a reasonable range in number of characters for
a DOS path for specifying C-router access to local files?
Is 80 characters a reasonable upper limit?
Can DOS paths be in upper case (which would mean
twice the number of PLATO chars).
 
I'm making up a Spud Manual that we can all sign and
give to Kurt on Thursday.
 
Also, I'll be working from home this afternoon because
the babysitter is sick again.

Another question about the DOS paths...are the
last 20 characters more likely to be unique (rather
than the first 20 chars)?

Hi Brent.
 
I've drawn a big zero on the zenith problem too.  I guess
there is one more question to ask.  Which version of
the L1PP are you using?  If not 1.6 then there is a small
chance that to problem will be fixed by 1.6. 
(1.6 does not use the metawndo tsr.)

ok; will be glad to try the 'no-x' version to see if it
helps.  thanks!  (I hope it works!  since the zeniths are
our primary public-cluster 'workstations'--about 250 of 
them--this is more or less a make-or-break question for
being able to use Plato over ethernet... and since the
async connections are coming out of the clusters, it may
mean no more plato there... bad news.)

If the release version of 1.60 does not help I think the
next step is for me to lay hands on a Z248.  I have had
success in getting machines on loan from Zenith for this
kind of purpose.  If you will forward to many any additional
details concerning the configuration of your machines I'll
start the process.

Hi there.
 
From the equipment side, all the permissions are there;
I can supply the eprom eraser; Ned/Pence approved the
terminals (on temporary loan, just like Bill Walker's
temporary loan which he had for 6 years, but officially
to be renewed yearly); Connie on 4th floor knows about it;
Pam in the business office needs to know your terminal
numbers.
 
Still looking into Roms.  Dont know about "s" records;
dont know if Mike Walker will need to be worked upon.
 
Your pay for these last few weeks is promised, no specifics
yet, tho.  Did you have a chance to tell Janice about your
improved job offer?

Dale,
If Steve Seztler is not a regular employee or a U of I
student I am not comfortable with working with him.  I
prefer working with a student or fulltime CERL staff member
on the revision of -articles-.  I am not even sure that
having Steve read this notesfile is something I am
comfortable with right now.  It sure would have been nice
if you had asked rather than told me that you were giving
someone access to this notesfile that I created.  In the
past, you did just that... That's how Dave Kibbey got on
the access list.  Why the change?
I know that the revision of both -uicat- and -articles- is
a mahor undertaking.  I think both are certainly worth
investigating if CERL is to continue to be visible in the
world of educational computing.    Like Ned I believe that
the K-12 educational environment is one that we need to give
more attention to.  I do not think we should stop serving
the university users.  Deborah

Well, you like the umpire have to call them like you see
them.  I'm glad you did.  I think it is important that the
lab as a whole come to understand how screwed up things are
and that __WE have to change things.  You are not known for
being hard to get along with (massive understatement).
When you make such a statement it has to cause people to
stop and think about the state we are in (or at least I
hope it does).  I suppose your statement could have been 
more tactful.  On the other hand, I firmly believe that
there are times that call for the unsugar coated truth
about how one feels about something.  I will certainly not
second guess you on this.
 
It might be the case that a follow up note describing
how you feel or better yet a personal visit to those who
may have taken offense to discuss the matter with them
would be of some benefit to you, them, and the Lab.
But that is a hard thing to hard.  I know from experience.

John,
 
I asked you about this some time ago and you indicated
that you were probably not interested, but now is a good
time for me ask again.  Would you have any interest in
continuing to work at CERL on a full time permanent basis?
While we do not have a position open now, I do think that
there is a good chance that one could be made if we knew
that there was a candidate with your kind of qualifications
interested.  There would have to be a search and interviews,
but I have a very high regard for your work and am sure
I am not alone in that.  I can not say that we would not
hire someone else if a better candidate appeared.  We 
would.  But from recent experience I find it hard to
imagine that we would find someone better qualified than
you.

   In dealing with the various residents for the
different terminals, it would be nice to have:
 
1. A list of all the relevant files and terminals involved.
 
2. A list of the various tools (assemblers, editors,
   etc.) and how they are typically applied.
 
3. A detailed description listing all the steps in the
   procedure for producing a new PROM (for each
   individual terminal).
 
4. Documentation of what sort of back-up files or
   procedures  are in effect (and where they are).

Add this to your list of things that need to be done.
 
Make the nameset and dataset editors able to copy from
another file with the file change or inspect code and
not just the write or read codewords.  I hate it when
one has nameset that is special coded or just uses
processor lessons and then you need to copy stuff in the
system editor and cannot because you cannont match the
write or read codes.

not. Is that ok with you? or would you like to do the Basic

He is concerned about how we will maintain these.
 
On the subject of L1PP renaming, I have the impression that
you are communicating a message beyond a new candidate name.
However, I am not certain that is the case.  Is my 
impression mistaken?

should tell me what my hjdden message might have been
In fact I was only trying to be creative in suggesting
a name that appeared to me to have more of a substantive
connection with the function of L1PP than seemed to
me to be the case for any of the live candidates that
you communicated to me.  Maybe I've simply missed their
relevance and maybe my vision of the relevance of mine
is seriously flawed.  I could easily believe either

I shared your suggestion for a new L1PP name with a number
of people who have been participting in the "name that

I'd like to that a little time at the steering committee
meeting to discuss this.  I have already spent more time
on this than I would like.  I'm amazed at the passions
aroused over such a small thing.  We have been holding 
up the release of the new version of the software
awaiting a name change.  I'd like to either select one,
decide to keep the old name or at least delay a rename
to get the next release out as soon as possible.

I myself am interested, and I am sure others are, too. I

to pick up the tab for some CERL folks, although I do not
know the details. I sent a note to Mike and asked him to
try and work those things out with you (CERL)...he will.
I know he and Ned have talked at least once, or were going

Is our group responsible for lesson "print" or is
that PSO's responsibility?  Is there anyway that

applications?  (John Hegarty was the last editor
of "print".)

* bruce / uci / nova  1/24/91  11:31 am *
Looks good. The only comment I have is on page 150, the
last paragraph, where you direct them to lesson "print".
No one has those, old, outdated printers, and usually
we have to use "epsonfx" or "jet" (which jumpout to 
"print" but  ...)  I suppose a uniform solution would be
to alter "print" to include the newer printers, I'm not
sure why we a using three lessons for this.

At this point I expect that the only changes remaining
before the release of 2.0 will be bug fixes and name
change.  If you have any outstanding changes you would
like to see in 2.0 please let me know.  I'll update the
disk on my door now.
 
//////////
 
L1pp has all the features I could possibly use at this time.
I can't think of any changes that I would recommend.
I'll  put the latest version on the PC in my office first
thing tomorrow morning.
Please remind me of which files I should copy.
Thanks.

You will need the following files from the disk on my
office door:
 
l1pplib.rtl     - basic runtime library
l1ppfull.rtl    - secondary runtime library
novao.exe       - Full featured/overlaid executable
nova.exe        - Reduced feature/nonoverlaid executable
 
Also, novaa.exe contains the experimental digitized audio
features.  It will not be distributed with 2.0.  One needs
extra hardware to use it.  It's just there for those in the
lab who want to experiment.
 
Mark Zinsow of CSO is on vacation right now.  The message
on his phone says he will be returning in early Feb.
So I plan to wait a couple more days for his return
rather than try to set something up with someone else
from CSO.

in our great el1pp-don't-work-with-Z248s saga, there's been
something of a breakthrough: they put in a newer version of
the WD packet driver and got their 1st connection, but it
had response times of ~2 minutes, they say.  They started to
wonder about ethernet interrupts when it worked perfectly on
a Zenith 3_86, so they checked the differences between the
286s and the 386.  one difference was the interrupt.  the
failing 286s had the interrupts set to 3 everywhere when
they fail(though, remember, they work w/ ncsa telnet) --when
they moved the jumper to 2 and changed the interrupt tag in
all their config files, it suddenly worked just fine!  is
there anything that would make it not work with interrupt
3??  they're hoping that they don't have to change the
jumpers in their ~200 public-cluster zeniths!  we still
haven't received the 1.6 disk yet; we'll try that to see if
it works with interrupt 3, and will let you know.  I just
learned this much this hour and wanted to update you.

while doing some routine testing of a slightly updated 
version of a package we are sending to the publisher, i
discovered a previously existing bug -- so i've been 
reworking one of the algorithms for the last few days &
haven't made a lot of additional  changes to nxnoteprt --
i don't see the re-doing of the displays as very hard but

first a question about unit startrec in block 5-g:  the 
upper bounds check is for "<zrecs" --  shouldn't this be
"<=zrecs"?
    i also found an execution error when you format a
print to a dataset or nameset (i didn't try it with kermit
so i wouldn't screw up my signon if it bombed while the disk
file was open) -- with the default option for a header on 
every page, if g.tmrg (top margin) is within 9 inclusive of
g.lpp (lines per page) then the program blows up in unit
prtnote2 on the line following the *ed out debugging -- 
variables g.line & lline are 0 or negative and you get an 
array index error -- if the first option is changed so no
page header is printed at all, then you can get g.tmrg &
g.lpp as close as 7 without blowing up but if 
(g.lpp-g.tmrg)<=6 then you get the same exec error -- there
are some checks on these interrelated variables in unit
oparrow but the checks don't address whatever is going on
here -- they just keep you from setting a top margin larger
than the page length or vice versa

(I did pnote you earlier on about some damn thing, per-

due to a "Scott must realize I'm up to my ass in alligators

Dave,
The problem leading to the failure of s0print also prevents
us from using our home-grown printing program used by our
student record and testing systems via dialup port.  (The
hardwire ports still work.)  We were first told of the
problem yesterday. I strongly suspect the problem started
with the version PLATO assembled last Friday.  If you cannot
find the problem by the end of the day, could you reassemble
PLATO using the version prior to last Friday?  Joe

The limit for the number of local variables in a
unit has been increased from 63 to 150.
 
A condensor warning of CDC incompatibility will result if
any unit uses more than 63 local variables.  This warning
may be eliminated by turning OFF the "Flag certain CERL 
extensions" option in the editing specifications section
of the lesson information display.
 
The -datain- and -dataout- commands may now read
data to and from the local variables in a unit 
(provided the record fits in the bounds of the
local variables for that unit).

Obviously, since we have never done it before it should be
removed before every other system programmer withers from
jealosy.
 
In all seriousness, I think it may set a good precedent to
add a bit of "pride of ownership" to a project, even if it
can be argued that it discriminates against those who have
(and continue) to work on less visible areas of the system.
And I had to bite my tongue to keep from making a nasty 
comment about this criticism coming from a PSOer who has
had her name plastered on the front of AIDS/ for all these
years, though in fairness they have always been very quick
(one might even imagine eager) to remove anyone who left the

Dale,
        One question that has come from the people in
our computer center (where I am going to test the tcp/ip
l1pp) is whether the software supports packet drivers. Now,
I assuming it does because you sent me all the Clarkson
stuff, is that right? Do you use it with packet drivers?
I am not sure I understand the difference, are there two
ways to do it? 1> Talking directly to the ethernet card,
and 2> using packet drivers? I am confused again! :)
        Are you going to be around tomorrow about 2:00
MST (my time)? And can I call you if we run into a snag?
Also, can you give me the two ip addresses for CERL and
Nova? Is is orpheus.cerl.uiuc.edu for CERL and vulcan.
cerl.uiuc.edu for Nova? Can you give me the actual
numbers in case our server table does not have those?
Thanks, I really appreciate the help. Next week I am
going to try it through a token-ethernet gateway that
the Business School has set up, and then in a couple of
weeks I am getting an IBM RS-6000 with both a token ring
and ether card and try using the AIX to rout.

Bill,
 
I'll recount the thoughts I had on Monday regarding testing
of new s-notes and pnotes.  Monday Scott told me that he
needed some testing of both s-notes and pnotes by people
outside the project group.  PSO and CCA came to mind as the
groups in the lab best positioned to do that.  I decided to
ask CCA rather than PSO for a couple of reasons.  First,
during the last month I have observed an increase in
hostility level between members of the system applications
section and members of the user services group.  Second,
we have experienced a rather high rate problem reports
which have been non reproducable when we are in place to
observe.  Third, there has appeared to be a considerable
lack of patience on the part of some pso staff with regard
to the rate at which we are able to address reported 
problems.  In my judgement this has taken a considerable 
toll on the morale of Scott and myself.  I think we need
a break from that.  I know I do.

shift-backed out of it.  I think the the note you got was

Basicly I think the answer is yes.  But it is a little
complicated, because users don't have control over the
names of access lists.  Those for accounts are named
'access', while those for subaccounts have the same name
as the subaccount.  Further, the question we should really
be asking is 'Use the access list that controls which
account/subaccount?', since both accounts and subaccounts
can be controlled by access lists from other accounts/
subaccounts.  This area still needs some thought.

Do we want to be able to specify access block name as well

Here's the kludge I was thinking of.  Larry and I verified
that this properly drops the TCP/IP connection in the
older distributed version of the L1PP.
 
* ldornhoff / uimatha / cerl  4/9/91  3:15 pm *
When students turn on one of my PCs, they get a master menu
of options, one of which is PLATO.  I wanted the press of a
single key to take them to the WTP signon page; and I wanted
the computer to return to the master menu when they signed
off.  (I'm using L1PP version 1.50b; haven't bothered to get
1.6.)  When they choose PLATO, the DOS command executed is
"metawndo novae -v512 -notit", so no L1PP title page is
displayed and they just see :Wait--Connection Open and then
the signon page.  In the configuration "Terminal Setup"
page, I set option "6) Return to Index on Quit" to NO and
option "7) Disconnect on Sign-Off" to YES; then a PLATO
signoff takes them back to the master batch file and my
master menu.  I hope you don't change your mind about that
being an acceptable disconnection.

Well I don't think it is picking on you Jim.  I suspect
the real conditions under which it occurs and does not
occur have not yet been correctly established.
 
Again relying on weak memory...  Three to four years ago
I made some changes to an area of the system that 
implements this.  I inadvertantly made it stop beeping.
Someone whined.  I determined that I had changed it in that
regard and restored the original beep.  I have since learned
to better separate important things from unimportant
things when there are more things to be done than I can
do.
 
I do not mean to pick on anyone in particular but I am
becoming increasingly sensitive to the custom of
making a big deal of something relativly unimportant
while we seem to hear cries from all around that we are
all overworked.  Perhaps we are in some cases just paying
attention to the wrong things.

please everyone) made the universal default notefile
when there is no file specified or the specified file
doesn't exist?  For those who don't want notes to go

important as the general move to Nova proceeds.

Hi... I can't send new notes to you because your
mailbox is full.

Thanks.
I am trying to make room in my new pnotes and meeting with
failure.
I just put a screen print and some questions about my NOVA
new pnotes, but have similar questions about CERL.  I am
trying to use new pnotes to send to others, so I can get
more comfortable with the new and weigh the advantages and
disadvantages with intelligence, information and experience.
I believe the new notes have excellent new features.  The
learning of the new notes and associated features is very
difficult compared to the other mail systems I use.
All of us need to work as a team so that the new pnotes and
gnotes keep the ease and elegance that PLATO has always been known for in the world of Educational Computing.

Yes, I was thinking in terms of total accumulated
contributions to the projects.  In fact the IBM was done
about a year before the MAC version.  When I proposed
the first set of MAC numbers they included (correctly or
incorrectly) some interactions with IBM work and royalty
divisions.  That seemed appropriate at the time but it
certainly makes more difficult the sort of reworking
I now propose.
 
* goldwasser / cerl / cerl  4/17/91  10:07 am *
Dale:  In constructing your proposed reallocation of
patent royalty payments stemming from sales of PORTAL
did you think in terms of total integrated shares of
contributions or were you thinking more in terms of 
the distribution only of current, or recent, effort?
The former should really be the basis for distribution
(I think).

xnoterun seems to be putting up a third line message
rather frequently.  Are these events also getting logged
some place so that if you are not around at the time
we still know that something happened?  If not I think
we need to get that added very soon.
--------
 
They're logged in a datafile, but not in a way which I
can spot without knowing approximately what time it
happened.  I think part of the problem is that I have been
lax about following up on some messages, so the operators
have gotten into the habit of deleting them if they stick
around for too long.
 
I should be here all day.  I'll keep close track of the

George,
I made some changes to the real naccounts, and copied
naccounts to accounts, and then reinstalled my version
of naccounts.  Now, if you enter accounts directly and
type in the name of a new style account you get a -jumpout-
to naccounts.  Tested and it seems to work.  The opposite
is also true.  If you enter naccounts directly and type the
name of an old-style account you get a -jumpout- to
accounts.
I also have to make some more changes to edit.  Entering
the name of a new-style account at the author-mode arrow
and hitting DATA works, but LAB, LAB1 and NEXT1 don't.  You
get a message about a 'non-editable file'.  I am going to
work on this today.
Yesterday I converted my first real account (cabtest) and
it worked, with one minor exception.  A bug in the convert
routine caused it to fail to destroy the subaccount nameset,
but that was easy to fix.

The lack of sign-on-record-copying capability in TUTOR is a
growing irritation over here with each multi-section course
to which we try to add for-credit PLATO work -- and has been
over the several years during which relief has been
promised.  How about if I incorporate all instances in which
we need this capability into a single lesson and you give
that lesson "temporary" system-lesson status to the extent
that it could make use of the "basic" keyword of the
-records- command?  That would take care of our problem with
a minimum of immediate effort required at your end.  (We
would, of course, be careful not to make any changes to a
basic record read from one group to be used to initialize
the new record in another group.)

Dale,
Before the next version of Portal is written on stone
(or on a distribution floppy), would you consider adding
an option?
 
Because of transfer between local and central environments,
I find that I press ESC to leave a feature rather than
SHIFT STOP.  Could you add a switch or a configuration
choice to allow ESC to be substituted for SHIFT STOP?  There
remains the question what to do about "=", which is on ESC.
Perhaps it could be placed on END, near INSERT (/)

Hi Dan,
 
I'm totally baffled by the MAC problems reported by
Monica Santana.  It really does not sound like a software
problem to me.  
 
I think some first hand observation of the events by someone
with more computer expertise than Monica is going to be
needed.  Any chance some UCI person will be visiting in
that area soon?

Hi:  I went through to the end of the unsuccessful
attempts to do that transferring from NOVA to CERL amd then some transfers of yours, Bridges and Monaca which 
been waiting went through  then my successful transfers
of some unrequested accounts started from the back end of
the alphabetical file order.....weird!. Those transfers were 
from CERL to NOVA! and they went on and on.  I think that 
means that those are just redundant transfers  and the
one that didn"t work I can straighten out in the morning.
Hope you see what I am talking about!

Re the hassles between system staff and pso staff:
 
(I'm saying this privately, since it is speculative.)
 
Have you considered that part of the problem may be our
use of electronic media for lots of discussions?  I don't
mean only the fact that it's so easy to say something in
a notesfile that someone else can take as "airing dirty
linen in public", though there's obviously that aspect.
I mean, though, the problem that has been noted long ago
that tone-of-voice doesn't come across in an electronic
note.  I suspect that a lot of the problem comes from
notes that are taken in a different way than they were
intended by the writer.  (In fact, I'm sitting here
wondering how this note will read to you.  I'm trying
to use a neutral "tone of voice", but of course you
may not be able to sense that.)  Anyway, this is just
a bit of food for thought...which you may have already
thought of.

        I came in to work to "finalize" the Portal counts
last Sunday, and delegated the voucher-preparation to Dona
(Nancy being on vacation last week) on Monday morning.
        However, they did not physically leave here until
this afternoon.  I was disappointed, myself, but there are
extenuations.
        The dollar amounts are disappointing.  The excerpt
below is one way that I'm reacting to that.

and copying them early Monday morning, and you should see
yours by noon.                  Bill
[copy of note to m smith/uci/nova]
[....]
        Since then, I've come up with a second inquiry,
though.  In toting up the sales of Portal for royalty
purposes, I noticed that it's been at least six months since
any of the UCI outfits (except, I think, Racine) has
licensed any copies of it.   Who should I talk to about
this?                           Bill

        Subacct "ssc" in account "adial" on cerl has been
expanded by two parts to reflect the conversion of "sscnote"
--I'm notifying Kurt Hebel (kurt/musician).  This will
come over to Nova as part of the overally conversion.
 
        Please transfer (or cause to be transferred)
notefile "alchemy" on Nova, from whatever account it is
in (probably the linked-files account) to "adial".
        On the cerl system, it is in account "adial",
subacct "rogers" (Brian L. Rogers).  It is linked between
systems, which I think is why it got to be in some other
account.

Dale:  The last thing I want to do is to spoil the 
weekend when the switch is to be thrown from old notes
to nunotes, and I don't intend to do so.  I'm sure that 
Saturday will go smoothly and relatively painlessly, and
although I don't expect the system to be overwhelmed with
"bravos",  I hope we'll all be pleasantly surprised.
     At the same time, as I indicated previously, I don't
 expect (and will not allow) the PSO_SYSTEMS meeting to
become quarrelsome, cantankerous, abrasive or hostile. 
There is no reason for you to view it with foreboding, and
it is a fact that although you and your group may be the
current lightning rod, the fundamental problem i_s_ a PSO_
( whole_SYSTEMS ) problem.  David Frye will be gone the rest
of this week, so I'd prefer to "stay the course". That also
avoids the risk that suddenly imbuing the meeting with some
apparent and somewhat mysterious urgency might  decrease, to
some extent, its probability for success.  SO _______  I'd
prefer to leave the schedule as it's been set.

Mike,
 
I have a possible recruit for the joint pso/system staff
position (if that one comes to pass).  Recent BS in
Engineering Psychology.  Has a PLATO/TUTOR background.
Some experience with programming micros.  A lot of
PC application use experience.  Not sure how much LAN
background he has.
 
He is currently in charge of the support services of a
micro software producer.  He may be looking for a change
but is not sure yet.
 
Like me he is not incline to put up with a lot of 
nonsense.  If I understand correctly it's the nonsense
level where he is now that is causing him to consider
a change soon.  I told him of the "potential postition"
and he said he might have some interest.  Professional
growth is high on his list of priorities.

Hey!
 
        Got one little problem with the spud/whatever --
how can I get it to send 8 bit/no parity/1stop bit for 
the serial connection, on both the ibm and the mac?  Got
this network that needs to be worked through ( you guessed
it ) -- and basically it would work if the "next" actually 
handled the 8bit no parity -- this should't be a problem
because I think the lau strips it all off.

From the look of the notes you forwarded from "noteshn",
we (PSO) did in fact have much what John has suggested in
mind.  There seems to be an awful lot of left hand not 
knowing what the right hand is doing going on.  Unless
PSO is included fully as a party in the development of
the new notes system, I feel that it is impossible for
us to participate at all, including subsequent consultation
with users upon its release.

Re. that micro-in-nameset problem John Gilpin reported:
He sent me the following note.  I have saved files rus1bbad,
-disp, and -good in account hgfa on cerl for when you get
time to look into the problem.  As you can see, John has
found something that seems to be reproducible.
hgfpnotes / cerl  6/5/91  4:25 pm  gilpin / cca / cerl
After repairing "rus1b/cerl" so I could go on using it,
I made another copy "rus1bdisp/cerl", went into its
microtable, and again changed the meaning of SPACE to
NEXT, and it did trash it again.  So the error is
definitely repeatable.
 
Along with "rus1bbad/cerl", feel free to take "rus1bdisp/
cerl", and also "rus1bgood/cerl", which I just created to
save you the trouble of dealing with both systems.

Dale:  A bit more on John Gilpin's subfile-in-nameset
problem, for your collected notes on it, and then I'm
going to be quiet about it.
I did some experimenting with copies of rus1bgood.  Using
modify, I discovered that the damaged copy has the actual
disk block ok; but an attempt to access it using nameset
subfile machinery gets a copy of sector (block) 0!  So
presumably the RAT or something is messed up.
I also found a workaround:  Make a copy of microtable in a
lesson file, edit it there, copy it back to nameset.
Talked to John Gilpin by phone.  He is aware of workarounds,
so is ok in short term, but needs fix before his package can
be released.  I told him someone would get to it, but

Ned,
 
I just spoke with Mike Behar.  He spent yesterday in
NYC on the NCY school system thing.  He also has been
in touch with Motorola and believes that they, UCI and
CERL have some mutual interest in local execution/
central managment and distribution.  He asked me to 
attend a brainstorming session with them in Chicago
6/26, the day after the UCI meeting here.  I asked him
to get in touch with you and fill you in directly on
what he is thinking about.  I told him that I would be
able to go on that date.

By all means go.  Sounds interesting.     Ned

Hi,
 
Please take a look at the HELP while setting automatic
cleanup parameters on a file using nxnotes.  Press HELP
while on the fill in the form page.  Let us know what you

I can't get into nxnotes.  In any case, I'm a bit uncertain
about the nature of the request, whether it's to me 
personally or to me in my capacity as one of the consul-
tants.  I'd feel more comfortable waiting until Ned
has clarified the question of consultants' obligations
regarding review of system utilities.

I'm sort of looking around for a part-time job.  Money would
be nice, but that's not the major intent; access to
resources are often possible with an association with an
organization.
 
I'm just wondering if there would be any possibility for
some sort of testing position or something where I could
work from home.  I've invested a lot of money in a nice
computer system at home, and I'd like to use it, and maybe
help finance it.  It is a 25 mhz 386 clone, DTK motherboard,
VGA, 40 meg 251-1 MFM hard drive, 340 meg SCSI hard drive,
QIC-80 Tape drive (uses DC2080 and DC2120 cartridges), 4
megabytes of RAM, MSDOS 5.0, Practical Peripherals 9600SA
V.32/V.42/V.42bis modem.  I also have a Cyrix 25mhz coproc.
 
There are a number of things I'm interested in.  Currently,
the major thing I do with my machine is run a Fidonet Point.
I can elaborate on this more if you like.  I'm interested
in running a bulletin board someday, but I need even more
resources to do it properly by my definition.

Hi -- I sent this to GDF; thought you might want to know.
 
This is not a complaint; it is more of a FYI note...
 
For the last few months I have been trying to get our
laser printing to work via NovaNET communications.  I
have had lots of problems.  John Hegarty has been
helpful, and I am sure he will continue to help.
 
In general, there are problems with the Appletalk
connection to PLATO.  Monica says she gets disconnected
a couple of times per day; we do not see that sort of
problem; the only problems we see seem to occur only
when large amounts of data are being transmitted (ie,
when I try to laser print).  It has been hard to figure
out when problems are due to "the network" and when they
are due to problems in the Portal or the Mac's Printer
Access Protocol.  Will give you some solid info if we
ever get any...

Oh, I forgot to say:
 
A major part of John's work has been to try to get
around the problems with tcp as it is used with NovaNET:
Because of problems with some of he old Level 0 protocol
programs, flow control has to be off for tcp.  This means
the John needs to generate XOFF and XON himself in the
MacPortal; that would be automatic if tcp flow control
were active, and, because of the way the MultiFinder
works on the Mac, it is not especially easy to implement
for John.  It should be close to working now, tcp
problems together  with the yucky macintosh interface
to the laser printer make going slow...

Paul,
 
I have a work around added the the ALT-U problem that
should help if the terminal has enough memory and it has
not become "fragmented".
 
ALT-U works by saving a copy of the output that comes
from NovaNET and then replaying it into an offscreen
full size bitmap which is then printed.  That buffer was
a MAX of 32K long.  My guess is that the large display
you were building contained more than 32K bytes of output
(about 2 min 10 sec at 2400 baud).  I have changed the
page saver so that you can configure it for up to 64K
of output.  I'll send you a copy if you need it before
the next release.

Right now you would have to output the notes to a nameset
or dataset and then ask that to be printed.
 
On the nova system, which will be our only production
system soon, we have no central printing at all, yet.
That is being reviewed now.  However, with more and more 
of our users existing at great distances from CERL and
the cost of printers dropping so low, we decided to make
local printing our first priority.

David:  I, like you, was surprised and dismayed by the fact
that Jim brought more heat than light to our meeting 
yesterday.  On the other hand, I was pleased by what I 
perceived to be a softening of his attitude as the
proceedings progressed. I think it must have stood out
like a sore thumb, even to Jim himself, that everyone
but him was behaving calmly and rationally. 
    No, I don't think it was anything you said that 
triggered the initial outburst.  In any case, I did
think that thje meeting ended constructively, And I
have hopes that thoings will now improve, albeit very
slowly, I am sure.But don' let my expectations run away
with you. It will take some effort on everyone's part, but
I am sure that it will be well worth the effort if we
succeed in bringing everyone together in a common effort to
achieve our common goals.  In spite of the shortcomings of
PSO or of any other group, we need all of the help that
is available to do what we want to do and to do so on
the schedule we have set for ourselves.

Hi Dale:  The terminal has 1 meg of memory so there should

of RAM left when I shell out and it shows over 512K  free
so it shouldn't be too fragmented.  Normally, I don't do
that much screen printing but we are revising a whole

few screen prints for proofing changes, etc.  If the

        How's it going?  I talked to celia on wednesday --
she isn't exactly the most thrilled person...  Oh well..
I can't believe that certain people are finally having
their contracts there ended ( or whatever the proper wording
is.. )
 
        Anyway -- we've spent the last week packing up
the entire office to move from DC to the AT&T facility
out here ( only 5 months after we were told it would
happen..)  Changing a 1 hour commute ( each direction )
to a 10 minute commute..  Gotta love that..
 
Oh yeah, got an interesting PC (eisa) card to play with.
It is a smart little thing that controls 128 serial 
ports, each up to 38.4 kb..  And you can stick 2 or 3
of these cards in a single machine..  Pretty impressive.

Umm, how odd.  This happened because a flag in the
accounts common was changed from 1 to 2, by some
process that eludes me, but this is the second time it
has happened.  I changed the flag back to 1, thus
unreleasing mailfiles.  I will look around for the bug,
but for now I don't think there is a need for any public
annoucement.  It is possible that some users created
mailfiles, but Scott doesn't think there is anyway they
can use them.  However if PSO people get questions about
this I suggest you just say it happened by mistake (and
maybe ask the user to delete the file).
 
Sorry for the inconvience.

   I have added an option related to the handling of lesson
notes in response to a need expressed by the cca group.
I'm looking for suggestions regarding the wording.
   The problem is to have a processor lesson use the
notesfile of the file it is processing rather than its
own.  To allow this without changing any current behavior
of the system, a flag has been added to the directory
of lessons that can be set in the "Associated files"
section.  Thus the author of the processor lesson has
to take explicit action to allow this to occur.
   But the question remains, exactly what is this?
Terms like override, redirect, and divert are some
that seem to suggest the action.
   Currently the display (available in nedit1) says:
"Allow override -----" followed by YES or NO,
and the help says:
   "Allowing the override of the notesfile applies
only when the lesson has been entered as a
processor for another file.  When allowed, the
notesfile of that file will then be used."

   A couple further thoughts and pieces of information:
This really doesn't force redirection, it does just allow
it.  If the processed file does not have a notesfile
specified, the notesfile defaults back to that of the
processor lesson.  And I worry somewhat about using
processor and processed file in the same sentence/train
of thought (though I just did it above).  I am sort
of afraid of the "average" user getting confused by
processor and processee.  I am more inclined to use
the root word "process" in reference to just one of
the two files involved if possible.  Maybe I'm just
worrying about non-existent problems--that's why I
appreciate input.  I'll be happy to change things
any way that people agree will clarify what's involved.

Also under discussion (in another string here in psonotes)
is the need to be able to specify someplace other than
lnotes that a lesson's TERM-comments should go to when
its own comment file is full.  Let's think of a wording
that won't make it harder to describe this additional
feature that might be implemented.  Al's suggestion of
"redirect" is good; something like "overflow file" for
the second cabability would be descriptive.
 
Should these two things be implemented at the same time?

Seems to me that for the case of a full notesfile one
would want to have the target notesfile specify where
overflow comments should go rather than the lesson.
 
The choice of lesson notesfile to use might look like
this:
 
file = lesson notes file
if   zxfile  && comment redirection on  && !,lesson tag
     file = comment file for zxfile (if nonzero)
if file full
     file = overflow_file(file)
if   file full
     file = 'lnotes'
if   file full
     tell user & drop note
 
(This basically adds the second if to the current setup)

that one additional refinement that some would find 
desirable would be to allow "NONE" as a choice for a

   I've been planning to add a pause when the specified file
is full and put out a message like:
 
"File full.  NEXT to use system overflow file; BACK to exit"
 
(guess that fits on one line).  This would at least
provide some feedback on what's happening currently and
can be done immediately with almost no effort.
 
   As for refinements, it would be straight-forward to add
another bit to the lesson directory as a permission bit to
use the system overflow file (or maybe, since that is the
current option, it would be a "discard overflow notes"
flag).  But I'm afraid it may not be so easy to find
a full word in the lesson directory to hold a file
name to use for overflow.

Michael has asked that we proceed with implmenting an
option in a notesfile for specifying an "overflow file for
TERM-comments and -notes-".
 
There would be three possible settings:
 
default - blank - (displays "lnotes") overflow to lnotes
filename - overflow to filename
NONE - overflow to bit bucket
 
We would only support one level of overflow.  So if an
overflow file was full we would not roll over to its
overflow but rather to "lnotes" unless NONE is specified
as on the second file.  We do not want to get into a
long (potentially infinite) chain of files.
 
Where to put this option in the notefile directory editor?
I think the most likely place is with "Make room for more
notes".  Other ideas on where it could go?

I agree that it will look lonesome on the file parameter
display.  Could access to a separate display be provided
instead?  The same separate display could be accessed both
from the parameter and too-many-notes indexes.
 
My concern is that it would be missed at setup time if
not included with the parameters, and missed at near-
overflow time if not included with the archive/delete
options.  With several thousand notesfiles on the
system, the latter case may be the most frequent for
a loooong time.

There was a fairly long discussion of that in here around

psonotes / nova  11/20/91  5:00 pm  celia / pso / nova
...............................  Let's think of a wording
that won't make it harder to describe this additional
feature that might be implemented.  Al's suggestion of
"redirect" is good; something like "overflow file" for
the second cabability would be descriptive.
/////
Let's call it "overflow file" and in the HELP describe it
as the "file where TERM-comments are to be sent if this
file fills up", and give three choices: one designated by
the user, System Default File "lnotes", and NONE.
/////
 
psonotes / nova  11/21/91  11:02 am  blomme / s / nova
   I've been planning to add a pause when the specified file
is full and put out a message like:
 
"File full.  NEXT to use system overflow file; BACK to exit"
 
(guess that fits on one line).  This would at least
psonotes / nova  11/21/91  4:08 pm  celia / pso / nova
That sounds fine, Rick.  I'd change it just slightly:
 
"Comment file full. NEXT to use overflow file; BACK to exit"
/////
There was concern expressed that such a message would
"frighten" the users, but there was no evidence in support
of that, and I think the consultants' experience is that
it's always better to tell the users something than to
hide from them the fact that something is going on.
 
In the last response in the previous string, Al brought up
points about the location of the option; I think those 
should be given careful consideration.

Seems to me that for the case of a full notesfile one
would want to have the target notesfile specify where
overflow comments should go rather than the lesson.
 
The choice of lesson notesfile to use might look like
this:
 
file = lesson notes file
if   zxfile  && comment redirection on  && !,lesson tag
     file = comment file for zxfile (if nonzero)
if file full
     file = overflow_file(file)
if   file full
     file = 'lnotes'
if   file full
     tell user & drop note
 
(This basically adds the second if to the current setup)
psonotes / nova  11/21/91  9:27 am  walker / s / nova
That looks like a reasonable appoach to me Dale.  I assume
that one additional refinement that some would find 
desirable would be to allow "NONE" as a choice for a
forwarding file.  
psonotes / nova  11/21/91  9:50 am  sinder / s / nova
For sure.
psonotes / nova  11/21/91  10:09 am  jmk / pso / nova
I agree that "NONE" is an essential alternative, as
the original comment notefile and the comment file's
overflow file.

Do you have any interest in buying Think C 5.0 (for the
applications group perhaps)?  John Hegarty seems to think
that it might be worth getting.
 
Students and staff can buy it for $85+tax/etc (much less
than the mail order price of $199), and there's a 10-pack
for $550.  Not sure that the 10-pack includes 10 sets of
disks/manuals; this is being looked into.  I'm trying to see
whether there's enough interest.

Hi!
I just downloaded Portal ver 2.1+ for the PC in order to 
use the full-screen editor.   I am right now using the 
standard editor (mind, I have tried this while sending  a
pnote to myself) and am not sure when the full screen editor
can be accessed.  If I press BACK  to end insert mode,
then shift-DATA will produce the old friendly editor,
but this does not seem to be the new full screen editor...
Can you help?
Incidentally, the setup.exe program is sweet!!! I have
never seen more attention to detail, reminding the user
of what will happen. (whoever did the design) should get
a pat on the back, it is a fine utility for a user who
may not know what is going on!!! Cheers, Bryan

RE:

pbnotes / nova  2/19/92  10:22 am  ken kling / usg / nova
Is there any way to tell if someone has read (viewed) a
p-note that you have sent them?
 
***
        Since the notestring is getting somewhat carried
away, I will add my 2 cents privately.  We do get a lot of
requests for this.  Most BBS's have a send\receive option.
It is like the "not yet read" notation in student notes 
files so the instructor can see if the student has read
the note.  Here, however, we are dealing with pnotes, which
is a different story.  Taking aside for the moment  the
issue of privacy, what is desired is the following. Sender
selects the "receive/notice" option and a bit is set so
indicating.  When the receiver looks at the note, the bit
is detected and a message is generated and sent back to
the sender:
 
Message to "name/group", "date" , "title" has been received.
with a title to the sender of "Notice: Message Received".
 
The bit is then 0ed so that if he reads the note again, 
another message is not sent.
 
I may be all wet, but this this might be technically
doable.
 
Now as to whether this should be allowed from a
privacy standpoint???? I guess, personally, having
accepted this notion in a BBS, I don't find it offensive and
have gotten used to it.   I can accept the fact that a note
has been received but not responded to.  At least I know:
1.  I pressed shift next instead of shift stop to send it.
2.  That when I get an "I am away" message, when the note
was received.
3. That I don't need to send it again.
4. That i might wait a week before following up.
 
At first glance I suppose one might feel his privacy has
been violated.  But in this technological medium I think
there is already a presumption that a message sent has been
received, and this kind of system can so easily confirm
the obvious to aleviate our fears of "Did I or the system
goof," and eliminates at least some frustrations.

Got a copy of Sam Milosevich's post re the CERL Macintosh programmer
opening, and have spread it around a bit here at CMU.   
 
How are things going these days?    Does CERL have a new director yet?
 
If you have a new director, has he defined a new agenda? 
 
 
Me, I'm still trying to get cT 2.0 out the door and have been holding
off on advertising for a new programmer till that is done.  Soon - the
books are already being printed, and I'm getting fewer and fewer problem
reports.
 
With the obvious things to do on cT, and the multimedia group, I'm in
for a busy year - would be nice to work in a Yukon trip tho!  (my
vacation record last year was absolutely awfull - only one short camping
trip all year).
 
 
Problems with 3C505                             Note 342 - 9 responses

Is there some trick to getting 3Com EtherLinkPlus cards (3C505)
to work with packet drivers and the BYU/Intel IPX shells?
 
The cards work fine with the packet driver and the CUTCP package.
They also work fine with an IPX.COM which directly drives the card.
However when attempting to use a packet driver shell to talk to a
Novell file server (NW3.1) it frequently has trouble locating the
file server, and if it does, then it works *very* slowly.
 
I've checked that everything is ECONFIGed appropriately.  After all
it does work occasionally.
 
We also have WD8003E cards in-house which work flawlessly.
 
A comment in the BUGS.DOC file in release 9 of the packet drivers
indicates that other people have also experienced problems since
version 7.  I tried going back to version 6, but that didn't help.
 
Any tips would be appreciated.

----BETA test of 10.x release

* nelson@crynwr.com  1/21/92  11:16 am *
The 10.x packet drivers are on asylum.sf.ca.us for anonymous ftp, in
beta-packet-drivers.  There are three files, drivers.zip,
drivers1.zip, and drivers2.zip.  The first one contains executables
and documentation.  The other two contain sources.
 
To the best of my knowledge, these drivers work.  I have not made any
"dangerous" changes since the 9.x release.  HOWEVER, please treat
them as a beta release until we've gotten some reports that they
work.  I haven't announced these anywhere else -- I want to hear from
you before I do.
 
Of special interest are PKTTRAF.COM, a graphical display of network
traffic, and WINPKT.COM, a shim to make packet drivers work with
Windows 3.0 Enhanced mode.
 
The DEPCA driver works on the revision E DEPCA and DE-100 that I
have.  I haven't tried it on a DE-200, but I used the most general
possible algorithm.
 
The SLIP8250 driver now transmits using a busy-wait loop, which
should be more reliable than the old interrupt method.  If it proves
to be unacceptably slow, I have some improvements to the interrupt
method that may work.
 
Still no Everex or UB-NIU or EXOS 205T packet drivers.
 
Still doesn't work on some WD Elite-16 boards.

Hmmm...  I'll bet that *none* of them implement it properly.  The
proper solution is to add it to f_reset_interface in head.asm. I'll
add it to the 11.x release.  That will happen as soon as I get

I have heard lots of rumors about problems with the latest Western Digital

months, but the release 8 WD8003e driver has worked with all the 8 and 16

Some people have trouble with the Elite 16 board && the Crynwr
wd8003e.com driver.  I recently received a donated board from SMC,
and it works fine on my machines.  I haven't yet determined the
common factor for the failures.  Someone suggested that it might be
using or not using the soft configuration.

    We also have a few Intel PCLINK2 ethernet cards which we would
   like to use. We haven't found that card in the list for which packet driver
   were written (like 3c501, WDxxxxx, NIxxxx etc). I was wondering whether
   such driver exists which will allows our PCs having PCLINK cards to get
   onto network using the facilities that NIxxxx enjoys. 
 
You're the second person to ask for one recently.  Supposedly, they've written
one.  It's been a few years since I contacted the people at Intel who may
have done it.  I'll give them a call and ask...

Russ:
This is not really a bug, but it does need some one's attention.
 
1. Last version of IBMTOKEN.COM (DRIVERS.ZIP,/pub/ka9q@sun.soe.clarkson.edu)
   is missing the major(?) version number. (I think the same sort of thing
   happend with an earlier version.)
   It displays the following at start up time:
 
   Token Ring Driver (3C501 emulation) Version : .E
                                                |
                                             Missing version here.
 
2. The documentation needs to be updated to reflect the changes made in this
   case ESP because until this version, Brian Fisher's note (included in
   IBMTOKEN.NOT) categorically states "IBMTOKEN won't run with PC LAN."
   However, if you run IBMTOKEN.COM version (.E),you see the following message:
 
   Token Ring Driver (3C501 emulation) Version : .E
   portions -
 
   [... Lines deleted...]
 
   Modified to run with MS LAN Manager/IBM LAN
   Support Program by Antero Koskinen
 
Since the .COM file is dated later than the .NOT file, I'm assuming that
the .COM file has the correct information. A line in IBMTOKEN.NOT might
alleviate  the confusion.
 
Please take these to be a suggestions rather than criticisms. All of us here
are *greatly* appreciative of the Packet Driver collection and the people
responsible for creating and maintaining them.

Hi Dale:   Since you've been thinking about providing TUTOR commands to
make a local screen editor available to authors, I thought I'd pass
along a description of ours (as it is for this release). 
 
Enclosed is the description of the -edit- command from the cT 2.0 reference.
 
The text may be slightly munged (tabs incorrect, for example) as I
transfered it from Word to Unix.
 
All of the edit and related functions depend heavily on cT "marker"
variables - these are described in the cT 1.1 manuals (which you should
have a copy of, someplace).     
 
In some sense, this is what marker variables were originally designed
for: handling active, complex text under program and user control - note
that a change to a marker variable that covers part of the text of an
edit panel can cause the edit panel to automatically update what is
displayed on the screen.
 
---------------------------------
 
The =edit= command displays editable text that the user can manipulate
(scroll through the text, copy parts of the text, etc.).  Before an =edit=
command may be used a corresponding edit variable must be defined.  This
variable identifies the edit panel in subsequent commands:
 
define  edit: myedit
 
Like file variables, edit variables can be passed by address to subroutines.
 Two edit variables can be compared with "=" or "~=".
 
The form of the =edit= command is:
 
edit    variable; rectangle; unit; text; keyword; keyword; ...
 
edit    myedit; 35,135; 120,235; DoHot; m1; vscroll; editable
 
The "rectangle" defines the area of the screen containing the text panel,
the specified unit is associated with "hot text" (discussed below), and
"text" is the string to be displayed in the edit panel.  There are also
=redit= and =gedit= commands which use relative or graphing coordinates.
 
If no unit for treating "hot text" is associated with the edit panel,
the unit name must be given as x:
 
edit    myedit; 10,20; 150,60; x; "Click Here"
 
When an edit panel is active, the system variable zedit is set to be equivalent
to the corresponding edit variable.
 
The keywords which specify an edit panel's basic properties are:
 
hscroll edit panel should have a horizontal scroll bar
vscroll edit panel should have a vertical scroll bar
editable    text in the panel may be altered by the user
frame   draws a box around the edit panel (normally TRUE)
erase   edit panel should be erased when destroyed
visible specify portion of text to be visible in the panel;
      e.g., visible,m1
select  specify portion of text to be selected; e.g., select,m2
 
Any of the keywords other than visible and select can be accompanied by
an expression that is TRUE or FALSE, to enable or disable that feature.
 For example, in the following =edit= command the frame option will be
deactivated:
 
edit    myedit; 10,20; 150,60; x; "Click Here"; frame, FALSE
 
For the visible and select options, you specify a marker on the text displayed
in the edit panel.  The select option scrolls the text so that the selected
region is visible in the edit panel, and if the edit panel is in focus
(see the =focus= command) the selected text is highlighted.  For the visible
option, the first line showing in the edit panel will be the line that
contains the start of the associated marker.  Here is an example of an
=edit= command that uses the visible option to make the last line of the
text be visible in the edit panel:
 
edit    myedit; 10,20; 150,60; x; m1; visible,zlast(m1)
 
You can change any property of an existing edit panel with a "reset" version
of the =edit= command, as in the following example:
 
edit    reset, me; select, marker12  $$ change selected text
 
Changing the actual displayed text does not require using the "reset"
option.  Whenever you make a change in the edit panel's marker (by using
=replace, =append=, or =style=), the edit panel notices this and updates
its display accordingly.  If however you use =calc= or =string= to place
the original marker around new text, the marker is no longer associated
with the edit panel, and you can no longer affect the text displayed in
the edit panel by executing =replace, =append=, or =style= on the original
marker.
 
An edit object may be destroyed by an =edit= command with no keywords:
 
edit    myedit   
 
Edit panels are also destroyed by =jump=, a new main unit, or when a local
edit variable becomes invalid upon leaving a subroutine.  If the edit
panel was created with the "erase" keyword, the edit panel is automatically
erased when it is destroyed, and that area of the screen is cleared to
the window color that was in effect at the time the edit panel was created.
 If the "erase" keyword is not used, an edit panel is not erased when
it is destroyed (but it stops accepting inputs).
 
There is only one keyset but there can be several edit panels active on
the screen.  Which edit panel receives the keyset information can be switched
by the user clicking in another panel, or by the program executing a =focus=
command.  If no edit panel has been selected for input, keyset inputs
go to a =pause= or =arrow= command.  Often it is appropriate to execute
=focus  myedit= right after the =edit= command, to make sure that the
edit panel is already selected for input.
 
When a specified hot-text unit begins executing, cT does not process any
other =button=, =slider=, and =edit= events until the end of that unit
is reached, or until there is a =pause=, =getkey=, =arrow=, or =jump=
command.  This blocking of other display objects prevents possible confusion
from a second event interrupting the unit and do-ing the same unit, although
such duplication can occur if you have a =pause=, =getkey=, =arrow=, or
=jump= command in the do-ne unit.  You may need to set and check a global
variable to guard against duplication.  Note also that =menu= events can
take place during the processing of =button=, =slider=, and =edit= events.
 
The "zeditsel()" function returns a marker on the current text selected
by dragging the mouse:  for example, zeditsel(myedit) or zeditsel(zedit).
 
The "zeditvis()" function returns a marker on the text currently visible
within an edit panel:  for example, zeditvis(myedit) or zeditvis(zedit).
 
The "zedittext()" function returns a marker on the entire text associated
with an edit panel:  for example, zedittext(myedit) or zedittext(zedit).
 
A powerful feature of edit panels is "hot text."  It is possible to specify
that a word or phrase appearing in an edit panel is "hot text," and when
a user double-clicks on that word or phrase the unit specified in the
=edit= command is do-ne.  This makes it possible to link together text,
diagrams, and even videodisc segments as an interconnected "hypertext."
 
To make a word or phrase be hot text, select the text in the program (typically
in a =string= or =calc= command), just as though you were going to make
that text be italic or bold.  Then choose "Hot" from the Styles menu.
 You will be prompted to type a string to be associated with this hot
text.  If the text is displayed with an =edit= command, the hot unit will
be do=ne whenever the user double-clicks on the hot text.  A hot style
and associated string can also be created with a =style= command.
 
The system function zhotinfo(myedit) gives a marker on the string associated
with the hot text, and the system function zhotsel(myedit) gives a marker
on the hot text itself.  Note that zeditsel(myedit) typically brackets
just one word of the hot text that was double-clicked on.
 
You cannot store into a region specified by zeditsel(editvar),
zeditvis(editvar),
zedittext(editvar), or zhotinfo(editvar).  If you want to change such
a region, first use one of these functions to obtain a marker variable
bracketing the region:
 
calc    m := zeditsel(zedit)
replace m, "hello"
 
If not all of an edit panel would be visible due to part of the panel
being off screen or clipped, the panel is not created, and zreturn is
set to 2.  Once an edit panel has been successfully created, it is unaffected
by later =clip= commands:  clicking on an edit panel temporarily removes
the clip in order to manipulate the text.
 
If an edit-panel object can be created successfully, the system variable
zreturn is set to TRUE (-1).  If it cannot be created due to lack of computer
memory, zreturn is set to 1.  An attempt to reset the value of an inactive
edit panel sets zreturn to 3.
 
Example:
 
unit    xEditText
    edit: Gettysburg
    m: Gtext

Here is a basic file editor which uses the =edit= command and file commands
to create, inspect, or modify styled text files.  You can easily add more
features to this file editor.  When editing a file you can apply bold
and italic styles, and you could easily add more style options.  On a
Macintosh you can even paste in an image taken from the Scrapbook or another
application.  One useful change would be to fix up the editor to open
several files at the same time, so you can copy and paste between two
files.
 
An existing file may contain several sections of styled text if the file
was generated by several =dataout=s of markers.  This file editor keeps
track of such sections by wrapping a marker around each of them, and when
you save the file it writes the sections out one at a time so as to preserve
the original structure of the file.  
 
* The =define= must be in the IEU (initial entry unit),
*   before the first =unit= command:
define  group,files:
    file: fd    $$ the file that is read and written
    m: text $$ the full text of the file
    i: NSECTIONS=100   $$ allow up to 100 text sections
    i: ns   $$ number of text sections found in the file
    m: section(NSECTIONS)   $$ sections of base text

I have uploaded the latest version of Mac Portal (v 2.20, dated Jan 17,1992)
onto ux1 in /tmp.
It is saved under portal.sit.hqx and is binhexed and stuffit'd.
It's about 150k.
 
Could you place a copy in the /pub/mac directory?

I had a 'mailbox almost full' message.
People were not able to send notes to me due to
'mailbox full' for a week.
lamaster/uasite extended my mailbox to solve the problem
at the request of jmk/pso, and sent me a note telling me
about it.

I'm getting a little frustrated by this problem.
"Mailbox almost full" means exactly what it says.  There
is room for at least 1 more (short) note.  Longer notes
may not fit.  "Mailbox full" also means what it says.

The fact that users keep on misunderstanding it suggests
that perhaps it isn't as clear to them as it is to our
staff.
 
How about this:  if there's not enough room for a 20-line
note, say "Mailbox Full".  Even though that may be slightly
inacurrate in some cases, it's inaccurate in the direction
that makes it easier for the user to cope, rather than
inaccurate in the other direction.

Right...I guess the only straigtforward solution is to
have an additional message for note senders: That person's
mailbox doesn't have enough room for a note of that length,
but if you try a shorter one (quickly), it might fit.  Or
not.

Send as much of the note as possible.  That will force
the "mailbox full" message.  Tell the sender that
"Your note was trucated because there wasn't enough space
in the receivers mailbox for the entire note".

I hope not.  Some notes can be seriously misinterpreted if
truncated.  Forcing the 'File Full' message if anyone ever
tries to send a note that will not fit would be my choice.
(Requires File Full to be a sticky bit instead of 
calculated.  Is that a problem?)

The length of the note that one can send must be awfully
short, because I couldn't send him a one-liner.  It would
seem to me that if all there's room for is a note with
no content, then for all practical purposes, the file is
full.

I think it should say "almost full" if there is enough
room for at least one minimum size base note, "full"
otherwise. Even in the "full" case, you might still
be able to append a response to an already existent
string, but I don't think there's anything that can
be done about it.
 
I think this is how it was designed to work...?

The problem is there is really no way to say what a
minimum-sized note will be.  For instance, a one-line
note sent to a mailing list takes up a lot more room than
a one-line note sent to an individual.

Why would a person not delete notes when informed repeatedly
that her file was almost full?
 
James had the best suggestion that I have heard -- if notes
have been returned because one's mailbox is full (or almost
full), a flag should be set and the user informed of this
fact.  If that doesn't wake her up, I guess nothing will.

Yes, that would be good, especially if it says that
deleting notes will make room for more.  We know that,
but there's no reason an ordinary teacher would know
that, especially if all the management of her files is
done by someone else, as in this case.  When her data
files get full, for example, she need not do anything;
her "wizard" (sic) takes care of that.  There's no reason
for her to suspect that her pnotes are different.
