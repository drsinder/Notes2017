It would be nice if the octal entry mode on the character
design page let you type 0017777$cls$N so you could shift
your character up N dots. Trivial but kind of kinky, eh?
How about a more general "reposition-a-character" option?

indeed, in the generating of some kinds of displays, the
ability to attach a fine grid address or offset to a char
would save much trouble and space. rd

---------- note 1 charsets
  08/22     13.47     celia       pso

At present the PLATO character set library resides in
lessons "charsets" and "charsett". We will soon be moving
these charsets to a new, single lesson, "charsetx".
Some of the charsets will be renamed, and a few will be
revised. Charsets "nsf" and "monch" will be deleted,
unless I hear from someone that they are in use. If you
are using either one, let me know right away!

The new names of the renamed charsets are in the first
reply to this note. The old lessons and names will exist
concurrently with the new ones for two weeeks. If this
inconveniences anyone, please let me know.

Many lessons on Plato were written by authors who are
no longer on the system to update their lessons. Someone
in each curriculum group may or may not X-search their
lessons for these charsets. Some lessons will probably be
missed...

Could the system make a search of all lessons for these
charsets (and either make the appropriate changes or at
least list all lessons that need changing)? Perhaps this
could be done during the next lesson conversion....

     I believe that there was once a course listed in the ?timetable (i think it was listed as cs 109) for persons
interested in learning the tutor language. It seems that this is no longer the case. Is there a course available, a
nd if so, what is it listed as?

   Within the last three weeks there was a note from
Dr. Friedman (friedman - csa) on this. The gist was that
course numbers had been changed on many of their courses,
including cs109. Sorry, I don't remember what it was
changed to.

   You could search the general and help notes for his
note, or send him a pnote. (Presuming on one else with
the exact information replies to this note.)

---------- response 2

The new course number is CS ¬=196.

---------- response 3
  08/25     09.56     friedman       csa

CS 109 is indeed now known as CS 196.?
Note: one must be concurrently enrolled in another
100-level CS course to take CS 196.?
Before someone asks, CS 357 (Computer Assisted Instruction)
is now renumbered CS 317.?
See old note ¬$373 in the group which started 8/1/75 for
further discussion of this subject.

---------- response 4
  08/25     10.15     friedman       csa

By the way, CS 196 (109) is NOT primarily a Plato course.
It is an honors course, accompanying enrollment in
introductory CS courses, for those who want to do some
extra work in CS. It happens to have been done on Plato
for a number of consecutive semesters, but there is NO
guarantee that this will continue to be the case.

---------- response 5
  08/25     10.29     danielson       csa

    For this semester, at least, cs196 will follow the
format of the last few semesters. Among other topics,
students will be expected to learn TUTOR and do some
TUTOR programming for projects.

will undoubtably learn tutor and complete a project on
PLATO. this semester. The probably would have responded

     If - you create an author and give him a password
through course records, and he signs in and sets his user
option to on, he will dutifully appear immediately on the
list.
        If - you create an author and do not give him a
password through course records, and he signs in and sets
his user option, he WILL NOT appear on the list until
he signs off, and then back in again...

You need not even create a new record... several attempts
to set my "system user list" flag to "on" failed thru the
"I" option while just one attempt thru the "U", LAB option
worked.

  08/22     20.14     tricorn       hebrew

   Here's how it works, I think.
If you are turned off when you sign on, turn it on through
'I', you are not on the list until you sign on again.
However, if you modify the flag through 'U', it takes
effect immediately.

     But I does work if you set it through I, and
then sign off. then sign on again...

---------- note 10  set error
  08/22     20.00     ian       conn

I really like the new command -set-, I have only
one complaint about it. Consider this code:

   calc     n1?1
   set      n(n1?n1+1)?4,5

yields the excecution error:

"unmatched parentheses

set         n(n_1_,n1+1)?4,5"
Is there any chance that this might be allowed
in the future?

Ian

---------- response 1
  08/22     21.40     telson       arizona

The -set- command is for arrays---your use
looks like:
     set     n(n1?n1+something)
and the error looks like:
     set     n(n1,n1+something)

(it obligingly replaced the "?" with ",")
(seems as "?" is illegal in a subscript and it is
        getting confused)

and..........

Are you sure it wasn't a _condense_ error?

I have never seen an _execution_ error page
show the code in the line where the problem was.

---------- response 2
  08/22     22.02     ian       conn

Sorry, you are right, it is condense error.

But, i am not complaining about the ',' instead of
the '?'.  The fact that I got an error is what is
bothering me.  Often i have used

   calc    n(n1?n1+1)?4

or something such, and there is no error for that.
I understand that the -set- command was originally
designed for arrays, but the array elements are
simply variables!  It shouldn't matter that my variable
is not a member of an array.

Anyway, I have used the -set- command many times
without an array.

Perhaps I don't understand what you are saying, but
I think this should be implemented.
Ian

---------- response 3
  08/22     22.56     parrello       uimatha

You will notice that the error given was "unbalanced
parentheses". The -set- command found the first '?' and
assumed it was the main assign arrow. Thus the condensor
would interpret
set     n(n1?n1+1)?n2,n3,n4

as

calc    n(n1    to    n1+1)?n2
calc    n(n1+1  to    n3
calc    n(n1+2  to    n4

I guess those are the breaks.

---------- response 4
  08/22     23.12     shirer       s

   Indeed...the reason this is not allowed is because "set"
does NOT do a full compilation on the complete string, but
uses condense machinery originally set up for other
commands to save space. In order to do this, the ? must
be replaced by a , or a condense error will occur. The
? was chosen to make the -set- look more like a -calc-. The
aids description is fairly explicit that the first argument
must be either a simple variable or an array, NOT a
calculated variable like n(n1+1). It would be nicer if
this were done, I agree, but space and time limitations
made the present method expedient.
   No change will probably be made in the near future,
since I am back at my remote terminal massaging students
not computers for 9 months. Don S.

---------- response 5
  08/23     01.59     ian       conn

Ok, thanx. And thanx again for the set command. A
hasty X-search through my lesson reveal that happily
by chance all of my 13 -set-s contain a simple variable
for the first argument. You are right, it is explained
quite well in aids. Too bad, it means me adding
another WHOLE line!

---------- note 11 surprise!
  08/22     20.02     parrello       mfl

Thanks very much for making -helpop-s active at a -pause-.

For those of you who are not clairvoyant, the -helpop-
branches at -pause-s are simple -goto-s. As a result,
all lessons using -helpop-s which have -pause- commands in
them will be plunged into unimaginable chaos. I am sure
glad the systems staff implemented this change today instead
of next week since now I have a whole weekend to fix all
the lessons that have been affected. I would suggest that
all other people in charge of instructional lessons check
them out fast, since classes start Monday! Thanks to the
system staff again for making the behaviour of a -helpop-
at a -pause- a COMPLETE SURPRISE and springing it on us
WITH NO ADVANCE WARNING AS TO THE DATE OF IMPLEMENTATION!

---------- response 1
  08/22     21.28     andersen       s

Mea Culpa!

There had been requests for "pause keys=help" to
be made consistent. That is, a preceding -helpop- or a
preceding -help- should be treated the same way. Imagine
my chagrin, following your note, to find that "aids"
abundantly documents the inconsistency! You have me.
For now we retreat to the form described in aids, and we
leave till later a renewed attempt to clean up this area.

---------- response 2
  08/22     22.52     parrello       uimatha

Yeah. I was merely caught off guard by the fact that it
didn't return to the pause. Most of us were expecting it
to work similarly to the way it does at an arrow (with the
return) and the blanket -goto- gave me visions of lost
weekends...

Thanks

Hmmmm.....now I'm more puzzled.

In the presence of an -arrow-, but with a -pause-, you
will come back to the -arrow-. It is a little hard to
see what should be natural relative to -helpop- in a unit
which doesn't have an -arrow-. That is, -helpop- really
goes with an -arrow-. Without an -arrow-, it is trivial
to program a -do- just after a "pause keys=help", and
it doesn't seem particularly rational to stick in a
preceding -helpop- command in such a unit. Comments?

---------- response 4
  08/23     00.53     dave fuller       uimc

??    It seems a little "nicer" to have a helpop as
a branching command in the context:?
unit    instruct
helpop  moresame
next    nextunit
back    lastunit
at      1010
write   This is the way it is... Press HELP to
        see a bit more, or NEXT to progress,
        BACK to regress...

c       
unit    moresame
at      1810    
write   Dazed and confused? Think of it this
        way:
        
        Rather than have to resort to a -pause- device
way down in some code. Perhaps the only drawback is that
repeated HELP's will cause erasure of the helpop and
subsequent rewriting...

---------- response 5
  08/23     11.07     dave       matha

I thought the general idea of the -helpop- was to allow you
to go off on a short tangent without losing your place in
the lesson. Is that right? (I'm thinking of examples
like a calculator, a debugging unit, or communications.)
        If so, it seems to me like a -helpop- at a pause
would quite naturally return to the pause.
(Offhand, it seems like that should be true even if
an arrow is present: -helpop- at an arrow goes back to the
arrow, and -helpop- at a pause goes back to the pause.)
In the case of a -helpop- at a pause without an arrow, I
agree that it's easy to put in a -do- after the pause. But
isn't it also easy to put in a -goto- ? A -helpop- which
acts like a -do- seems to be a much more powerful feature
than one which acts like a -goto-, for cases where a
-helpop- key would be imained to an auxiliary unit for an
entire curriculum.

---------- response 6
  08/23     21.14     john r       reading

The -do- after a pause requires, really, several
extra lines if it is to be a temporary branch. To wit:

a label before the pause (so one can get back to it),
a saving of the value of key after the pause (so that
any checks of the sort 'key=' can be done on 'var=x' to
avoid confusion from keys pressed during the helpop
unit),
and a conditional branch following the -do- to get back
to the pause.

Is this not due to the fact that a number that large sets
the leftmost (sign) variable in the word? If you had
to, couldn't you test to the value of that bit, and ad-
just accordingly?

---------- response 2
  08/24     13.18     dave fuller       uimc

        As an integer, the sign bit is set, but as a
floating number, it is positive. Now, _I_ know that this
can be gotten around, but think of some poor person that
does:

calc    v1?10?18??
writec  v1¬,¬,¬,Positive, right?

        And finds out that 10?18?? isn't positive...

     That I can accept as a response, Bruce... The gist
of what I said was a prompt to anyone pondering doing
such operations, and a gentle jab to the AIDS people to
document the fact that conditional statements convert to
integer a bit better...
     The actual phrase used is "rounds to an integer",
which is inadequate. I suggest that they put a pointer to
a more detailed discussion of the ramifications of this
seemingly harmless statement. Perhaps, too, a pointer to
"the handling of conditional statements" from the individual
commands.

No it's not just another bug in TUTOR.  It's a bug in
your interpretation of what the condensor does with defines.
The define command is a text substitution command.
Therefore the condensor doesn't know you aren't planning
to combine defined names to get a balanced expression.

Why is it that when you place an arrow, "where" is
calculated incorrectly; that is, 4 lines down from where
the arrow is? Example:
arrow  1010

Somewhere buried in the bowels of AIDS is a description
of the default position of screen writing following
an arrow.  To paraphrase, it says that writing (say, after
a "wrong") is placed down and to the right of the arrow
automatically if there is no "at" supplied.

It would seem that "where" is updated to this default
screen position.

   Another possible inconsistency in the -helpop- machinery:
   
   At an arrow, type an incorrect answer, getting "no" and
some feedback. Then hit -HELP- and go to a helpop unit,
at which time the old arrow, the response and feedback are
all erased.

   Do the same thing at an arrow in the -helpop- unit, and
hit -BACK- to return to main arrow. This time the arrow
is erased, but the response ¬+ feedback is NOT.

in view of the predicted severe scrunch on resources will
there be any organized attempt to limit the heavy

will there be at least some official word from PLATO that
users fulfilling contractual agreements and class require-

It has never been the function of the system to arbitrarily

It has been said that CERL, with its support staff, supplies
a _medium_ for CAI and (some exceptions to the contrary)
tries to refrain from getting more involved than merely
providing this medium.

"Course restrictions" work very well at most sites when
things get out of hand ("things" meaning "recreational
users").

Long-range funding hassles notwithstanding (?), good old
supply and demand will probably dictate availability of
these resources to "recreational" and "more serious" users,
in one proportion or another, as things tighten up.

your problem. As fay/o pointed out, the major curriculum

Suppose I spend $45 million and 5 years to build a small
university. (very small at today's prices) Suppose also
that I spend $2.5 million per year operating it. At the
end of another 5 years, how much instruction will I have
provided? What will the cost per hour be?

Using that cockeyed logic, PLATO is already a fantastic
bargain. It has delivered 1.5 million contact hours
and may yeild 7 or 8 million more in the next 5 years.

But seriously, most of that $45 million went for industrial
plants which are expected to do more than supply the PLATO
market. Much of the rest went for research.

We can't come back to a -pause- from a helpop unit without
introducing an unfortunate inconsistency. Since a helpop
unit can have an arrow, going to a helpop unit has to act
pretty much like a -goto-, ending with a judge ignore
(if there is an arrow in the helpop unit) or a judge exit 
(if there is no arrow in the helpop unit). There is just
too much status associated with the original arrow to
permit anything other than returning to the original arrow,
not to a -pause- following that arrow. This means that
for consistency we should do the same in the case where
there is no -arrow- in the original unit: namely, treat
the branch as a -goto-, not as a -do-. Of course it is
relatively easy to synthesize a -do- on key=help, without
having a -helpop- unit defined.

Hmm. I vote against the change. the '_0_n_p_age' in the name
of the command, and the way it behaves at an arrow, and
the use of pauses in place of arrows for some purposes -
all these will cuase unending confusion for beginners
and those of us with mnemonic minds.

I would prefer that helpop NOT be active at pauses rather
than having it be active in ways at variance with one's
intuition.

I have to agree.

Changing the command in this fashion would not
eliminate the inconsistency.  It would simply change
it from one thing to another.

I vote that it be left so the branch is not taken.  It
is easy enough to add a conditional-do after a pause.

I would have to be against the change.  For one thing, it
is not natural to have the -helpop- branch fly out of the
unit and never return since it DOES return to the -arrow-.
The idea behind the -helpop- is to give the user extra
information without forcing him to lose his place in the
main unit (along with everything else, like his current
display, and so forth).  It is completely natural to have
it return, in a manner similar to a standard help sequence.
To have a -helpop- branch go away and never come back
reduces its purpose to that of a routing key.  Thus, the
use and justification for -helpop- is DIFFERENT depending
on the command at which it is pressed.  Now, if one under-
stands how the -helpop- key is implemented, then your
proposal would seem consistent.  To the average author you
are confusing the already confused -helpop- scene even more.

         which do _not_ return?

Also, to the system programmers:  will this -goto- helpop
unthread the -do- stach? or will entering a -helpop- unit
pull one out of the current unit instead of the main
unit?

Except where it happens unintentionally during prime time.
It is far better that an instructor (who should know how
to contact the operator in such a situation) verify that
the condensor is indeed down for the count and communicate
that fact as soon as possible than to have dozens of
students interrupted.  The message is designed for such
emergency cases rather than the "normal" non-prime
encounters that we typically see.   Al Avner

---------- response 6
  08/26     16.03     ian       cs491

         The reasoning seems to be that if the
condensor is not available, the operator should be
informed as directly as possible. i.e. by telling the
student to call his instructor, who may or may
not be available; the instructor then, hopefully,
knows enough to call the operator, who, in
prime time, is in the process of getting
calls from some number of instructors.
Wouldn't it be easier for the condensor n.a...
message to go directly to the operator, while
some innocuous panacea goes to the student.
That way, serious problems are still brought to
the operator's attention quickly, without
glorifying the normal innocuous situation with
the dignity of a -call your instructor- request.

Its not a "time station", its just a digital wall clock,
essentially. So the time will be only as accurate as the
power company's 60-cycle, and of course the original setting
of the clock. We do expect to get this working in the very

The best way (and easiest) to set your wall clock accurately
is by calling (312) 228-8000. This is Illinois Bell's time
service, and is linked to WWV, the National Bureau of
Standards. This is the less expensive than buying a
reciever, unless you set the clock a lot...

    With all the recent problems concerning ecs and
cpu resources, and with the continuing nature of the
problems, I was wondering whether there was any program
designed to help authors to program more 'efficiently'
than they might think of as first.

    I realize that it is fairly easy to test out the
relative efficiency of one set of code versus another, but
what isn't so easy is discovering by trial and error what
the best technique would be to make the most efficient use
of ecs space and cpu processing time.

        In many cases, almost any method of coding may be
used with little difference. Also, I'm sure most authors
are not very much concerned with 'efficiency' as I mean it
here (and rightly so). However,  there are probably enough
authors and applications that'd benefit from such a program.

I agree with you Danny. In 1st and 2nd generation programm-
ing, a programmer was extremely cognizant of saving core.
Many good ideas emerged out of this era for coding efficent-
ly. Core storage today is more abundant but with systems
like PLATO it is just as important to save storage and
decrease execution time. One of the most important things
to remember is to plan your entire lesson on paper using
flowcharts, HIPO, or whatever. This allows you to identify
your main line logic, subroutines and help units in
advance. I believe we have too many authors going from the
idea stage straight to the keyset. I have given a simple
programming problem to students who solve it using any-
where from 13 to 37 statements. Some are obviously more
efficient than others. Suggest careful reading of

authors are exceedingly resistant to any suggestions
about making "paper" plans of lessons to the flow chart
stage ahead of time-- in a non-military, non-class room

convince them that this is in their interest-- hence
it doesn't happen.

Planning is an every day activity in business. It saves time

Ask any programmer (author) or systms analyst in  a

Paperwork planning also becomes part of documentation
which can be of tremedous value. Documentation.....now

There are surely exceptions, but I think that an outline
bigger than what would fill a Plato screen probably isn't
much use in lesson planning.  It is so easy to type and
edit on Plato that it seems pointless to have paper
documentation.  Most lessons are not adequately documented,
but the additional documentation could and should be right
in the lesson.  The lack of disk space has discouraged
people from proper documentation, but for a successful
system, adequate disk space to allow documentation MUST
be found.

Furthermore, a picture on paper just doesn't have the same
"feel" as a picture with orange dots.  Before complete
lessons can be successfully planned on paper, authors
must get a great deal more experience, so that they can
visualize the "feel" of a paper picture or flowchart.

I would like to see people outline their lessons in much
the same way that they would outline an essay for a

greatly improve the lesson structure.  A simple flow-chart
would serve the same purpose.

There are other mistakes which will give "Too Much Proces-

charset. ( the old infinite loop ) I don't think the
problem will arise under standard ( no programming mistakes)
conditions. Some of our programs have very large calcula-

you obviously have never had a large number of conden_S_e

of blocks set out of a large number (maybe a 4-part lesson),
and have a lot of "block not found" notices, for instance,
youget a message saying that only X errors out of your total

by fixing some of the ones already displayed: I suspect
there just isn't room in the buffer for more than X (is it

   Since you are actually in another lesson when you
are looking at the condense error information, the
lesson you condensed does not have anyone "in" it yet.
Note that since students never see condense errors,
such "strange" deletions cannot occur for students.
The system can indeed be changed to "hold" the lesson
while the condense error information is being examined.

why does:
font,a,b,half back sp,n,c,d,e,lock sub, back sp,back sp,
back sp,back sp,half back sp,g,half back sp,o,h,i,j,font,
lock sup. result in complete line erasure if near
the end you try to erase one or two keypresses.

As you can see this is a rather complicated character and
I was extremely irritated on several occasions to get near
the end, make a mistake and try to correct it, and find
that I had lost a whole line including several other equally
complicated characters which I had already completed.

If you wish to see this without duplicating it yourself,
leave me a pnote. The key seems to be the half back spaces.

And secondly when are we going to get a usable micro editor.
As you can see with this kind of a character I could use it

with the current editor.

One way to fix this if you happen to make this mistake is
to go ahead and erase the rest of the line and hit back.
Your line of code will then appear just as before you did
the current replace. You can then copy out the line up to
the point where you wanted it erased. Done!

     The last suggestion works fine if you're replacing
the line but it sure is a pain when something like that
happens while inserting a line. Needless to say I often
have the same problem and I find that the Shift-Square
is the culprit. I sure would appreciate it if someone
could fix this fluke.

It'll occur anytime there are backspace and you try to

If it was using 15+, it must have been running in

The same kind of hang-ups happened to my terminal up until
about 3 or 4 weeks ago.  (It most frequently happened as soon
as I hit the Auhtor Mode page after a system reload.)  One
night my terminal hung 3 times and stayed hung until the
system reloaded again.

But in recent weeks my terminal has not hung this completely
even once.  However it has hung for a few minutes at a time
..and then has unfrozen.

---------- response 6

About 2 weeks ago a PPU program was installed which checks
to see if any station is sending in too many keys.  If so,
input from that station is inhibited for about 90 seconds.
(This is a hardware shutoff at the site controller).
The station is then turned back on.  If it is still sending
keys at too high of a rate, it is again shut off and the
cycle repeats.

This should not cause anyone typing at a normal rate to be
shut off but if you are in a loop sending back keys as in
the case of oppy/research, you will probably be turned off.

The purpose of this is to prevent terminals and/or phone
lines which have gone bad from degrading the system.

This is not what johnston need....
He was -do-ing units at random (in a test type sequence)
and (since we have been having many line errors) he
decided to put in a function key to "redraw" the
screen (¬)redo that unit). He wanted to use DATA, but
couldn't since it initiated a help branch...

A base unit,  in this case, would make him forget that
he was in a -do-ne unit, no?

(see next response for example.....)

As I say, he wanted to use DATA but couldn't because

being random (and possibly hitting something already
-do-ne.)  Base would have the same effect.

All this points to the fact that he wanted to use
DATA but couldn't.....(I recommended that he use
BACK or ShiftBACK).

The original question was, how about a specs nohelp
to not make data initiate a help branch.
(Or as I suggested, a new command, -nohelp- which
would take tags like data, help1, etc. and make it
so that those keys did not initate a help branch)

This just seemed like a way that authors could tailor
their lessons to the needs of their students a little
easier, by controlling the branching effect.

Well, BACK or shift-BACK won't work any different in this
case -- you still will not come back from the done unit.
Incidentally,

unit   a
data   a
....

will not initiate a help sequence, if "a" is the main unit,
because a help sequence is terminated upon encountering
the unit which was made a base unit.
The real problem is not DATA vs. BACK, but rather how to
make either key perform a -goto- rather than -jump-.

do     nextone  $$ so next unit is "after"
present problem

And the -data- command specifies u1b,u2b, etc. to replot
the screen, having already chosen the number needed to
create that display......sigh. In my case it wasn't just
replotting the screen: the student can press shift-DATA
for a table of contents, then press BACK if he decides he
was in the right place after all. The effect is to replot
the screen, but after also having plotted the table of

If johnston just wants to replot the text part of a random

that would rewrite the text part. This would have the
advantage that whatever counters (like ntries) he
might have would remain...the student would be continuing
at the same arrow:

unit   prob1
do     replot1
dataop text1
arrow  510

unit   replot1

erase
do     text1

at     510

The -helpop-, etc. commands make a lot of things easier to

There is usually one block of data in ECS being accumulated.

Only when that block is full does it enter the datafile.
Thus, up to one block of old data may appear suddenly.

The data is also written to disk if there are no students
using that datafile on the system.

---------- response 2
  08/29     14.43     chabay       s

Do you mean that data from a previous session appeared in
the datafile, or that area summaries were generated for
the current session even though the area commands had
been deleted and the lesson recondensed?
The latter is possible, since data for the student's current
area is saved (cumulatively) until the student either
encounters another area command, or falls off the end of
the lesson, when the complete summary is generated.
You can use -area cancelled- to clear out this saved
information, without dumping anything into the datafile.

   -use- command in the lesson itself.

2) Lesson B -use-s lesson A and gives a condense error.

The condense error 'bad block' should be 'nested -use-s'
 if there should be a condense error at all (which I doubt).

  Nothing has been changed yet in the error handling
of -use- commands. A "nested use" would not be
appropriate for the case you describe--this occurs
only when a -use- command occurs among the commands
being used and has nothing to do with anything else
in the -use-d lesson. Perhaps you got one of our
"random" -use- errors--is it repeatable?

I don't understand how in lesson terminal it takes an
average of 902  terminals over 24 hours. I didn't think
there were 902 terminals in plato world. Also I would
think one would use 23 hours due to the fact of maintance.
There must be a simple answer to this....

---------- response 1
  09/01     11.18     avner       s

There are over 900 PLATO terminals (somewhere). Only
853 are currently assigned to dedicated phone lines. The
others use dial-up lines or float around using the various
"open" site and station numbers. Thus one terminal used
on several phone lines during a month may produce data that
make it look like many terminals have been active. This
comes out in the wash since the reports are in terms of
"terminal-hours" so it doesn't matter where the terminal
was located at the time the data came in. It would thus
be more accurate to say "902 lines used " but this is even
harder to explain. The data are collected on a 24-hour
basis since maintenance time may not always be taken (as
on weekends). The result is a more conservative estimate
of activity but we would rather err in that direction than
to inflate our data.

  This is a rather puzzling statement for two reasons:
(1) we nearly always give several warnings before
  loading a new version of the system (of course no
  warnings are possible in the cases of "crashes")
(2) planned "backouts" for reloads always save your
  most recent edits anyway, so even if you missed all
  the warning messages, your work would be saved.

doing when you lost code, we would be interested to

Both central memory and ECS are core, but not the same

if used for random access and much more expensive than
ECS.

The excellent speed of CDC machines comes much more from

  I doubt (but do not know) that all authors using more

being deleted when 90000 of 130000 words are in use, it
is possible that the author of the lesson recondensed it,
which would delete you.

to 100:, or do authors start getting deleted at some

On the occasion I was referring to, I was deleted from
my very own lesson, so obviously it hadn't been
recondensed (I hope!).  I checked shift-e for ECS and

Has anyone else noticed that if you forget to put any
unit names in your lesson that not only does the lesson
not run properly (boy does it not run properly!) but you
also don't get a condense error? I wrote a test block
the other day and forgot to put a unit name in it. I
condensed and pulled down 296.7 TIPS. I had no idea
what was going on either.  I assumed that the program
I was working on was doing so many calculations that
the system had bounced me without finishing.

Actually, it is somewhat logical.  Any TUTOR code in your
lesson preceeding a unit command is assumed to be the
initial entry unit.  The IEU is do-ne right after the first
unit command is executed.  But since there is no unit
command, the IEU is not executed, and you exit from the
lesson.  You'll notice the same results if you try to
condense a lesson containing nothing (or a lesson with
a cstop* command at the beginning, as well as some other
possibilities).  The high TIPS number is really meaningless,
since you were only in the lesson for a few milliseconds.

flaged off. You can tell which blocks are flaged when
looking at each part of your lesson but not from inside

   Anyone not constantly "toggling" the partial flags
may find it useful to modify their block names so that
the partialed out blocks all start with "-" (this also
helps to recover the proper normal state in event of
a mistake that suddenly finds you with all blocks
partialed in or out).
   We may add the part number and the partial flag state
info in the future; we DO want to keep the extra time
required to compute and display extra tidbits to an

This is certainly more readable than using -show- and

embedded judge would add legibility.

The repetition of long conditional expressions for
the -writec- and -judge- pains me, too.

    Since authors often wish to do two or three statements
if some conditional expression is true, why not add a new
control structure to TUTOR similar to an ALGOL _if_-_then_-_else_.
The original problem could then be solved as follows:

        if      (var>20)$or$(var<1)
        write   out of range
        judge   noquit
        endif
     The general syntax would have the form
  
         if      <some boolean expression>
                 <as many TUTOR statements as desired>
         else
                 <as many TUTOR statements as desired>

The _else_ part. of course, would be optional.

     Vastly so.
     I estimate that it would take about 20: the time to
develop a lesson using IF-THEN-ELSE, CASE, and FOR control
structures and local declaration of variables as it does
under the current TUTOR regime (even given the obviously
elaborate declarations needed).
     A major part of the saving would be from simple
free indentation facilities.
     Of course, local allocation would take a MUCH more
sophisticated condensor, and some extra goodies in the
interpreter, and won't come soon, if at all.
        But I remain hopeful.

      I had 2 blocks of defines in one lesson that
included a -common- command referring to common in that
lesson.  I wanted to -use- those blocks in another lesson,
but when I first condensed the using lesson, I got a
'common codeword protected' error.  I then went to the
first lesson's data page, and changed the common code
from something to blank, whic matched the common code
in the second (using) lesson.  Upon trying to condense,
I once again got this error.  I then signed off, and on
again as quickly as I could, and still yet was unable to
condense.  I then signed off, and stayed off for 5 min
while someone else used the terminal, and when I returned,
was able to condense the second lesson.
        This seems to indicate that not all of a lesson
is returned to disc when you get to the block directory

  Try aborting the common next time--a copy of the
common (with codewords) may be in ecs, if so, then
the codewords will be obtained from there rather than
the lesson directory.  The common abort (delete ecs
copy of the common) is available from the choice
display when you try to go into a common block.

---------- response 3

       That does work fine...

I presume that what was going on was that the disc copy
of common was updated as soon as I changed the code and
backed to the directory page, just as other blocks of
a lesson would be, but that the ECS copy of common, since
it existed at all, was assumed to be a valid copy, and to
save disc accesses, the disc copy was not fetched, even
though I forced a re-condense by -stop1- from the directory
page.   I'm not going to complain about this procedure,
since it enhances the overall response time, nor is it
likely to trip me up again, but perhaps some additional
discussion of the consequences of this choice  in the
aids index on common would help other innocent, over-eager
authors.

   Change your origin to 55,50. You are using such large
numbers in the label that you are running off the left
margin with consequent positioning problems.

   You might not have noticed because it is the blank
in front of the number reserved for a possible sign
which is doing the wraparound.

Is it possible to store the course name in the "lesson

That would be much more convenient than having my name
stored in the buffer...(I am continually ending up trying
to edit a lesson by the same name...worse, from time to
time a thoughtless press of DATA condenses it for me!)

This would be especially nice since it is _very_ easy to
unintentionally back out of the course editor completely.

        Are there any plans to implement scientific notation
labelling in the TUTOR graphing package?  I believe that
currently the only way to do this is to gimick up your own
-write- command below the x axis, which isn't too bad. But
labelling the y axis in this way is a little sloppier. This
feature (exponential labelling) seems like a natural addi-
tion to the graph package.

  09/05     23.37     fritz       ames

  If you:
Have some common named "test" (or any other name) at the
    end of your lesson, where it belongs, and
Create a block of source named "test" somewhere in the
    lesson, and
Convert the source to common, you will (to your surprise)
    discover that
The new common is appended onto the front of the old common
at the end of the lesson, even though the blocks are NOT
contiguous!  Somehow this does not seem right.  Anyone
care to explain this gem to me? (more why it's there
rather than why it happens, I [think I] understand the
reason)
?Later -- Correction:  it isn't necessarily attatched to
the front. Sometimes it is absorbed, never to be seen
again. Ie, I go to inspect the new common (which I
converted from source) I see the old common, and the
length is listed as that of the old common. The other
way, the length is listed as the sum of the two.  !??
 
---------- response 1
  09/06     00.29     white       p

At one time common blocks were just source blocks that
were referenced in a common statement.  Since then we
have come a long way, but we still allow common blocks
to be non-contiguous in the lesson.  (We eventually
plan to require them to be contiguous.)

The reason your source was overwritten by your old
common is that when your ecs copy of the old common
was returned to disk, it just overwrote the first
common block that had the name "test". The reason
the length was still listed as that of the old copy
is because the old copy was still in ecs.

This is a privilege currently accorded only to system

You can come close by doing an  X-"blah" search in a block

  09/06     20.57     fay       rtv362

To clarify Bill's comment:  the old instructor file suffered
from people editing it directly (ie, making changes directly
to the leslist or common instead of thru the curriculum
designer).  The bad thing about that was that 99.9: of
the people who did so had no idea of how to edit directly
in order to make the edits compatible with the various
flags, etc, used by the curriculum design machinery.
The end result was, in many cases, that the system router
would be unable to interpret the data stored there in a
meaningful way.  People insisted on complaining to systems
about errors in the way the router worked (or did not work)
when in fact it was the result of their own tampering.

it sounds great-- but you'd have to be sure to look at
cpu use as well as at the ecs, there would be disagreement
on where to set the thresholds-- and...

there is also the problem of the recreational users tying
up terminals--  unfortunately the point at which that
becomes a nuisance depends on how the terminals are
deployed.
*
the current formula on the medical site is a time check
(i don't know but i think an ecs check is also used).
the students can not sign into games until late in the
evenings or weekend when resources are almost always
plentiful-- they are signed off automatically by the system
when it reloads in the morning-- and then they are locked
out-- this is a compromise which seems to work ok.
vince wu/mcl can give you details on the code used.
for the record, i have always favored use of overflow

-vtoa- is useful for preparing a common which will be
converted to source and printed out. Thus, you can
give a teacher something like this on paper:
*
*
joe schmo              section c
            unit 1
present tense   5 of 10  50.0: right
past tense      3 of  9  33.3: right
future tense    7 of 11  63.3: right
grand total    15 of 30  50.0: right
*
*
If you are reading out of a datafile, -itoa- can give
you all the whole number, but only -vtoa- will give you
the percentages easily.

P.S. -atoi- can be done with "storea" and "compute".

Judy:

When you work on the algebraic manipulation of formulas,
like in symbolic differentiation and integration, you are
creating new values (Dvx v xn = v?n xn-1, etc.). When
writing -calc2- some years ago, I had to go to awful
lengths to circumvent the non-existence of -vtoa- in
handling my formulas.

It seems to me that the conversion features do exist
in the executor - and it would be quite convenient
and execution-load saving not to have to recreate
these wheels in TUTOR code.

   PLATO III did in fact allow redirection of output, which
solved the "vtoa" problem very nicely.  There seems to be
an increasing need on the part of users to do things like
generate reports in datasets or common for eventual

The problem is that even though we can now keep several
keys in our timing queues at once, if more than one timing
key is up in any 64 millisecond period, one will overwrite
the other.  Our standard way to get around this is to
allow any timing type key (catchup, timeup, longup,
routup, tutup) to break through -catchup- or -pause-
in case the key that was wanted was overwritten by
the timing key that we receive [nobody need understand
the above explaination].  In any case, your problem
was that timeup was overwriting catchup, and the
-catchup- command was waiting for *catchup*, not
*timeup*.  Until we fix the overwriting of timing
keys by each other (in about 1.5 years), I have
made *timeup* break through a -catchup-.

       help notes, where they are read by people who

However, until the PLATO project finds some money in its

Being one who writes or am responsible for unorthodox notes

lack of judgment on the part of those authors who report
matters having little lasting importance and hence no place

Inspecting the data page of one of my lessons this morning,
I found that it is classified under "account:  games".

I was unable to find this notation on lessons other than
those that were also classified as "games".

I hope this is not premature, but it seems to indicate
that someone is taking it upon himself to determine what
is or is not a game - there is no need to repeat countless
discussions on the subject.

I hope that someone will write a new system features note

The  classifications are only for an experiment in

I repeat.  We needed to generate some data for an experiment
In this case, any lessons are as good as any others.  No
attempt at a complicated philosophical analysis has been
made.  We merely chose some lessons likely to get used.
As a matter of record, those are the lessons the operators
think are games.  Some of them are certainly not games. Many
real games are not included.  It doesn't make any difference

In that case, it would seem that any data that you collect
on the use of these particular lessons woold be meaningless.

If you included all games, you could get meaningful data
on the total use of all games.  What kind of data could

indeed NOT all games.

But Mike, that goes back to the discussion of:

....and I can't remember how many times ths discussion
wasted disk space in NOTES before. I think the whole idea
is that the systems people would like to collect some
sample statistics on lessons deemed more  "recreational"
than "educational" by the people who use them and the
people who have to supervise them.

        But,  seeing that lesson spaces are constantly
changing, I don't see where a permanent classification

     Suggestion:
    
     Sometimes its more efficient to write a -pause-
loop with a -keytype- command instead of a judging sequence
to catch the keypress of a student and then do some action
dependent on the key pressed.  Say, for example, you had the
following -keytype- command:

keytype option,a,b,c,d,e,f,g
do      option,x,ro,r1,r2,r3,r4,r5,r6,x

Great.  But suppose you want the student to be able to
press either a, or A, etc.?    Wouldn't things be easier
and more elegant if you could use parentheses to enclose
equivalent keys?  Right now, you'd have to use a -group-
command for each pair of letters, or two -do- statements.
(And there might be cases where that would be hard to work.)
Would the resources required to make this change
be excessive?  The machinery must already exist, since
the -match- command has this capability.

I happen to believe that the game playing situation is

didn't think so, I would consider your proposal step in
the wrong direction because it will tend to suggest to
course directors that they are relieved of responsibility
for records of this type.  We need to have course directors
personally responsible for the use made of the system by
users they authorize.  It doesn't cost them anything to
create a record.  Why not be a nice guy and pass them out
freely?  But if that were done, do you really trust an
automated decision maker to see to it that your students
get first crack at PLATO?

  Sure I do!  If I didn't trust an automated decision
maker, I wouldn't use PLATO at all! My main point is that
I know of no way to control for CPU or ECS, except when the
student signs on.  Thus, if I create a record as carefully
and as controlled as possible, I still cannot ( to my
knowledge ) watch for changing CPU ( or ECS ) situations.
Thus I cannot in good conscience create any record with
any access to any game.  Thos my students' complaints.

 It seems rather redundant to show the instructor file
info at each and every entry into the curriculum editor.
I also feel that you should be able to add a lesson to
the lesson catalog (when editing a module) without backing
clear out to the main choice page and entering the catalog
editor.  And as long as we're there, how come you can't
delete (or at least change the names of) lessons in the
catalog?
And, one final gripe which bothered me in the old systems
router as well.  WHY can't we set SOME kind of flag (in
stud. vars, router vars, SOMEwhere) to indicate where the
student is going?  I have several small drill items in
single lessons and I don't like giving the student indexes
27 deep to get to what he wants to see.  If I could set,
say, n150 to 1 to indicate the student wants drill A,
then I can just test on the value of n150 and jump to the
appropriate place in my lesson.  Please?

There were at least two cases today of students failing
to make a successful -jumpout- from router to a lesson.
The lessons in question had been successfully attached by
several other students during the day, so I assume the
problem had to do with the -use bug.

I _do_ hate to have to make such assumptions, but no useful
error information is output to a data file when fatal
condense errors occur.  Our router does its own output in
such cases, but it can't tell us whether the problem was
with the -use- bug, a unit name, a mismatched common length,
a codeword mismatch, etc.  It would be nice (and
reasonable?) if error output similar to the fatal condense
screen displays were output to a datafile if one is
available.  Any chance of such?

Sigh.  It would indeed be nice, but we can't do it --
the student isn't connected to the datafile until he
gets into the lesson.

Perhaps in addition to returning *errtype* = 2 for fatal
condense errors, though, we could set an additional flag
which would identify the type of error.

if we knew it was a use command failure, we could try the

what is the official policy on ways to get in to use

locked.  if someone is using the copier while the operator
is out, (s)he generally gets to finish copying.  is the
person copying allowed to let other persons in to copy?
when i have been looking desperately for an operator in

If for some reason you cannot find an operator when your
need for a backup happens, you can leave a pnote to any
of the operators listed.  However, service would probably
be quicker if you send it to myself, or one of the other
full-time operators as some of the student ops may not
see the note for a couple of days.  I believe both our

In fact I would almost prefer a pnote so that I would have
the  infomation necessary and then could confer with the
requestor personally if there was some question as to what
was needed, or if a backup was needed.  It might be possible
in the future that we could provide the operator schedule
for the current week so that you would know who to contact
at the time via pnote if they were not immediately available
via term "operator", or via foot.

till Monday if it was made after 5 pm.

In addition to problems with using the copier, there is
the problem of the user who comes all the way accross
campus to get a printout only to find the door locked when
he gets there.  I think it is a great advance that a

Well, it is true that the PLATO system can run quite well
by itself, for quite a while.  However, there is more to
operating PLATO than just making sure the computer is
operational!  If users want prints, operators have to go
to the computer room to retrieve them.  If users want to
have backups of lessons, operators have to leave to set _that_
up, too.  Operators also have regular functions to perform
with the computer itself, which require time spent in the
computer room.  Add all this together, and you _should_ see
that operators can often be quite busy "operating" the
computer.  Yes, PLATO can run by itself.  But, if you
complain about lack of service by operators, you are just
not informed about the operator's function.  In fact, the
only time the operators are _not_ performing some service duty
is when they go to (1 lunch, or (2 the john.

to show the importance of same.
If you met your demise this instant, who would take over

could explain what you were doing with PLATO lessons that
may save someone a lot of time, money or sanity?  What
lessons are you responsible for writing, maintaining, etc.?
Who wrote the lessons? Why? Was it part of an overall plan?
If your lesson is half finished, how does the new author
pick up where you left off? Are there enough embedded
notes to explain your logic? (We all have our style
don't we?)  What if a fire or some other disaster occurs
at CERL, what happens to your lessons? To answer a personal
question, the student need not be aware of documentation.

rlr raises a good point that is often forgotten on
PLATO.  Industry is begining to learn the lesson,
and some DP shops now spend more time documenting
than on writting the actual code.  Something that
is very interesting is that in DP shops where documentation
has been well used are finding that they get more
lines of code per programmer than if the programmers had
to provide little or no documentation.  IBM's 'HIPO'
documentation system recomends doing the documentation
first, then doing the actual coding.  IBM requires the use
of 'HIPO' for _all_ internal programming, and is finding
that they are producing much more reliable code in
shorter periods of time.     (They must have learned
their lesson after the decade and mega-bucks spent on
developing OS/360.)

if the notes facility is indeed to be overhauled,
and it is not yet too late to introduce such a thing,
why couldn't you, this time, add a real keyword facility.
the author of each note would be asked after indicating
the end of the note to enter up to, say, five keywords
describing the areas of relevance of his note.  in addition
to the chronological displays now possible, a list of all
keywords currently in use could be displayed, and on
entering a keyword the viewer could move forward or
backward chronologically through notes with that descriptor
attached. boolean operations on the keywords would not
be vital (or necessarily useful, given such uncontrolled
indexing). while acknowledging that this would be a lot of

such a scheme!

I'm not a sysperson, but I know what the problem is.
comp and sign are both new functions. comp(x) returns
the bitwise complement of x, so that
0000000000012345677 comes out
0777777777765432100.
sign(x) returns -1 if x<0, 0 if x=0, 1 if x>0.
If system functions are redefined, the system functions
become unavailable and the user defines take over. A
warning message is shown. Changing the name of the
defined function will fix the problem. Adding "x" as
you suggest will do it, except possibly in the case of
student defines used at an arrow.

        Whether or not sysvars are used widely in lessons
(as they indeed are) wouldn't matter if Systems decided
to implement the convention you suggest. They would simply
have to run a conversion routine that would change all
references in lessons to the new names. That would cost
overhead, however, and its really much easier for _you_ to
change _your_ variable names by adding a "z" or "x".

However, the point is that something that is written today
may conflict with a new sysvar or sysfunction that is
implemented tomorrow. The suggestion to use some naming
convention for these sys words would make matters much
easier for authors. In this manner, an author could just
simply not use any names that fall into the sys word
convention.

This kind of a convention is important if PLATO is expected
to expand its software, and yet have lessons which will
survive software changes, such as the adding of sysvars
and sysfunctions.

We cannot expect lessons to survive if a new version
of the software conflicts with old lesson code. If lessons
do not survive, the PLATO cannot survive. The suggestion
of naming conventions is extremely reasonable and probably
desirable. Systems comment???

Remember that a define command takes precedence over
system definitions. There is therefore no danger that
a new system function will cause existing lessons to
stop working. (Although they will get a condense warning.)

I think the signon procedure might be simplified for
beginning Plato students (1st or 2nd time) if each of
three sign-in pages were labeled.
     Labels appearing near the bottom of the page such as

N A M E

C O U R S E

P A S S W O R D

would be seen much easier than the word 'course' such as
is hidden within the second page. Students often do
not read the instructions because they are too busy
trying to figure out what to do.. These labels would
enable an instructor to say 'Type in ***** on the course
page' and students would get some grasp of what the
course page really is.

Some people read the instructions tooo carefully. When
visitors see the instruction "type your name" they type
theirs in, then find out they don't have a course or aren't
registered. It seems like "type your registered name"
would be more accurate.

Maybe this is why most people don't bother with
instructions?

I think that this feature would make the process at

We have found here at the med center that most students
are confused by the word "course". They have no problems
with entering there name but when they see "Type the name
of your course..." they enter things such as "biochemistry"
or "anatomy" or whatever it is they came in to study.
It might be better if the wording was changed to "Type the
name of your PLATO course.." although I'm sure some student
will say to me, "But I didn't register for a course in
PLATO. I want to learn biochemistry." Sigh.

Instructions, as someone here commented, are indeed least
useful to those who need them most--they are often too
dis-oriented to make sense out of them. The cueing
suggested in this note appears to have some merit. The
largest benefit is probably the simplicity with which one
can then give instructions to students about how to sign in.

It will always remain the responsibility and task of the
instructor to introduce students to the terminal, however--
no system of cueing can succeed on its own for all students.

Last winter when a new signon procedure was being designed,

Since we are trying to be good neighbors down here at

Is the ECS charge for the system router 50 words?
Do individual course routers shared by more than one

running on the router, or does each student get charged
for the whole router?
We were wondering since ECS seems to be getting

Yes the current charge for the system router is 50 words per
student, but it may have to go up some.

Other routers are like ordinary lessons, they are charged to
a site once for any number of users. Any storage a router
may use, and the router variables, are charged to each
student.

It really is Plato, the Greek, but having chosen the name,

        Most of the time people think of the acronym

     2. A previous respone tells what PLATO "stands

   Sorry, I must object! The SOCRATES programming system

but it was well over a year after Scott and I came to
to the PLATO project before many of the programming
features (like being able to sign on and off and be a

implemented on the PLATO III system. (This was in the

It was the hardware configuration of SOCRATES that I was
referring to, Rick. It was indeed the case that the
software that you, Scott, et al provided for SOCRATES was
in some respects very elegant compared to the PLATO software
of the same era. But it is also true that SOCRATES died
and you came to work at PLATO. The point of my incidental
remark was that the complaints one sometimes hears about
the final decisions at PLATO being made by engineers are
know-nothing complaints. The landscape is littered with
the bones of systems where the final decisions were made
by educators/psychologists.

It would be nice to have a feature in course records which

Lacking this, it would be useful to be able to delete a

It might be safest to do this as a blanket delete in
much the same way that new messages are now written...
i.e., the system would scan for people not having signed
on in xx days, present the name of the first person
who fulfills the condition and allows Shift-HELP to
delete or Shift-NEXT to leave him around. This would
allow you to inspect the names before deletion in case
there is someone who has been off for some legitimate

I would hope that the course director would check with the

other classrooms for daytime work, and many students are

The point is that the flag that -chartst- tests is not
getting set to indicate that another charset has been
loaded. So when he goes back into his lesson, his
-chartst- will indicate that his charset is still loaded,
when in fact his terminal now contains the charset of

I could certainly make use of it.

I don't see the relation between auto-breakable -calc-s
and being able to look at embedded -branch-es.

But possibly this will clear things up a bit. When you
are in step mode, you are NOT looking at the actual code
in your lesson, but a complied form of that code called
a binary. It just so happens that a -branch- (same with
-doto-)is compiled the same way as a -calc- statement
(more or less) so PLATO only knows that it is somewhere
in a -calc- when it actually is executing a TUTOR -branch-.

        But it would be nice to be able to see which
LABEL (if any) you are currently at in the same manner

Oh, I thought there was something wrong!
That option works on the last edited time of the blocks.
As that is only stored to the minute, and -next1-/-back1-
can be done in much less than a minute... that is why
it does as it does.
If you go into block a and edit something, press -back-
then go into block b, edit something and exit from the

runs out first)...

    which are imposed by others.
(b) Until the required ratios are reached and "it can be
    proven that discrimination no longer exists" what is

    discrimination?
(c) If two equally qualified candidates are tied for the

    criteria will the choice be made? A coin toss would
    obviously be the fairset way.

The Steward Observatory, associated with the U of Arizona,

reduction computers right at the telescope. The data
is stored on punch tape for late analysis on one of the
university computers, while the NOVA allows the working
astronomer to see some preliminary results while he is
still working. I am not familiar with the hardware or

Would it be possible to calculate ¬p to the 20th digit
using the systems calculator?
  Is there a way I can recieve any answer in more than
ten digits?
  It certainly would be helpful if a person could denote
one variable to be able to hold more than 10 digits.
  Here is an example of what I want to do:
     calc v1?sqrt2
  But I want to calculate it to the 50th digit. Would it
be possible to set up a command called denote? The denote
command would cram all the variables in part of the tag
into one single variable e.g.,denote v1?v2,v3,v4,v5
This would allow you to calculate something then bring
it to the 50th digit. (since v1 is really v1,2,3,4,and 5
thanks to the denote command) By doing this, you would
be able to calculate ¬p to as much as the 100th digit,
Personally, I think that there are many authors that
would like to be able to do this.

Also, some of the answers to this question are less than
helpful (in fact, erroneous). 48-bit precision is far in
excess of the needs of most CBE applications. Hence, we
have no standard procedure for multiple-precision. However,
the baisc calc features are more than sufficient for anyone
desiring to add them to their own code for special purposes.

Our BASIC compiler/interpreter actually blocks out
the last 12 bits of each data item (i.e., of a 60
bit CDC word, we use only the first 48 bits, of those
then the last 36 are the fractional part), and that
is adaequate for numerical applications in calculus.

Last night, a strange problem arose...
        The Accounting students have a test very soon,
therefore they wanted to get in some time on PLATO. It
seems that the air-conditioning at FLB was on the blink,
and they all came to CERL. Fine. But, since it was Dad's
day and all, there were very few open terminals. So, the
operator sent the usual message: NO games. Then, he went
thru the site and told all gamers to leave. Still, there
weren't enough terminals. So, he asked authors if they
would yield their terminals. The accy students had time
reserved at FLB, so, in my view, it was only fitting that
they be allowed to complete their work. It is unfortunate
that some working authors had to leave, but students do
have priority. ALL gamers, authors/students/multiples,
were asked to leave. Please, talk to the operator if
you are in need of a terminal for work. Thanks...

of user. I don't know what the system router does.

   Access to a system variable such as *stactive* that would

new and undocumented 'feature'. naturally, it will wreak
havoc with code of the form.

I think that it has always been that way, which does not
however justify it. Shouldn't it be changed?

Also, it has been pointed out that a full-screen erase
sets the terminal mode to "write" but does not change
system variable "mode". Shouldn't a full-screen erase
restore whatever mode was current before the erase?

As the person who started this mess in help notes:

The new interaction of erase and unit with mode seems
best to me: Whenever the screen is fully erased, you are
returned to mode write (mode erase won't show up, and
mode rewrite being the same as write in that case).
On the other hand, after an erase with a tag, in which
case only part of the screen is erased, the mode stays
the same, as it is still useful.

One vote to leave the erase/mode interaction the same!!!!!

On the other hand, I have never seen much logic in the
interaction of erase and unit with where. It might make
good sense to have where go to some fixed location after
a full screen erase, like 510, so that for long text
sequences, no ats would be needed. after an erase with
a tag, the current scheme of leaving where at the left
end of the erased block is the best, it is useful this
way.

Bruce:

At least the following people believe that -where- has
traditionally been updated immediately after a selective
erase:

        John Risken
        Celia Davis
        Jim Kraatz
        Bob Yeager
        Gary Michael

AIDS states that -where- is updated at the end of each line
of code.

-showa- has always been talked about as being the only
real anomaly in the updating of where.

If all this changed, when did it change?

---------- response 5

1) Full screen erases probably should keep the last mode.
   Example for full screen erase and mode:
   unit that does some animation for example in mode write,
   using full screen erases. Person changes to mode erase.
   It would be rediculous for the unit to plot the same
   thing in mode erase as in mode write.
     (does make sense doesn't it?)

2) Should where be updated after erase n? Seems to be the
best cleanup. (also it has always worked as is now)
  Example for erase n:
  at      1010
  write   TEXT=
  showa   n123,n99
  pause
  at      1010
  erase   5
  erase   n99

   Those interested could see OLD HELP NOTE 281 of
9/23 labeled "no erase" for a previous discussion of
this. The system variable "where" is not updated by
as -erase- command; it seems to me that it SHOULD be,
but of course the possible impact on existing lessons
must be considered. As regards a full screen erase,
that has generally been regarded as a point of re-
starting things, which would naturally mean being in
write mode--changing this now would seem likely to have
quite a variety of repercussions.

Over two years ago, Bruce Sherwood and I observed that
erase was not updating where, and he wrote a general
note saying that this would be fixed unless he heard
objections regarding existing lessons. To the best
of my recollection, the change was then made.

It would be helpful, if when branching to have as an added
option to -branch- a tag to allow skipping the next n
commands, i.e.

        branch  *+4        $$would branch ahead 4 commands
        branch  *-2        $$would branch back 2 commands
        branch  i=1,*+2,x  $$would branch ahead 2 commands
        at      where      $$ to the -arrow- if i equaled 1
        erase   5          $$and erase if not
        arrow   1812

This would be helpful and more convient than sticking in

This is similar to the "skip" command which was proposed
a long time ago (after someone saw an HP demo). Most of the
arguments against it then were just reiterated by Brand.
Rick Blomme had a couple more which had to do with execution
of the "skip" by the system. Besides the aforementioned
arguments I would like to add, "What about the poor person
who has to try to decipher "skip coding" after you are
gone?"

Amen. Relative addressing of this kind makes for all
kinds of trouble. A different way to get the same thing,
but without these bad side effects, is the IF...THEN...ELSE
kinds of constructions in many languages. So far we have
not spent a lot of effort thinking how to mesh such
constructions with TUTOR, which presently does not have
indentation of lines, a feature almost essential for such
constructions to be really useful.

AMEN2 Tutor is not supposed to develop into an assembler
language. All of the above arguments have been covered
many times in years past with programmer efficiency
studies and such, and in general, the results favor the
use of symbolic labels over relative addresses, and
IF THEN ELSE constructs over labels.

         The closest thing TUTOR has to an IF-THEN-ELSE
is perhaps the construction that is implied by the
simplest forms of sentence judging.
         Thus, the tutor code:
                answer   dog
                write    Very good!
                answer   cat
                write    Excellent!
         has the implied form:
            IF studentans='dog'
             THEN write Very good!
                     judge ok
            ELSE IF studentans='cat'
               THEN write Excellent!
                     judge ok
            ELSE judge no
         An explicit IF-THEN-ELSE might have made
judging more comprehensible for a few special (complex)
examples, but TUTOR's implicit way is superior
in most cases.

  I agree that TUTOR's way is superior as long as one of

question 'What would a certain Dutch programmer

                .
                . (TUTOR statements in _then_ part)

                . (TUTOR statements in _else_ part)

We are aware as you are that there are some severe
problems with ECS. We are experiencing large swings in
ECS usage patterns, and we are seeing more terminals
running in the afternoon. The basic problem is that we are
trying to "give out more ECS than we have", in the sense
that the sum of the individual site allocations is more
than the total amount of ECS available. (The !base"
allocations DO total to the amount available, but the
instantaneous allotments can be higher.) As first aid, we
are running essentially at the base allocations when there
are large numbers of terminals running. We are studying
possible improvements.

I was trying to explain what was happening to someone at our
site, and it seems to me that if I am right it bears repeat-
ing given the widespread confusion.

If the ecs load for the whole system is under 100:, then the
system allows people to use more ecs at their sites than
they are actually guaranteed. Since the system does not
know who is going to jump in and try to use the unused ecs
first, it increases everyones site allotment so that they
all get a shot at it. This works fine if (as Bruce stated)
there are no drastic and rapid swings in the ecs load.
If that does happen, the following occurs...

---------- response 2
  10/07     16.18     deiss       phar

For example if all of a sudden 200 students sit down and
start running lessons to take up the slack in their site's
temporarily large allotment, they quickly take up not
only the ecs their site was guaranteed but the temporary
excess they were allowed as a result of overall system
underload. If a latecomer walks in and signs onto a site
that is not using all of its ecs, he can't delete students
from the ecs they have taken over. Since they were taking
the ecs he was not using in the first place, he may not
even be able to get what he was guaranteed. The only
reasonable solution to the whole dilemma would seem to
be to improve the algorithm that determines when to and
how much ecs to "reallocate" to users above their base
allotments. That's what they are attempting now.

   In case no one has noticed, the positioning and
length of the answer mark-up (like underlining of
mis-spelled words) has been fixed so that it should
be done correctly in almost all cases, including cases
where -bump-s and -put-s have been used.
   Also, the info available via the print directive:
*list info
has been updated so that it includes info recently
added and so that its format and wording corresponds
to that currently used in the editor. (This new version
of the printer may not be in normal use for a few days

When commands are changed by the system, for instance,
the change of start to cstart, no changes are made to
change commands, thus

change start to xyz

is not changed. Shouldn't change command tags be changed
in future system command changes?

Second point: I am now left with a change for a
command "ansva." I can't find from aids what that has
been replaced by. If you don't change change commands,
you should leave the old command in aids with a reference
to the new ones.

Third: I realize that one uses change commands at one's
own risk so I may be asking too much.

It seems to me that either aids should have some method
of getting to the commands, or that the long promised
index to new systems features notes should be finally
be delivered.

Meanwhile, it should not be surprising that authors
rely on the statement in new system features that a
system conversion has been done and do not check
their "finished" lessons.

Pending the development of a fool-proof system change
mechanism, perhaps new systems features notes or aids
should list those instances in which system command
changes fail.

   Use of the -change- command is probably likely to
remain something of a risk to the user when various
system modifications and conversions are made. We
will try to account for some of the simple cases (like
just a command name change) in the future.

One month is too short a time. What happens when somebody

lesson, and tries to look it up on U of I AIDS? There are

It would be best to keep notes on old commands and what

The University administration and the administration of this

minority staff members. Of course not all directors and
department heads are equally devoted to reducing the
disproportionate share of good jobs held by white males, but
the general feeling is one with which you should be
comfortable.

We don't know how to reach minorities! Our efforts have

     It would appear that the point here is minorities
should be hired on the basis of thier being minorities
and not on the basis of thier being competitive for the
job. This seems to be indicated in the response that
there are OJT positions etc. Even OJT positions should
be filled on the basis of competitive selection which
SHOULD NOT be influenced by any other factor but the
individuals ability and desire to work. Reverse
discrimination is just as bad as the original discrimination
and it is sad that the attitude of "we got the short end
before so now its your turn" is so commonly accepted. I
wish people would stop writing these hate letters with no
basis but emotionalism. There are a very few jobs open
on PLATO and it is insane to feel that the employers should

Why isn't there a complement to the -concept- command?
What I mean is that the complement of -ok- is -no- and the
complement of -answer- is -wrong-. But I can't find any
complement to -concept- in aids. Therefore if I want to
use a large vocabulary and respond with a no to a -concept-
I have to stick in a -judge no-. Am I over looking a command
somewhere or is the -judge no- route the only way to have
a wrong concept sort of command?

---------- response 1

You will indeed have to use either a conditional judging
format [eg, judge anscnt,no.no,ok,no,ok,no,no,ok] or
limit your wrong judgments to words or phrases included in
the tag of a wrong command.

It would appear that the concept machinery is set up only
to allow you to categorize complex student responses; the
judging is then left up to you. I agree that a complement
(like -wrongc-) would be nicer.

yes indeed, this is on the list of software jobs needing

we are also exploring the possibility that all the answer

addition of something like "-" modify it to the "NO" form.
e.g.:

answer   cat
answer-  dog
concept  car
concept- boat

I think that learning a name for something whose function
is already familiar is a very easy task. New authors that
I have worked with see immediately that -wrong- and 
-answer- have the same properties.

Different names for the positive and negative of a pair
make for easy reading of code and encourage logical organi-

It would be quite convenient if there was a quick way of
respecifying the location where responses to wrong answers
would begin without having to either put an at in each wrong
group or put in an *ok*,*at*,*judge continue* set. I am
thinking about something like an optional 2nd argument in
the tag of the arrow command. This sort of thing would be
extremely helpful to those of us who attempt to pick up
as many specific wrong answers as possible. It would
probably encourage more specific wrongs to be put in and
would save quite a bit of lesson space (both source and
condensed) through elimination of a lot of *at*s as well
as making it more convenient to use do*ne units to give
similar responses to wrong answers to different arrows.
( know this can be done now by preceding the *do* with
an *at* each place it is used, but it would be easier to
know the *at* was going to be set with a default.)

 I think I have some slight idea of what has caused some
of our ECS problems. This is what happened in 165 ERL
yesterday morning. At 9:00 when some students are arriving
to take a makeup exam, I check ECS and find over 100,000
words. So, even though I know that the exam consists of
several large lessons, I don't cahase out the few miscel-
laneous ( sp? ) students from other courses. However, at
about 9:15 a student gets deleted from his exam. I check
the ECS and find that the allocation is down to 77,000
words, so I chase out everyone except cs103 students, and
everything is fine. Around 9:45, the ECS limit for the site
starts increasing again, so that by about 10:00 it's near
100,000 again. Although I think I understand the algorithm,
I'm suggesting that the ECS limit shouldn't be quite so
responsive to temporary changes in use.

No, that isn't the reason. The increase was do to manual
intervention (mine) but it is adjusted automatically,
we find that the sites do not experience serious difficulties if we gave you a virtually stable allotment it would have
to be near the base allotment, and few would accept that as
an improvement.

I'm not arguing for having only a base allotment. Perhaps
what this is leading me to is a suggestion to include the
base allotement in the site ECS display. Then when I see
use approaching the base allotment, I could start chasing
people out. ???r??? i???c???h

On the option page for option 2 from main page, why not
have the options reached by mnemonic keys (a for add,
i for individual, m for message, etc.)? The option page
from 4 would probably be better organized that way too, but
it is not as likely to be used by an instructor.?
I know you asked us to comment only on the displalys in

There are serious disagreements among different people

From what I have observed out here in the "real world"

While looking at the record of a single student, will the
options there be similar to those available now (data
options, student vars, router vars, etc.)? If so, I
suggest that it be possible to advance from the current
student to the next one in the roster by simply pressing
next1 on any of these pages (rather than having to go
back to the main student display).?
I'm not real sure whether this sample reorganization
would make much difference, except that a few critical
options would now be available with fewer keypresses.?
I would favor mnemonic choice of option selection keys.

I am in disagreement with at least one point of the new
displays. I realize that it is often important to change
a student's password, but it is just as important often
to change that student's name or lesson, and to delete
the student from the course. I would suggest a direct
transfer from the first page to the individual student
data records, rather than a transfer from the second
page. Thus I would strongly suggest altering the
"Change a student's password" option to a
"Change a student's record" option, with provisions
to change name, password, lesson, and even to delete
the record and back out the student.

This new display looks a lot less intimidating to a new

Could the headings for the 2nd page displays be different
from the main options page ("Plato course phys")
like "Special Options for Plato course phys" and
"Information about Students in Plato course phys" ? This
would help us remember where we are. Also, could there
be a message about pressing BACK for the main option page?

I hope that the "Delete a Student" page will emphasize that
this is a permanent deletion from the class roster, rather
than a back-out.

         I like the new course pages and would like to
throw in a few comments.
        1. I like the way the number of choices on the
pages, especially the first, are pared down. I'd like to
see the first page cleaned out even further by removing the
last section on special options. Most teachers I've worked
with will gradually make use of many of the options but in
the beginning are concerned mainly with adding students,
changing passwords, and designing curricula.
        2. Bury the course data page if you even let
instructors see it all. Only a very competent instructor
should be allowed near that page.
        3. Teachers seem to pick up the pattern of letters
of functions fairly rapidly, I'd rather not see that changed
to numbers or alphabet. Thanks

      I like the new format a lot. A new - type person
liked the format much better (and got around within it
easier) than in the present setup.
      I vote no for mnemonic key names - practice has
shown with a lot of people that use options heavily that
a menu - type format is easier to use if it's used a lot,
and a 0-9 / a-z format is certainly no hardship on some-
one who is only an occasional user. There are many of us
out here who have much trouble with mnemonic options pages.

To Warner: I would think that changing a student's name
would be uncommon, and certainly not so time-critical as
clearing a password. Changing a lesson name is VERY far
from what an instructor can do. We intend to bury that
option rather deeply. One of the problems of the present
records editor is the ease with which, by a mistaken key-
press, one can clobber the lesson name in a student's
record.

It is an interesting comment to say that numbers should be
used rather than letters. Should they all be numbers?
There can then be a problem with hitting a number twice and
jumping too fast to the wrong display. What do you think?

Now that's interesting. What if the menu pages alteranted
between numbers and letters. You could never double key
yourself into limbo that way.

I also am opposed to mnemonic selectors: there are too many
things that have the same name (i=inidivual or info,
c=change name or copy record, etc.). Serial selectors
force one's attention to the menu page rather than to one's
memory of an option name that might mean something different
than expected on the current page.

I realize that the purpose of this is to make things

example, I frequently have to switch from one datafile
to another, making the same switch for each of _17_
(count em) courses. It's already a pain; if the data
page is buried any deeper than it is now....!!!!!?
Could you either (1) have two records editors, one for
instructors, another for experienced users; or (2) have
some way of making changes like this (data options would
be another, less important (to me) example) in some bulk

It would seem that not executing a finish unit would be a

who must know whether deletion or stop1 occurred should
probably be asking for no finish unit execution on deletion.?
(Obviously a better solution is for the finish unit to
be able to tell the difference through some system variable.
I haven't had to deal with critical questions on deletions
of students since I have never seen a student deleted from
a lesson, but my recollection is that there is a special
value of errtype for unsuccessful jumpout due to lack of
ECS.)

on the menus, to avoid problems with inadvertant multiple-

I'd like to see the 'copy a record from another course'
on the same page with 'add a student' and 'delete a
student'. An inexperienced TA might well think that
the only way to move a student's record from one course to
another was to delete the original record and create
a new one. (It has happened here.) Also, some
spelling out of the fact that deletion of the record
does indeed mean that all record of what the student
has done will be lost and that he, if he is to continue,
will have to start from scratch would be helpful. It
should be as plain as a pikestaff, but experience has
shown that such is not always the case.

After trying to do things the brute force way with
the pdp11 program we have to take apart output from
the plato line and display it, I tried using a little
sense(?). So I thought lets show the value of the infamous
variable key. 0226 right after the stop and not so
strangely enough 0235 after the pause was broken.
So I remembered what a famous sysprog once said about
the problem of aborting output from a full screen erase
while  loading chars. It nicely tosses in a catchup key
so as not to lose the chars. Therefore the catchup key
comes through after the rest of the output is aborted.

PS the reason for using the 11 program was to check
for the echo that I was sure being sent after
the stop key.

Okay, here is my two cents worth. I for one would like to
see more sites available for authors. I have a sign-on with
Ed at the U of I, but the room and building for that matter
close before I can get to it. I am only a part-time author
which sort of makes me lowly on the priority scale
particularly since I have an affiliation with a college. So
I find it next to impossible to get any work done for the
crowds in 165 CERL (priorities aside the noise level is
to high to think most of the time). I also can't seem to
convince anyone that I could use access to the second floor
author room since I am affiliated with ed and they have
thier own site. More author only rooms so we can work too.
Secondly, I agree that the physical plant is very important
to working with PLATO. The cubicles similar to those used

---------- response 3
  10/12     23.37     lombardo       ed

in language labs would be very useful with PLATO.
Additionally better lighting would help relieve eye strain
and the headache which results from to much PLATO. These
cubicles would serve to soundproof as well as separate
individuals which would be more conducive to work.
I also think that there should be sites located at the
residence halls, and I don't even live in one. This
would provide local availability to maximize the use of
PLATO 24 hours a day. I don't blame anyone without a car
for not wanting to come to CERL at night, I wouldn't! This
forces the individual to make time during the day (usually
prime time) or to not get the work done at all. This would
also help free up the sites now so heavily in use at CERL.
Additionally (wouldn't it be nice to have all this money?)
Uni should have its own site to take care of all of its

It seems rather contradictory to want open author sites for

them. The criteria for who can use what terminals has got

no mental strain on me, but it does tend to get noisy in
165 on weekends and after having taught high school I feel
I can distinguish between high school students goofing
around and high school students devoted to the furtherance
of thier work. Really, I'm not down on Uni, I just
commented on a real problem that does exist and a possible
way to get around it (provided someone dies and leaves

I have a similar problem with the charset loaded in -ants-.
Memory slots 64(space used for animation),74,75,82,83,94,
and probably others have extra dots. I see this on the
-ants- title page (the ant leaves little droppings as he
moves).

However, if I inspect the charset (charcric in file
-cricket-) the dots are there until I pick option 4
(multiple character design) and select these 6 characters.
The actual characters in the lower right corner still show
the extra dots, but the big grid does not. When I press
"i" now, the characters in the corner DON'T have the dots!
And when I go into -ants- again, the ant droppings are gone.
This is why I don't think it's a problem with my terminal.

No other charset does this to me. (It is an old charset,
now 1 block but originally 2 blocks in the old days.)

As was said previously the problem IS in your R/W
characrter memory. The reason those dots don't appear
in the charset editor is that the i option actually
goes and creates those dots from your unformatted char.
Hence the dots are not in the charset otherwise they
would appear there and in the large grid which is
created the same way.

Access to data on site terminal usage has been provided
for the past 1 1/2 years in lesson "terminal" as a general
service to users. Because of one or more complaints about
invasion of individual privacy, all access to individually
identified data was withdrawn last week. Unfortunately,
this general solution appears to work a gross hardship on
many site directors who indicated that they were happy to
have their own data public in return for its availability.
One of these site directors has suggested that public access
be withdrawn only for those who object rather than for all.
This solution seems workable. The lesson has been reopened
temporarily for general inspection. Site directors who
wish identified data from their site not to be shown should

There may be circumstances under which a site will have
very low usage (closed down for the summer, terminal
problems, or critical but low-rate use) but still be
doing valid work. No one but the site director really
knows. We would much rather that anyone feeling
embarassed by low usage (or simply feeling that their usage
was no one's business but theirs) request that their data
not be shown rather than feel obligated to inflate their
data by keeping empty terminals signed on. At the same time,
many site directors have indicated that knowing usage for
sites similar to their own is very beneficial in making
planning estimates. It is currently a fact of life that
some sites with less than 40 (or even 4) hours of use per
week are doing significant work.

---------- response 3
  10/14     03.15     sellers       arizona

If the reason that an individual wants to take a terminal
off is because of low useage, then he is taking it off for
the wrong reasons.

Anyone who interperats the low usage as bad without
knowing the real situation is not worth bothering about.

On the other hand, a person who wants the terminal taken
off has a right, in as far as he doesn't deprive others
of useful information in regard to their own sites,to do so.
The comparison of the various usages is useful information.
I use comparisons in demos from time to time. I would like
to tell my demoees that the information is complete.

If the terminals in question are associated with an
individual person I would like to see his personal rights
protected. If the terminals belong to an organization,
then I think that free access to the information about
the terminals would be the safest general policy.

Not possible. The NEXT1 feature from the condense error
page works only because the condensor has available the
uncondensed source code (with block divisions, continued
commands, comments, etc.) and hence can refer you to the
proper place in case of error. This information is then
thrown away while the lesson executes. Thus, when an exec
error takes place, PLATO can tell you the unit, and the
approximate position of the command in the unit (barring
certain quirks), but cannot find the block the unit is in
or the actual line number of the error in the source code.

How can I insert a character block between two other
blocks in a lesson. When I tried the shifted letter
of the block after which I wanted to insert it, the
character block ended up at the end.

     This process is done also with common blocks.
     If you want your char block in between some
     blocks, create the block, and then transfer
     the other blocks behind it. Kinda
     -kludge-y, yet it works.

WHY do you want to put the charset block right in the middle
of the lesson?

   The charset will work anywhere in your lesson. There
really isn't any need to put it in the middle.....

It helps at times to have the charset block near the code
that uses it.¬ If you like it¬ this way(and you have enough
extra blocks,) you can create a copy block where you want
the charset block, press next(to copy from the lesson you
are editing,) and copy the charset block into its new lo-
cation. This saves¬ time(and errors)¬ compared to moving all
the¬ other¬ blocks behind it. This is also helpful in the
case of micro blocks. Naturally you delete the old block
after it is copied.

---------- response 6
  10/14     10.28     friedman       csa
It's true that commons, charsets, etc. work no matter
where they are put in a lesson, but it's also true that
a lesson author can have a legitimate need to put them
somewhere other than at the end of the lesson. The
most annoying example of this is an attempt to keep a
library of assorted kinds of blocks (see cslibrary for
the one I have in mind). Here, it's important to have
blocks which are logically related to each other, close to
each other, so that the prospective user discovers them
all. I won't tell you how much of a pain it was getting
cslibrary's blocks into the order they are in.....?
How about the editor letting us organize things the way
the author wants? You can still put the blocks physically
at the end, without insisting they also go logically at the
end. PLEASE, Dave?

When the new SD and ID or whatever you people have decided
on gets put on the system , would it be to much trouble if
you could incorperate into the recalc of the f and g keys
(used for fine and gross grid coordinates) a shifted F and
G key to give coordinates based on your "at" or origin.

  Would be real handy for use with the rdraw and graphs.

The way it stands now if you want to find a given point on
a drawing which uses an "at" or origin to plot a display you
have to add , subtract and so on which can be a bit of a
bother........esp. for those who know modern math only.

it becomes a tedious task.

If you look at the help pages for -editcom-, you will
find that if you include any one of the letters "o,a,i,f"
it changes the format of the display to those types.
Therefore, the "o" that you typed to indicate octal
was instead taken to mean "change to octal display"
I guess you'll have to stick with term -calc-....

WHO: Sharon Hunnicutt?
Sharon Hunnicutt is working with John Allen at MIT in the
development of a synthetic speech system. The group has
developed a text-to-speech system which, for a piece of
unrestricted text, can decompose words and consult an 11000
entry morph lexicon or else employ a grapheme-to-phoneme
and stress production algorithm, and generate synthetic
speech.

Ms. Hunnicutt will discuss the nature of the group's work
and play a demonstration tape.

with PLATO so that 'speech' commmands can be sent digitally
to an audio synthesizer at the terminal.

We have a brand new custom built ECS polling routine
to give us some long term data on our usage, so it must
stay in all day. Well it seems a waste to have this
terminal sitting here all day when we could put it to
other use. So while the program was running we unplugged
the terminal from the site controller and moved it to
one of the left-over ports. Now I am using the terminal
(now on another station number) for other things, and can
even monitor the polling program !! This is essentially
the same thing the systems people have with their
"non-hardware terminals". Could _we_ have a way to
do this without moving the wires around?
  Of course if people were so inclined they could run their
high cpu programs this way, and help run up the number of
terminals in use. We would need to discuss the allocation
of the extra terminals.

This is really an option available only to about a half

The recently announced -atno- command has not yet been
made embeddable. In reviewing this, a strong preference
has developed that the name be changed to -atnm-. There
are other commands (such as -arrow-) that we might want
to treat in the same way--and -arrowno- will not have any
reasonable connotations. The "nm" is for "no margin".

Our plans would then be to change this command name from
-atno- to -atnm-, and make the -atnm- command embeddable.
The convertion is a standard type that should cause no
trouble (we can even try to take care of change commands).
Please register any complaints about this here!

talking about command names --- there are all kinds of
problems remembering the -backgnd- ¬+ -foregnd- command
names as well as others. what about these changes:

backgnd  ¬D  bground
foregnd  ¬D  fground
findl    ¬D  findlst (like addlst)
removl   ¬D  removel
lname    ¬D  lesname

there are many, many other problems. some can only be
solved with a longer command field. i believe it is better
to type a longer command name, than to have some abbreviated
name only a few people can relate to.

why limit the command to only 8 characters?

---------- response 2
  10/16     11.00     b sherwood       s

There are good technical reasons for limiting the
command name to 7 characters, except where there is no
tag (-endarrow-). I agree with you on favoring long
names for readability and rememberability. Since you work
on aids all the time, you are in a specially good position
to suggest better names. Do you have some to add to
the list just given?

---------- response 3
  10/16     11.58     friedman       csa

If you change SOME of the leslist commands (-addl-, et al),
please change them ALL in a SYSTEMATIC way; e.g., convert
"l" to "lst" in -findl-, -removl-, and any others hanging
around (I can't think of any others at this moment).
I, for one, would not have any particular objections to
the changes Jim G. suggests, except for -removl-, for
which I think the ending should be the same as the ending
for -addl- and -findl-. Unfortunately, if the new ending
is to be "lst", -removlst- is too long. Perhaps either
delete the letter "o", or shorten "lst".

I much prefer -atnm- to -atno-. In addition to the changes

The condensor looks only at the first 8 characters in
order to determine the command name. And 8 or more
characters also runs into the tag field whose beginning
is defined by the TAB key.

The reason why the condensor looks only at the first
8 characters is to make condensing go faster.

PLATO has been forgetting to send full screen erases again.
This happens:

    1)at all times of the day
    2)in all lessons (system or otherwise)
    3)at all terminals
    4)without any red lights.

The terminals do NOT freeze up or anything. The screen
simply fails to erase. This happens at least five or six
times a day, and in some cases is an intolerable incon-
venience.

---------- response 1
  10/16     14.19     rader       s

To my knowledge this is always a hardware problem, with
the terminal itself--if you try several terminals in the
same overheated room, you can easily get the same results.

To put it another way, if you press the white "clear"
button and the problem goes away, then it is the terminal
that is at fault.
---------- response 2

Then what you are saying is that if pressing the white
clear button clears the screen then it is a hardware error,
or "If the terminal works then the terminal doesn't work."

Of course, it took me two tries to read the first
response to this; the first time the terminal dropped
a full screen erase! Its pleasant to know its a
non-repeatable hardware problem. Apparently the
terminals in DCL are suffering from the same disease
as the ones in FLB.

---------- response 4
  10/17     08.45     friedman       csa

I fail to see that the fact that the while switch clears
the screen proves that the dropped erase is the terminal's
fault! (Notice that the problem frequently manifests
itself as a SINGLE dropped erase, not a long string of
them.) The same symptoms would be observed of it is the
fault of the software, i.e., if the erase signal had never
been sent to the terminal! It may in fact always be the
terminal's fault; I don't know, and I presume that's the
purpose of this exchange; but the statement given is faulty
logic. Now, I can see the logic of this if the terminal
repeatedly fails to erase UNTIL the white switch is
pressed; but like I said, that's not always the case--
it frequently is just a single missed erase, after which
further erases work fine with no use of the white switch.

---------- response 5
  10/17     10.48     rader       s

It appears that a more precise specification of symptoms
is needed--I have never seen the single dropped full screen
erase problem, and assumed that the problem of the terminal
stopping all full screen erases was being discussed. In
that case, my previous comments apply.

If the problem is occasional dropping of full screen
erases (and only full screen erases), all I can say is
that we will have to see the problem before we can fix
it. If you think you have a persistent case, or some
evidence as to the nature of the problem, please let us
know.--Are there some programs in which it is more
frequent? Some sites? Some terminals? The statement
that it is system wide cannot be true, 'cause I haven't
seen it!

Has any more consideration been given to a -writer- command
which would write a student record onto disk? A true stroy:

The Modern Hebrew project uses 50 router variables to keep
track of student scores on exercises and tests. These are
stored as segmented variables in such a way as to allow for
several units. It became apparent tonight (with a student
execution error) that the segments need be smaller; however,
this is not an easy thing to change. There are Hebrew stu-
dents in 10 courses, whose router variables would all have
to be changed. A -writer- command would make writing a 
program to do this conversion trivial; without it, the
task is gargantuous.

---------- response 2
  10/17     08.51     friedman       csa
Rick, I have a suggestion. I have found that from time
to time, I need to change some define in my order
variables, without disturbing the proper functioning of
a student record that is using the old defines. So I
store, in the one never-changed definition (a few bits in
nr1) what I call a "version number". Then the router
contains code to check the version ¬$, and convert to a
new version if an old version is detected. So far, my
conversions have involved only a few lines of code, so
the size of my router has not increased significantly.
This means that when I change my defines, I change my
verson number, and put the conversion in the router. The
main disadvantage, of course, is that this code stays in
the router over a long period of time.

I'm afraid that only a -writer- command will allow
non-system routers to make it possible for teachers
to prescribe individualized curricula for students
in much the same way that the system now does. In order 
to meet these needs, the only practical way of handling
it is to be able to alter router bank and the student
restart information. The purpose of writing non-system
routers is to gain flexibility, not lose it. Elaborate,
error-prone procedures involving version updates, override
flags and tree structures located in common and datasets
have been developed to circumvent the system's failure
to simplify an unnecessarily complex problem.

Why so much trouble? Is their a certain time in the month

 that thay can't locate a problem quickly? Its all very
strange to me. And what is worse it's all very strange to
the student who gets knocked out of a lesson before he can
finish it. This is all very distressing, especially to a

You have been unfortunate enough to be "new" at a
particularly bad time. When there is an error in the
system which causes crashes, it is not unusual for
the system to crash several times in succession until
the error is corrected.

Yes, I guess you might say the system is so vast that
finding an error takes a lot of time. After all, with
thousands of hours of use behind us, most of the "easy"
bugs have been found and corrected.

Errors which are listed as "unknown" in lesson crash
are changed to show the actual reason for the failure
when (and if) that reason is discovered.

---------- response 2

Just be thankful that people are honest enough to say
UK, rather than attributing them all to whatever the
current bogeyman happens to be. It would be so easy
to have all crashes attributed to, for example, ECS
failures, and noone would ever look for the real cause.
I have seen systems where there have been persistent
errors for periods of over a year, because both the
hardware and the software personnel spent more time
pointing the finger at the other group than they did
trying to fix the errors that were there. Saying a
crash is unexplained is at least an indication that
someone still has an open mind.

     An interesting feature of the M option:
        (Did you know that shift-shift-b is b?)
        (now there is not only next and next1, but next2)

        When replacing "l" by"L", I
pressed "M" once too often, and it seemed that it had not
done anything. However, I soon noticed that the "l"
was alternately "L" and "L". I thought this was strange,
until I noticed that after 10 such switches the word count
of the line went up by 1. This meant that my innocent
little "l" was really shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-shift-
shift-shift-shift-shift-l (-l10-). This, of course, is
relatively easy to not notice, and might possibly cause
some problems.

---------- response 1

That is because the pattern which your M option replaces
is still in the string you are replacing. A trick you
can use this for is to replace "o0" with "o" in char
commands. Do this repeatedly until all "o0"s are gone.
Then replace all "o," with "0,", and then make sure
that the last number in the char is not ",o", if so...
edit this to ",0" in replace mode.

da da! you now have saved some space in storing this char!

---------- response 2

I can see where the "l" ¬D "L" could cause problems, but
I don't see any easy way around it.

By the way, not only is shift-shift-l just "l", but
similarly access-access-a is just "a" and not "¬a".
(MICRO-MICRO-a will be ¬a because the 1st MICRO is ignored,
but 0767601 entered either as an octal string or by
hitting shift-square will be just "a".)

Of course, you can get "l10" in half the time if you
use the SHIFT1 key (which is what you press in order to
access SHIFT-TERM -- gotten by holding down a shift key
and pressing the other shift key.....)

I'm sorry, I couldn't resist it.

       Your exponentiation is causing the trouble. If
you write this expression as:

(0777$cls$9)$diff$0777777777

        You will get the expected number. The calc
compiler automatically normalizes cases involving exponents,
so you'll have to rely on the shifting operations to
accomplish bit manipulations. Such is life on a floating
point machine.

(Note that 2?9?? alone is an integer. Operating on this
quantity forces the normalize.)

---------- response 3
  10/17     20.04     ian       cs425

        The point was the the floating point normalization
was _not_ done on (0777#29) as a stand-alone expression,
but _was_ done when it was used as a component of a
more complicated expression. One of the minimal
constraints on any computer should be that equal
quantities can be substituted without any discernable
effect. In this case, there is apparently an invisible
temporary variable being used, with an implicit conversion
taking place.It is incredibly difficult to debug anything
when a component of an expression changes form in a
manner like that. If (0777#29) was displayed as
a floating point variable, the error would have been
nowhere near as mysterious as it actually turned out
to be.

If you do bit manipulations, use $cls$ and $ars$ to
shift things, not multiplication or division by 2N.

Basically, TUTOR handles exponentiation thru floating-point
arithmetic. For part of the reason why this is, consider
2n1, where at execution time n1 might have the value -3.
TUTOR will correctly compute 2-3, or 0.125. Note that
many computer languages would give 0, or some such
inappropriate result.

A couple questions about the new editor features:

  a) Since I would think that most of us agree that
the new options are worth saving, could you give us any
idea of what you would consider an overload of disk
accesses? How muh cautin and restrain should we use
on those features?

  b) Any idea of how long the usage will be tested
before a final decision is made about the premament
implementation of these features (I would assume the
part-indicator will be permament..I'm talking about the
new search features (known as the Y-search))?

   In closing. THANKS FOR THE NEW FEATURES!!!!!!!!!!!!!

One question. How does one stop a search once it has
started (or is this possible). I have found that stop1 will
work sometimes but that is dangerous due to condensing
problems. Other than that, I think it is a much better
system.

THANKS FOR ALL THE NEW FEATURES!!!!!

i noticed this only happened after all occurrences in
the PRESENT block were exhausted ... the search then moved
on to the FIRST occurence in the NEXT block, which one
used to initiate himself utilizing NEXT1 ... -search- just
does it for you ... you can always change the "M" option
or kill it, after noticing that the -search- has jumped you
a block ...

However, to cause an extra disk access to save you time
and sometimes find that you dont want to go to the next
block is somewhat wasteful. I vote with silver.
(or perhaps does the system load more than one block at
any one time? Such as the next1 and back1 blocks?)

I vote with how do we know, when you hit NEXT1, whether
you want to go to the next block (as is currently the
case) or want to start a whole-lesson search? Or do you
want NEXT1 to activate the whole-lesson search someplace
other than the normal block editing display?

   Never has a search of any type worked that way, and
frankly, I'm glad for that feature...although I myself
have tried to do that same braino, when it says "not
found" and I KNOW it exists, I can conclude from all
this data that I've gathered, that it is currently at
the top line, which is indeed the case. Then I get to
go, "You dumb clown!! Blind while at the terminal, eh?".
Anything else? Frankly, I'm not too worried about the
refinements right now...I'm just thankful we have the
features, and want to make sure we CONTINUE to have them!

The important thing, I think, is that you not program in a
way that depends on these features every time you edit. i.e.
don't start scattering units in any old place and then have
to use a lesson-wide search to find them. The lesson
structure and the block names should still be your main
aid in finding sections of code.

---------- response 13
  10/22     08.16     mike b       cornell

        Good! If that's all there is to it, there won't be
any problem. You'd have to have the patience of Job to use
the new search every time you needed to find a unit, since
it is inevitably rather slow (compared to the flying fingers
of an editor who knows where his units are). The feature
is great for the exceptional case (or editing late at night
when your mind is zonked anyway), but I don't think there
will be any utilization problems.

It has been brought to my attention that some of the char-

Character Design Contest would possibly be wanted by those

There is a giant ape of excellent proportion and most nasty

  10/20     10.08     mike b       cornell

        I think it's time to revive the debate over changes
to -term- talk. There has been plenty of talk in the past
about how frivolous talks were annoying while people are
working, but how nobody wants to miss an important talk
by turning off his/her talk option, or -term- rejecting.
I suggest that a simple solution would be the following:
Add to the -talk- the option to send a brief message along
with the page. So that if I had to talk to somebody about
an exec error in their lesson, he might see: "talk: mike b/
cornell: exec error in you lesson." He would, of course,
probably want to answer such a page. On the other hand,
something like "talk: mike b/cornell: how's you mother?"
might well be ignored by a busy author. Even better than
ignoring it, however, would be -term- busy to replace the
jolting -term- reject. Any comments?

  10/20     10.32     berger       mfl

And there's no problem with TERM reject other than the
fact that too many people take it personally, when it
only indicates that the person is busy.

If people stopped taking "rejected" as something per-
sonally, there would be no need to change the (accurate)
message.

---------- response 3
  10/20     10.44     mike b       cornell
 
        But that still doesn't solve the problem of missing
talks you might want to get, even though busy.

        As for the sort of messages mentioned in the first
response, I would point out that it is easy enough to ig-
nore a page like that (it has no effect on the paged per-
son's processing), while it is somewhat harder to abruptly
end a talk--especially if the pager is suffering only from
mis-placed friendliness, rather than malice.

I for one vote that the 'rejected' message be changed to
something less drastic!
        Or, as an alternative, maybe the pagee could be
allowed to type in a 20 char (arbitrary) message to the
effect of 'busy now send pnote', or any message that
the pagee would deem appropriate for the pager to see.

I think it would be a great idea to have some sort of
short message ability when trying to contact someone
via term talk. The point is well taken that frequently
an author is too busy to sit and write to friends, not
because he doesn't want to talk, but because he has to
get some work done.
The very problem he is working on however could be the
subject of the talk request. A short optional note would
be most helpful to all concerned, as well as a short
note of explanation why the contact cannot be established.

WHO: Sharon Hunnicutt?
Sharon Hunnicutt is working with John Allen at MIT in the
development of a synthetic speech system. The group has
developed a text-to-speech system which, for a piece of
unrestricted text, can decompose words and consult an 11000
entry morph lexicon or else employ a grapheme-to-phoneme
and stress production algorithm, and generate synthetic
speech.

Ms. Hunnicutt will discuss the nature of the group's work
and play a demonstration tape.

One of the goals of the group is make the sytem compatible
with PLATO so that 'speech' commands can be sent digitally
to an audio synthesizer at the terminal.

writec critter,meow.,bowwow.,mooo.
?which could be replaced with?
write No, a ¬oc,critter,cat,dog,cow¬1 goes ¬0c,critter,meow,
      bowwow,mooo¬1.

This would be ESPECIALLY handy in cases where the write
is a response to an incorrect answer, and isn't erased
correctly if separate write's and writec's are used.
Is something like this possible?

Continuing the note now in old general:?
PLATO is missing full screen erases. This has happened
to me at CERL, FLB and the med site (the only places I
work), and most often in the editor (where I spend most of
my time on PLATO). This missed full screen erase is _NOT_
the hardware problem whereby a terminal freezes and the
clear key must be pressed. A page is simply overwritten
by a new one in places where such things should not happen.
I am not alone in experiencing this (I am told it happens
in "notes" a lot), and it happens too frequently and without
warning too pin down any pattern. However, the most recent
occurrence for me was when I hit "+" on the main editor
page and got part 3 written on top of part 2.
Once again: this is NOT specific to any terminal or site;
the terminal does NOT freeze until the clear key is hit.

It would be nice to have a command in the editor that
allows you to load a micro table (and perhaps a charset).
This is useful if you are entering font characters for
which there is a microtable, like some of the CS charsets.
Perhaps a T command? It could work like the editor in

I hope you are aware that you can hit "C" and "M" on
the author mode page to load -charset- and -micro-s.

I would like to be able to specify in my lesson directory
(or some such place)-- "when I am editting this lesson,
I want microtable 'suchandsuch' to be active".

---------- response 2
  10/21     03.46     koning       csstaff

   Yes I know about the C and M features. They are nice but
while editing something more flexible is often needed.
I like the idea of an automatic microtable specified in the
lesson data (with an automatic charset as a matching
feature) but there are cases when one wants to switch
between 2 microtables while editing a lesson. Example:
while editing a CS lesson I need microtable 'key' for the
keytop characters and table 'big' for the block capital
letters. Having to switch between them by backing out to
the author mode page and using the M feature is kind of
painful. In short, I would like to see this implemented.
It should be pretty simple, one would guess.

---------- response 3
  10/21     04.18     midden       p

Most things are fairly simple to implement. Considerable
thought is usually given before something is done, though.
That explains the saying, "that'll take at least six months
before it's even considered" from some users. Automatic
loading of microtables upon editing a lesson has a somewhat
lower priority on lists of things to be done someday. There
are many other things that will be done first.

Character sets? Hummmm...
Marshall Midden

---------- response 4
  10/21     08.39     judy       pso

No, NO! I would much rather have automatic loading of
microtables, than of charsets. After all, once the
charset is in your terminal, it stays there until you
load something else on top of it. But the microtable
specification gets lost each time you change from
author mode to student mode--which can be a dozen times
in an hour.

I think automatic loading of charsets should be viewed
with great caution. Consider... you have loaded a
charset for editting, then you look in aids which uses
maybe two characters for illustrating some point, then
you return to edit, and you get the whole set reloaded.
Of course, you can press STOP and kill the loading, but
you would have to kill the loading each time you changed

Perhaps the answer would be a mixture of the two options
that would work somewhat similar to any other temporary
systems records. During the time a person is on the system,
one may set a charset or micro-table to be loaded for the
editing process. Then, when sign-off has occured, or when
the person indicates no further need for the feature, it
will be cleared. This would decrease the unnecessary
loading of both the micro and the charset but would allow
use of the feature.

---------- note 97 M option
  10/21     11.49     iezek       ames

The new M option (where after all occurances in the block
have been exhausted the press of next does not get the
familiar "not found" but instead initiates the full lesson
search, perhaps jumping one into some other block) is
unwieldy. I use to count on the not found to tell me
when all occurances in the block were found. (Makes sense,
doesn't it?) Now these unnecessary searches.

        It appears strange that so much worry was expressed
that the full lesson search should not be used unnecessarily
and yet full lesson searches that are completely undesired
are foisted upon us by this M option.

        I also know that this has been discussed before,
with little accomplished. Perhaps some change could be
made in the function keys pressed to use this M option.

This question is also discussed in note 29.

My vote is that something a little more drastic than
NEXT should be required to initiate possibly many
disk accesses. Similarly, NEXT1 and BACK1 are too little
to switch between blocks.

Suggestion:
        Next block: CR, NEXT
       Previous block: shift-?, NEXT
          (The keys at the left are already used to move
          around in text. CR and shift-? could echo as
          "next blk" and "prev blk", respectively.)

I agree with the last note. Upon finishing the modify

a SHIFT NEXT set it to go thru entire lesson. It would
then be more like the x (next) search of a block and the
X (shift next) for search of the lesson.

An addition to darlene's scheme of things...
While pressing NEXT or NEXT1 would initiate a single block
or whole lesson search, it would be handy to:

1. Press NEXT for single block search/modify.
2. Cycle through all occurrences in that block, eventually
   getting the "not found" message.
3. Have the option THEN of pressing NEXT1 to expand search
   to the entire lesson, if desired.

especially when I am frustrated by an exceptionally
slow system. So I wouldn't be in favor of fay's sug-

       But darlene's idea shines! This would also
prevent me from pressing BACK instead of NEXT at the
second arrow of the "m" option, assume that BACK was
a -jkey- and that the string to modify _to_ was set,
and wind up with garbage. First satisfying both ar-
rows with NEXT presses and then being given a choice
of NEXT or SHIFT-NEXT would solve these mishaps!

A better suggestion. Most of us automatically hit the

If everybody, systems people especially, conditions them-

   This early morning I saw a new version of the dropped
erase problem that may help to clarify matters.
It seems to be that at least some people think that it is
a software problem. But I noticed a dropped erase during
the preventive maintenance period (in the display "plato is
down for preventive maintenance... This is a recording...").
That just can't be software... So it's either in the
terminal, the transmission lines or in the central hardware.

Two questions regarding leslists:

The "universal" variable jumpout was put on the "obsolete"
list because we were told that we would be able to attach
as many leslists as we wanted.

The "aids" description of leslists now tells us that we
may only attach one (although this MAY change someday).

In light of this, can we have the variable "jumpout" and
variable "from" removed from the "obsolete" list?

Secondly, how about an optional third tag for the leslist
command to allow a codeword check: this would eliminate
the necessity of having the common codewords match in
utility type lessons.

I agree that it is time to get off of the pot on this one.
Some decisions need to be made one way or the other.
I hope some way is found to accomadate those who note
that the leslist feature doesn't provide all the
capabilities of the previous methods. If variable
jumpouts are definitely on the way out, then set a
date when they won't work at all--hopefully not before
the end of the term. The present system simply encourages
the authoring of more obsolete lessons since people
really don't take the obsolete notice seriously any more--

talk just to erase left overs (talk:name end of talk)
but that erased the bottom 3 (or was it 4) lines of
the screen and took some of the display with it. So i
had to go through the lesson again to get the cummulative
display back where it should be for photographing. To get
to the point, can you please erase the talk message
from the receivers screen when he/she chooses not to answer?
Or was it not erased due to our infamous phone line error?

     When trying to reply to Help note ¬$565, I found to my
amazement that rather than the usual space of 100 for the
note, I only got 37... I could only put in 6 lines. It was
not in the text because I cleared the note and saw
"SPACE 37". It is not because the notes space is full be-

Were you trying to modify an answer which you had entered

the notes file between your two entries, then you only
get as many words as your original response.

No, it was a new reply, and besides what you suggest is not
true; I have changed (added to) notes before and never found
that it only gives me the amount used rather than 100.

For another example of that, look at note ¬$186, which has

that this paragraph was added later also....¬??===P¬=??K

if additional notes are added between the time you
enter the note and the time re-enter and try to
change it you will get only the space your original note

  I would like, for the sake of my children's children,
to request that a change be made in the function of the
function keys on the author mode page so that they better
approximate their names. ie:
DATA     inspect a program
SHIFT DATA inspect last block edited
LAB          try cut lesson

Other advantages: The old problem of doing a SHIFT DATA
by mistake would disappear. LAB would be consistant with
the present SHIFT LAB to try out a lesson already in
ECS (if present) from inspecting/editing a lesson.

It has been my experience that once I have read a
'new' p-note (ie, one I haven't seen before), the marker
on the author page disappears. But in this case it
appeared three times when I had received no notes, and
had none in my file. On these three occassions, I had
just signed in, and each time after I attempted to read
my notes, the marker disappeared.
It shouldn't say I have notes when I don't, should

When the system crashes, your records have not been returned
to disc, as is what happens when you sign off via stop1.
Therefore, the system still thinks that you haven't seen

This _did_ occur quite frequently a while back. The
explanation was that, while you are meditating about your
condense error page, there is no "student" in your lesson.
Hence it is eligible for deletion to make more space in
ECS. When ECS was very full, the deletion routine was so
busy deleting things that your lesson got deleted before
your ever got to it.

This was fixed..... your lesson is not deleted while you
are on the condense error page.

I expect what you saw (in non-prime time, I notice) was
just a temporary aberration.

I disagree, Judy, based on my own recent experiences. On
several occasions during prime time this week, I have had
my lesson deleted from ECS before I could hit NEXT from
the condense error page. That is, I had errors which were
known to me already, so I spent X time (X¬<1 sec) looking
at the error page. Still got deleted several times.

"future generations of PLATO users" will have the benefit of
a large accumulation on empirical information about the

interest in you Fiat for sale, this note--if it belongs

Since I still haven't received a system response, and
it is quite important to me, I have re-entered this note:

Two questions regarding leslists:

The "universal" variable jumpout was put on the "obsolete"
list because we were told that we would be able to attach
as many leslists as we wanted.

The "aids" description of leslists now tells us that we
may only attach one (although this MAY change someday).

In light of this, can we have the variable "jumpout" and
variable "from" removed from the "obsolete" list?

Secondly, how about an optional third tag for the leslist
command to allow a codeword check: this would eliminate
the necessity of having the common codewords match in
utility type lessons.

Wouldn't it be nice if the system could use some of

a file which would let us know for any block of code,

Another nice feature would be a service which would
automatically -- overnight -- change all names of
references to a lesson when the name of the lesson
was changed.

author or put the info in help-notes.

How many times have you just ignored the exec error just
because it was a pain to hand copy all that info and then
type it in again?

How often have you, as an author, gotten a note about an
exec error in one of your lessons, and there is not enough
info given to track it down?

How about an option to do an S like in the editor, on the

The introduction of accounts allows those privledged persons

This feature has potential hazards when requesting status

check the status, the search for the lesson will not be
performed. I suggest that the status search be performed

I doubt very seriously that account directors are going
to start playing games with lesson names, sizes, etc...
Account directors should always let interested parties
know what they might be doing to a lesson and in most
cases I would hope that account directors do nothing
unless asked by an author. The whole reason for setting
up accounts was to 1) give greater control to authors to
set up lessons quickly, etc... 2) to take some of the
load off of sheila and other members of PSO 3) to give
another classification to lessons. (maybe there are some
good system reasons also!) I do not believe that account
directors are going to start making arbitrary decisions
about other peoples lessons. They should merely accept
requests from authors as PSO did.
There should be no problems as you described because lesson
names, etc., should only be changed at the author's request.

As far as I can tell the reason for lesson dependency is to
to insure that the searcher gets feedback about the
correctness of the lesson name he entered. Am I correct
about this system persons?

This being the case and assuming the change is easy to make,
the best approach would be to go ahead and make the search
but inform the searcher if the lesson does not exist, or
inform the searcher that the lesson doesn't exist and give
him the option of searching anyway.

As for leaving the facility the way it is...I think it
should be improved in some way because in repect to the
present consideration the configuration is not an example of
good programing practice.

I don't see what you guys are griping about. When you
request a printout, a check IS made to see that the
requested lesson exists. It should be a rare event
for a lesson name to be changed, or the lesson to be
destroyed, between request time and printout time,
For that rare event, would you really have them create
a lot of cumbersome machinery to search the account
log to see why the lesson name has disappeared? I don't
see that it would be worth it. Or are you saying you
don't trust your account director? If that's true, you
are in a very bad way.

---------- response 4

A)  Account directors and other users of the account lessons
    are solely responsible for remaining enough in touch
    with each other's activities to avoid problems like
    those mentioned. I don't think this is a system problem.

B)  There have been a few (stress FEW) cases where a print
    was requested, then the name of the lesson was changed
    (effectively destroyed as far as PLATO is concerned) be-
    for the print was done. Result: the print never gets
    done.

IF a user is requesting a print in order to have documenta-
tion BEFORE making some devastating changes (in the code OR
the name) he/she should ALWAYS have the print firmly in
hand BEFORE effecting those changes. This "rule of thumb"
has been the norm for as long as I can remember. In this
case it would seem to apply especially well to accounted
lessons.

As Tim has pointed out, people who are asking for prints
when someone is going to change the name of the file are
in trouble--and I don't think it is worth putting in
machinery to tell you that this situation has arisen. For
those who change the name after the print is done, but
want to check the status anyway--I am not too sympathetic.

It is correct that the check could simply be taken out and
let you search for any name, whether the file exists or
not--the current arrangement prevents mistyped names from
generating unwanted searches through the disk files that
keep this information. So which is more prevalent--
mistyped names, or files that have disappeared since
the print request?

Ruth Chabay and I are curious about what use is made of
scores generated by the -score- command. As an example,
in physics "homework problems" are worked for a score, and
the score is part of the student's grade. A physics
"gradebook" (see lesson gradebook for a sample) shows the
student these grades (as well as others). Instructors
using the system router can see scores obtained by students,
but at the moment there is no display for the student to see
his own scores. Should the system router provide this
information to the student? Presumably instrcutors do make
some decisions based on scores, so it seems plausible to
show them to the students, too.

Though I have not been using -score- to generate them, I
think that students ought to be shown their scores when
they complete a quiz, jst as they would get back graded
quizzes, etc. in a "regular" (sorry) course. What is the
value of using -score- for this ? If I am storing a
student's score in,say, a variable defined as "grade",
what would a reason be for using -score- instead of a
-show(a,s,or whatever) grade- ? (or "grade/100" for
percents ?) If there is a reason for using -score-, I cer-

case, I wouldn't want a student to see the score because
it is meaningless to him.

In my lessons which have scores used for grading, the
lesson gives the student his "score" at every place where
points are calculated as well as the total score when
he leaves the lesson. The system router is used to
summarize the data for the instructor.

It all works very well.

In response to hinton, I think the question is
Should the system router show the student his score in
addition to marking lessons completed with a * ? This
could remind the student of his relative strengths and
weaknesses. There might be occasions where the student
would be allowed to re-do a lesson to improve his "score".

In reference to the question as to whether or not
the system router should also display scores, I believe
that the instructor setting up the router should
be the one to decide whether the scores should be
shown. I would hate to have to have the score shown
in all cases.

Well, I wasn't thinking that the sysrouter should auto-
matically display scores: they might be meaningless in a
"raw" state: or *lscore* might be used for some purpose
not immeidately evident to the student. What I meant was
that when a student takes a "test", "quiz", or other formal
examination of some kind, he ought to be told how he did: it
just sems like good teaching.

---------- response 7
  10/26     21.33     b sherwood       s

Agreed. We assumed that of course any lesson would show
the student how he was doing. We were asking only about
displaying scores stored for long times.

---------- response 8
  10/27     08.58     friedman       csa

The cs router also accepts and stores -lscore- values;
a utility lesson, csrecords, can display this information
to the cs student. It happens that most cs lessons do not
(so far) set -lscore-, but whatever, the student can see
it anytime he wants. (He can see his own info only, of
course.)

---------- response 9
  10/27     09.23     fay       o

I support the idea of making the showing of scores by the
system router an optional arrangement. I, too, sometimes
use the values of -lscore- for purposes other than really
recording a meaningful measure of student performance.

In other words, Bruce and Ruth, the instructor should be
able to turn the "score showing machinery" at will; I would
object, however, if it was one of those infamous "either/or"
decisions which would necessitate re-initializing the router
in order to change the mode of operation.

---------- response 10
  10/27     18.02     michael       english

To be useful at all, you would have to keep a bit string and
let the person who sets up the instructor file (not always
the instructor) specify WHICH lessons in the catalog should
display scores, since the catalog owner would presumably
know which lessons use -score- in that way.

What has developed is that people are using *lscore* to
pass information between lessons/router since the system
has no easy means of providing an argumented jumpout
capability. Perhaps work should be done on this so that
-score- can be used more consistently for its original
purpose.

If there is nothing in the lesson and you go into it
you use all the processing for the overhead of the
timeslice but it is ended immediately since there
is no code to execute, i.e. lots of processing for a

An interesting glitch observed in embedded sizing.
The following code:

write   Therefore, although our relative pronoun
        will still be masculine in gender and
        singular in number,¬0size,1¬1 it will have to be

condensed normally through the end of the line containing
the first of the embedded size commands. The following
lines, however, appeared two lines higher than they should
have, overwriting that part of the text. As this occurred
on a Sunday, it may simply have been due to a fault in
the running version of PLATO. But it seemed to me
to be a serious enough problem to warrant inclusion

Why is -TERM- cursor 1 dot off in fine grid?

I would like to change the interpretation of "+" and "-"
during word-type answer judging (via commands like -answer-)
Currently, when "+" or "-" occur within a word...they
are illegal during condense time for authors and treated
as punctuations for students (i.e., "Anglo-American" just
become two words).
I would like to make "+" and "-" behave as legal "letter-
like" characters for both author and student for this case
in which they occur _within_ a word (an entity starting with
a letter). Thus, hyphens will become legal input for authors
and code into a one-word entity. Thus, "Anglo-American"
and "Ag+" will be legal one word entities.
However, this means that authors who "handle" hyphenated
cases by just including two words (or by making a phrase out
of them)...will have to re-do these commands to put in
the hyphen.
OK?

In teaching the Computer Science courses on Plato, we have
felt the need for an instructor-to-student communication
system similar in concept to a Bulletin Board: a means
of leaving messages for a more-or-less long period (more
than one signon), addressed to the entire class. For
example, these would include notices of upcoming exams,
announcement of unusual Plato down times, etc.?
An attempt to fill this need is now available in lessons
csmsg1 and csmsg2. Lesson csmsg1 will be accessible by a
single keypress within the cs router; it displays the
notices to the student, based on his signon course. (If
his signon course is not known to csmsg1, it asks him
what course he is interested in.) Lesson csmsg2 contains
the same display functions as csmsg1, plus a graphical
editor for creating the messages. (The editor does not
yet include a few intented bells and whistles, but it's
almost complete.)?

To facilitate inspection of the editor, two fictitional
"course" entries have been created named courses "cstest"
and "sample". "cstest" contains a few examples of what
the editor is capable of. Interested persons are invited
to edit messages for course "sample", as long as common
holds out; its editing security code is "tryit".?

When writing a group of related lessons, especially

desirable to have an answer to the question "how many
users are currently in lesson _x_". Now, I know that the
"usersin" system variable can tell me how many users there
are in the lesson I am executing, but I need other lessons
at the same time. Also, I know how to do this myself by
putting a suitable counter in the shared common, but this
is subject to "ghost" errors (e.g., if a user leaves the
lesson by an execution error), and it does take up a fair
bit of code--in each lesson. Could we have a system means
of determining either the number of users in all lessons
sharing a common, or the number of users in a lesson
whose name is supplied--say as the tag of a "usersin"

The illegal (unfortunately) use of the ¬, symbol in the
tag of an -exactc- command used to be flagged as a
condense error. On today's prime time version (10/27),
it no longer causes a condense error, but does cause the
-exactc- to reject any and all answers. If it is not
possible to make the ¬, legal for all conditional statements,
It's use of should at least be flagged as a condense error,
as this could be a difficult debugger for a new programmer.

    The special delimiter used for -writec- commands
should have its name reduced to "writec delimiter" I
feel. Checking for its mis-use does indeed seem necessary
and appropriate (it does require some special coding to
recognize since it consists of two 6 bit character codes,
one of which by itself is the comma).
   As far as using that delimiter even in -writec-'s, I
might note that using a semicolon or simply an end-of-line
seems simpler and more reasonable. The only case requiring
the use of the special delimiter is that you have entries
containing semi-colons and also ones that take up more
than one line (so that end-of-line cannot be used as
end-of-entry).

I must agree with Judy. The "¬," is the only character on
the keyset that can reasonably be used as a delimiter in
-writec- statements without having to worry about needing
to use punctuation or more than one line. The language-
oriented projects experience this problem the most. It
is regretable that there is no wired-in 6-bit character
expressly for this purpose, but delimiters are such an
artificiality it is hard to remember which are legal in
what commands. The idea of a "universal delimiter" is
basically a sound one, and helpful to both new and ex-
perienced authors. If it is not too difficult, it should
be retained and even expanded.

As a matter of fact, end-of-line is NOT a delimiter for
-writec-, nor should it be; I have coded many -writec-s
in which some or all of the responses were multiple line,
with either commas or ¬,s as delimiters.?
I agree with Judy about the use of ¬, in -writec-s: I use
it habitually because I'm tired of going back and changing
delimiters upon deciding that I now want a comma in one of
the tags. Semicolon is no help; I may decide I want a
semicolon in the middle of a tag.?
I also agree with the desirablity of making ¬, a truly
"universal" delimiter: it ought to be accepted by every
conditional command, at least as an alternative to the
comma or semicolon usually prescribed. For example, it's
a damn nuisance to remember that -block- needs commas and
-transfr- needs semicolons between the principle tags; if
both accepted ¬,....

My current work with punctuation will fix the ¬, problem
in answer judging as a fallout. By the way, there will
still be problems in many commands even when all are fixed
to use the "ununiveral" delimiter...because many commands
need to use two levels of delimiters..e.g., the -answerc-
command currently uses ";" for major cases and "," for
separation of synonymous answers within a case! And
the -draw- command uses ";" between endpoints and ","
to separate the x,y coordinates. Etc.

   Except for the special case of entries in a -writec-
which may contain ";" (for which we have provided a
special delimiter), I'm afraid I don't see what this
fuss is all about. Are people really saying that they
would prefer making two key inputs and producing
a meaningless symbol for EVERY command in the language
in order to be consistent with a SPECIAL case of the
-writec-?
   P.S. end-of-line indeed definitely WILL function as
a separator in -writec- if that is what follows the
conditional expression (and of course this is not useful
in the case where any of the entries take multiple lines).

I am afraid I agree with Blomme (for once)...the "¬,"
delimitor's use surely is limited to cases where the
user might get into trouble because of the "freedom"
allowed in the rest of the tag...namely in tags where
the user has the freedom of inputting anything on the
keyset...namely, the -write- (and its derivitives) and
the -answer- (and its derivitives)...has anyone even
considered using the "¬," in such tags as:

spec    nospell¬,nomark¬,allwords
inhibit erase¬,arrow
jkey    help¬,back¬,lab
abort   common¬,records

the tag format in most commands is entirely rigid...commas
can mean only one thing...and the comma is easier to use and
looks better and prints better!
The "¬," is misnamed! Who has a better name.

Ok, I see the point about ¬, with the examples cited in
the previous response, but I (for one) was thinking more
of commands with conditional forms. I still advocate
making ¬, a universal delimiter optionally replacing the
highest level delimiter (; in -answerc-, comma in -writec-)
in all conditional commands. One advantage is that one
could then just change the command name to have, for
example, a -writec- and an -answerc- with the same texts.
The most obvious advantage is that one doesn't have to
remember which delimiter applies to which command.
[In that reagrd, -block- should accept at least semicolons,
if not ¬,, in place of commas, to be like -transfer-.] Also,
the language then acquires a symmetry that any well designed
language ought to have.

It will be changed to contain a status return; this will

Now that the student count for a course can be obtained

no longer be necessary.

Perhaps I am far, far behind the times, but I know that
AIDS has never documented this:
     In a random drill, where items are being selected from
a -setperm- list by a -randp-, one often wants to -remove-
the item from the -modperm- list IF and ONLY IF the
student answered correctly on the first try. My customary
device is this:
      answer   correct one
      do       (ntries=1),removit,x
      no
      *
      unit     removit
      remove   item

This format is certainly handier:
      answer   correct one
      remove   -(ntries=1)*item
If (ntries¬=1) then the () are zero and the whole expression
becomes zero and _nothing_ is done. For (ntries=1) the
expression ¬[-(ntries=1)*item¬] just becomes (1)*item.

        I recall recently in g-notes discussion on a
possible change of "term" to behave (possibly optionally) as
an on-page help unit, but cannot locate this discussion.
Could anyone inform me of (preferably) the status of the
proposed change or (as a second choice) the location of the
previous discussion on this?

restated, the systems people said that the suggested change
corresponded with their own thinking and that it would be
done--within a year or so.

It is a known feature of TUTOR that the common work
variables are not zeroed except at the beginning of a time-
slice. Because of this it is possible to write reasonably
conservative code that fails only under certain system load
conditions. An illustration of this is given in the first
response to this note.

I suggest that -comload- should always zero the common work
variables before executing. In my opinion, the overhead
would be more than justified because it would insure that
to-be-published lessons which function now would not fail
under some as-yet-unknown timeslicing conventions in the
future.

Interesting point, John. Hmmmmm and ugghhh.

As to NEVER zeroing the work variables (to save 150¬ms),
that is not possible for security reasons -- that would let
people read other people's common and storage.

---------- response 4
  10/29     17.55     koning       csstaff

How about zeroing it only if the next person uses nc/vc
variables? That way, ;essons that don't use common at all,
and therefore could be no security threat, are not given
this extra overhead.

        But you don't know whose common and storage you're
reading; who would object to allowing their stuff to be
read anonymously?
        At any rate, the cost of -comload- is high enough
already; those who do a lot of them would hate to see the

Put this in your TERM calc and smoke it (but not if there
are police in the vicinity):

'0;'?0 = '0;'

Moral: be careful about what kinds of garbage you have in
variables that are to be "ignored" by multiplying by 0.

by this new development in the field (of real numbers).

Also, note that typing "3?4;anything", results in 12 and

term calc, but in TUTOR lessons.

  10/28     23.15     dowling       ames

        The present error display notes "hidden characters",
and upon request displays them. To achieve this display,
several font characters are loaded. Anyone using this
feature will find his font characters modified upon return
to the editor, and will most probably have to wait through a
character reload upon the next execution of the lesson.
        Would it be possible to replace these font chars
with composite chars from the standard character set?
some suggestions are: <=>, ¬0=¬1, H=I, ??=?=, ¬I==, <=X, ¬A=¬D, ¬A=¬,, m=w=o=a==. 
        If this were implemented, I would also propose that
this expansion be made available in the editor, and that
while expanded, the line be editable, with each expanded 
code treated as a single character. This would GREATLY
simplify the greatest editing headaches, lines containing
hidden characters in which erase eats up more than desired.¬??==W¬=??O¬=?D

This problem has been constantly occuring here at ames.
It has, however, occured usually about 5-10 minutes before
a system "crash", thus, the crash has been suspected as
the main cause. Do you want us to further report this
situation? The problem of the post-crash stickeys is
seemingly along the same lines; input is suspended for
1-10 minutes usually within one minute of a system re-load.
Before the crash, input is suspended, but the last output
is re-sent continuously. Should this be further reported

be a reference lesson of command problems with stats of
fixes, like "will be working 12-1-75", "will be fixed in 2

      Example problems include loops when cpu usage is
high, lack of good control for multiple simultaneous
users of a single common, "+" and such keys working

I would like to raise here in a more general forum a
question I raised earlier at a PLATO Users' Committee
Meeting. This is the question of providing at CERL
a high-speed high quality printer capable of printing
the upper and lower case letters, the numbers, and
normal punctuation. This would allow the vast
majority of us who do not have Terminet or other
expensive gadgets to print out nice reports.

I do not have in mind the combination of low quality and
high flexibility that we get on Varian printouts; I
would tolerate low flexibility in exchange for high quality.
I would hope that either CDC has a stock upper and
lower case printer train, or a link could be established
with the IBM computer at CSO to enable use of its
upper and lower case train.


---------- response 1

I doubt if it is worth it for CERL to buy a good quality
printer with upper and lower case just for the printing
of reports.

I have used Plato for entering 3 or 4 reports that were
later printed on the local 360 in upper and lower case.
However, the mechanism for transfering the files was
poor enough, and the DECWRITER IIs that CSO has are
good enough, that I am now using a terminal in DCL for
entering reports.

There is an experimental link between Plato and the
DEC10 at CSO, you might want to check on the status
of that project.

CDC supplies chain printers similar to the IBM 1403,
called a model 580. The price is $61K; there are some
six different chains to choose from--and the option of
custom made chains. The chains cost about $3500.

For under $10K, we could get a dot matrix printer that will
do listings (with full charsets, etc) and other chores.

We have not felt that we could justify the expense of the
chain printer. We could fund development of a replacement
copier for the Varian (attachable to any terminal), a system
printer/plotter (a replacement perhaps for the line printer
and certainly for the Varian plotter), and a typewriter-at-
your-terminal using a real typewriter, with rather less than
that amount of money. If we had it.

We have in fact been investigating printers for this purpose
on and off for quite a while. We were thinking of going
another step further in terms of print quality...IBM 
Selectric or something on that order. We had an IBM rep
visit last spring with one of their word-processing
machines; it cost $10,000 and was rather more than we
needed. There are, however, other machines available,
such as the Xerox/Diablo Hi-Type I (and II) for less money.
We are hoping to purchase such a machine when funds become
available.

        Our goal is to be able to edit reports, etc. on
line, and print them out (perhaps slowly) in a form ready
for the printers.

        Hopefully some action will be taken before the end
of the year (1975). I can probably give you more info if
you want it.

I was thinking of replacing the regular printer you
use now for printouts with an upper and lower case

printouts.

If the unit you are searching for just _happens_ to be on

They are totally incompatible with the old ones, thus those

find that our comments won't line up. (This may make no

to make our coding comprehensible to others, especially
if we've ever had to debug programs that the idiot authors

Today, at least, the tabs are set 8 spaces apart, which
seems to be a nice series of tabsets. But if the tab
settings are going to change from what they were, can the
System reset old tabs, the way it changes old commands ? Or
would this REALLY mess up things ? Could tabs be reset in
old lessons on request ? And while we're at it, I would
like to vote AGAIN for tab-setting ability in the editor....

---------- response 12

I doubt if the system could reset the old tabs to the new
ones since there is no way of telling where a tab is,
given a source line. A tab simply adds spaces until it
reaches that column. Therefore, the system couldn't tell
whether the line had spaces or tabs entered.

Ok. I can see that if we are really going to have indenting
that enforcing these 8-space tabs all the way across is
necessary, and perhaps this even explains the bizarre

I originally wrote the note, all I knew was that I was

          Since the inception of -notes- a minor, but
nagging, problem has existed: what is the past tense and
adjectival form of a TUTOR command? The only convention
seems to be that of pointing out the problem.
[E.g. In the "do-ed" (sp?!) (yech!!) unit, I want to...)

1. For commands not ending is _e_, add ".ed" (. = sup,period)
   Thus, -calc.ed-; -ansu.ed- ; -copy.ed- .
2. For commands ending in _e_, add ".d" .
   Thus -define.ed- ; -use.d- .
3. For stylistic reasons, let the following exceptions
   be used.
   -do.ne-      -put- (not -put.ed-)    -jump.ed.out-
   -do.ne.to-  -set- (not -set.ed-)    -show.n-
   -go.ne.to-  -specs-(not -specs.ed-) -storen.d-

Aw, the idea isn't so bad, really. It's just that most
of us have trouble enough expressing an idea in ANY form.
let alone following a set of arbitrary conventions. The
people who would remember the conventions are those who are
sufficiently articulate that their own invented conventions
would be equally understandable.

And that's _usage_, not _grammar_.

I think it's a very creative idea. Particularly,

awkward to type. How about -do'ne- or -do¬,ne- ?

Terminet users: Please note that the 300 msec delay
following linefeed characters can be reduced to 67 msec
while performing multiple linefeeds (without sending any
printing characters). The delay following a linefeed which
is preceded by printing characters should still be at least
300 msec, however. General Electric recommends 350 msec for
the first linefeed of a group if it follows printing char-
acters, but 300 msec appears to suffice without loss of
data. As an example:

       line 1<cr><lf>[300 msec]
       line 2<cr><lf>[300 msec]
       <lf>[67 msec]
       <lf>[67 msec]
       . . .
       <lf>[67 msec] is the recommended sequence.

We are expecting to install some additional computer
equipment in late December-early January, and it is
necessary for PLATO to be down for a long enough period
for workmen to install larger motor-generator sets, get
more chilled water capacity connected up, and remove a
wall. To accomplish this, we expect PLATO to be down
from 6 am December 22nd until 8 am January 10th.

The additional equipment includes a second computer to
permit development of multiple-executor systems, and
additional memory to permit us to run a standard CDC
KRONOS (NOS) system. The arrival of the equipment is
still conditional; the site preparation is definite,
however.

We have a lesson which reads the rosters of approximately
45 courses and automatically allocates student data storage
space in datasets. The case has arisen twice already where
a students signon name was changed through course records
by the instructor of the course. The allocation program,
noting the absence of an old name and the presence of a
new one takes the only logical action -- it deletes the
old record and creates a new one, destroying all the data
collected under the old.

It is infeasible to require instructors to alter the name
in student records AND in our system. The simplest solu-
tion, for us, would be for the system to assign a unique
number to each record in a course, this number staying con-
stant over name changes. This number could form the basis
of any allocation routine, and would undoubtably have many
other uses.

        Everyone does have a unique number, and it used to
be shown next to your name on a lesson's 'last edited by'
page.. The only way to see the number now is by looking
at a course info page. If you were the last editor it
will show your number next to your course...

        I did a lot of testing, and if you are number
38 in a course right now, and all names in your course get
deleted except you, you will still be number 38 even though
you are the only person left in the course...

        The number does not change if people are added,
deleted, or names are changed. I don't know what happens
when the course gets extended or shortened. If you delete
number 3, and then create another signon later, it will
take the first available number - in this case 3.

        Now that you have a unique number, you gotta figure
out how to read it........al

---------- response 6
  11/03     20.22     k mast       p

Not so! That 'unique' number will change without notice --
it is only used as a pointer to where in the course the
record is.
        I symphathize with you, Gary. I encounter the same
problem in Personal Notes and in Student Comments, and
while it IS possible to solve for my cases, it is not easy
and would be impossible without special system commands.
        I have proposed a unique number scheme which would
assign a unique number to every individual and every course.
Two commands would then be implemented such that given a
number. it would return the name and course (or -1 if no
such person) and given name it would return number (like-
wise -1 if no such person).
        Such a system is still being discussed, and I have
no idea when if ever it will be implemented (at even a
system level), at it is very expensive disk access wise.
(continued....)

---------- response 7
  11/03     20.27     k mast       p

Releasing it in general poses another problem -- how to
we keep people from finding out names and courses merely
by writing routines to go through and try all numbers?
        The other major point against such a scheme is that
in storing numbers instead of names, if anything anywhere
(whether it be at at a systems level or users level) gets
messed up. even by so much as a few bits, then it becomes
virtually impossible to try and put it back together and
figure out what happened.
          Perhaps someone can come up with a better solution
(or modifications to this one to counter the points
against it.) If so, I would be very happy to listen.

---------- response 8
  11/03     20.41     michael       english

The proposed "give name, return number" command would solve
my problem, as I could store both name and number. Any
additions would be first checked to see if pending deletions
have the same ID number, thus signalling a name change. I
don't see how this particular command, if implemented as a
-readr- option, could hurt anything. I should think that
the disk accessing would not be exorbitant in this case.

That would not be a real solution... The record number
would be, and for this application you don't need the
(costly) ability to search for a record by record number.
All you want is that a -readr- returns the record number
as well as the name so that the 'allocation program'
can search its records for the record number rather that
for the record name. ¬??P¬=??K

<V> ::= <starting variable to pack text into>
<L> ::= <variable for length of packc'd string>
<ARG> ::= <text not containing symbol chosen from <D> >

packc    <AE><D><V><D><L><TEXT><OPT>

(The first symbol chosen from <D> is the one that is used
in every subsequent reference to <D>)

Thanks for the suggestion. I think one of the reasons
we never did put in a conditional form may have been not
only the lack of a specific suggestion for the syntax,
but also because we were probably thinking of using the
name -pack-, rather than -packc-, which would vastly
simplify the condensing.

        How about an option in the editor which would

   The option was finally put in only because it was
limited in scope--and the valid point made at the time
was that one nearly always wants to see the lines selected
for change (and after change)--so it is very unlikely
that such a feature would be provided in the foreseeable

        What I had in mind was not eliminating the present

keypress which would provide replacement of ALL occurences
of the string. Perhaps this clarification will help.

        When replacing with the "m" option I often
find things that I didn't want replaced especially
when part of a longer string matches the "old string"
       It is possible to catch these if doing them one
by one. And anything that works across block boundries
makes you lose that GREAT option... "OUT"!

Speaking from long, hard-won experience (scars displayed
upon request). it is almost always the case that the
unintended changes that occur as a byproduct of "blind"
alterations take more time to locate and correct than is
saved by not having to do a quick verification on each.
This is particularly true in TUTOR code where a relatively
unconstrained format prevents the cross-checks possible in
languages with more rigid formats (and no text!).

Well, if you are afraid of getting more scars, just don't
use a feature like the one proposed. But I would like to
have a replace-all for those (admittedly not too numerous)
cases where I know for sure that I want to replace all 60
occurrences of a particular string. I would suggest that
such a replace-all feature would be limited to one block
at a time, to make sure that OUT still works.

User suggestions are never ignored (even if no response is
given in public-as sometimes happens when the suggestion
starts a heated "discussion" among the staff). What does
happen is that they are interpreted in a larger context of
needs, demands on time, and possible side effects with
present and planned features. A detailed dialogue on
such matters for each suggestion would probably improve
public relations but would certainly decrease productivity.
What is attempted is a careful balance between extremes-
which sometimes works, and sometimes leads to hurt feelings
on both sides.

Subject: sending of messages to terminals (via "site")

Operators and site directors do, from time to time, have
to send messages to a large number of terminals (for issuing
directives to users, managing classroom use, etc). An un-
fortunate side effect of this is that lines 30 and 31 of
the screen displays are overwritten by these messages.
This creates a particular problem for students who may
have to back out and go thru many pages of lesson in order
to restore the display on which they were working at the
time.

There are three possible solutions to this problem:

---------- response 1
  11/05     12.17     fay       o

(solutions--continued)

1) Move the message down to lines 31 and 32.

2) Reduce the length of the messages to 1 line and move 
   that line to 32.

3) Make it a general policy (for authors of lessons) not
to put critical text on the lower two or three lines
of the screen.

As a frequent user of lesson "site", I personally think
that choices 1 and 2 are untenable: we frequently need
that message length. What do the other users think?

---------- response 2
  11/05     12.19     loitz       acoustic

Another suggestion is do not resend the message.
It is very fustrating to spend the time replotting
the page only for the same message to overwrite it
again.

---------- response 3

i favor moving the message to lines 31 and 32... the
probability that it would coincide with a system
message is very low...
*
two further suggestions: authors shouldn't write
on the bottom two (or three) lines if at all possible...
and where it must be done, that should be as unessential
data as can be selected....
*
most instructional lessons shouldn't require extensive
backing out and reworking to replot the most essential
parts of displays... if for no other reason than line
errors , very common at remote sites, which frequently
scramble displays.

Incidentally --

We have found that, in some cases, a particular student's
screen can be "repaired" by resending the message in mode
erase (-via- the good old shift-"?","2") feature. Perhaps
a "fix" can be made by allowing the message to be plotted
in mode erase... kludgy, but...

        Resending the message several time is vital to 
people who are aborting output through repeated full-
screen erases. Once, one of the people "responsible" for
sending messages at MFL sent the message only once, I
didn't get it, and they backed me out of a rather 
bad place in one of my test creation routines. To say
the least, I was angry. This also happened to another
author while he was in the middle of the curriculum editor,
also doing something complex, and he lost a display he
was creating.

It would be _extremely_ convenient if TUTOR had a command that
would submit a file to the print queue. Specifically, we
have program that formats performance data on our students
into datasets for printing. How I wish that at the end
of this program I could run through a loop of

print (dsetname),'optionalsecuritycode'

with an appropriate zreturn value saying I already have an
outstanding request for this file or that the file has been
successfully submitted or whatever.

It is very unlikely that direct access to background
processing (like running print jobs) can be granted for
quite some time. It is possible that with sufficient
restrictions to prevent people from clogging the works,
a command could be implemented which would do essentially
what print requests currently do (i.e., make an entry
in a file which is later used by an operator at a
convenient time to submit and run the actual printing
jobs). Sorry, I have no idea when or even if such
a thing might be considered or done.

I think that the chance of things getting clogged up with
a -print- command are not much greater than the chance
of them getting clogged up by some joker who feels like
entering 1 zillion print requests by hand. Particularly
when the suggestion of making an entry only when an entry
for the specified file doesn't already exist is adopted.

---------- response 4
  11/05     20.30     frankel       p

Of course, there would be additional problems, since
(currently, at least) the file to be printed is not read
from disk until the print job actually runs; thus, you
wouldn't be able to go ahead and wipe out the dataset (or
whatever) immediately. So then we'd need to tell you when
the file had actually been read, so you could clean it
out, but you might not want to clean it out, since the
printer ribbon might be messed up and you'll need to print
it again; of course, then we'd need a command to signal the 
operator to go check the printer, and a way to signal
you back that everything was ok, or whatever. I'm sure
there's more after that. Anyway, like Rick says, I think
it'll be a while...

Dave's comments are not really to the point. They apply
equally to the manual insertion of print requests into
the request queue. Given a command in TUTOR that would make 
that insertion, one could still check status by hand.

The point is that some programs that format data into
datasets for printing need to run once a day. With a print
request command, their operation could be automated to a
greater degree than it is now.

If there were commands like:

printset myfile (I know it has too many characters)

which would establish a link with the print log to see
what the status of "myfile" was, i.e., not in the queue,
in the queue, printing etc., and another command:

print myfile

which would put a request to print "myfile" in the log only
if the status of "myfile" was "not in the queue", then
I can't see any problems that don't already exist in the
current printing structure.

---------- response 9

Right. In order for the -print- command to have maximum
usefulness a -printset- (or maybe a read-write tag to
-print-) would be necessary. I was _not_ asking for the
ability to call the print routine. I don't think the
present structure of the print queue would have to be
changed either, if the user executing the command was
stored as the requester (which for my purposes at least
and I suspect anyone elses would be acceptable).

---------- response 13
  11/06     21.03     alan       reading

It certainly would. However, it is unlikely that an
instructor would want a print of a regular TUTOR file
(unless they have a new puppy or canary).

In our particular case, a teacher requests hard copy
of certain information about her class. This involves
running a program to format the information in a dataset
to be printed. So we queue the request and run the program
at night. When this program is finished someone must order
the prints for the datasets. And the program cannot be
run again until the prints have been recieved. Hence the
original request.

See how a -print- command (with reasonable restrictions of
course) could improve our system? Incidently the above
program is run automatically every night so we could forget
the program even exists except to deliver the prints that
show up in the operator's office.

---------- response 14
  11/07     10.40     fay       o

I see nothing incongruous in allowing instructors to
directly request a print of dataset and datafile type
lessons. Obviously, these types of prints ARE frequently
relevant to the duties and skills of the instructors.
(I am not, however, saying that instructors should not be
allowed to print regular files, although I personally
don't see the need.)

On the other hand, it is reported that extensive changes
are in the works regarding student data collection
currently. Maybe this work could be directed to meet some
of the aforementioned needs?

---------- note 62 vocabs?
  11/05     22.16     iezek       ames

It is possible (please, pretty please?) that the vocabs
block and its editor could be improved.
I have 2 main gripes about this:
1) The vocabs block should be placed as the first block
        of your lesson so that it is before any commands
        that use it. Instead of this, it may be preferable
        to have a command to "use" the vocabs block at
        a particular point in your lesson.
2) There is no way to take vocabs commands written in
        the regular editor and place them in a vocabs
        block. Either the insert save option should
        be put in the vocabs editor, or some way to
        convert directly should be put in (similar to the
        "convert from char commands" in the charsets.
I would appreciate it if I could get a _meaningful_ systems
responce on this.
I would also like to hear the suggestions of others.

  A MEANINGFUL response to 2) would have to be
that it is untrue. There is no problem in converting
back and forth between source and vocab blocks.
(Naturally your block cannot have calc and write commands
mixed in along with your vocabulary info). Just
press SHIFT-DATA  when "inside" the source block you
wish to switch to a vocab block. If you already have
a vocab block and have additional info you would like
to append, then first change the vocab block to source,
add the new vocab info or put the info in a following
block with the same name, then convert the block(s)
back to vocab.
   Obviously there are various other conveniences that
would be nice to have, and they may indeed be added
some day.

The original reason was that charsets and commons sometimes
use more than one block. When you add and delete blocks,
the physical blocks are not reshuffled, but are just
re-numbered in the part of the block directory which we
do not see. In order to get two or more consecutive blocks
for charset or common, it was easiest to reshuffle and
stick the new blocks at the end.

I don't know anything about how Rick has changed this.

It sure will be nice to be able to put -charset-s where
I want them!

no reasonable argument that -aids- is the best reference

That line is not intended to stifle the copying of single

list of keycodes. That would be defeating the purposes
of AIDS. It is rather intended for the

2) to prevent wholesale copying of many pages of a manual

There is no obvious reason for not allowing varian

  11/06     09.19     maggs       law

    The previous note "John Law" brings us once more to
the question of copyright. To repeat what I have said
often before:

     There are two types of copyright, "common law" and
"federal." If a work is published, common law copyright
is lost. If the work contains the proper copyright
notice (copyright (_=c)==^^_ 1975 by Joe Smith), at the time
it is published, federal copyright is obtained. (before
enforcement, federal registration is necessary for federal
copyright, and once there is a publication, the library
of congress can demand 2 free copies).

   AIDS does not have a copyright notice. Therefore
publication of AIDS would forfeit common law copyright,
without obtaining federal copyright. Freely allowing
Varian copies _might_ be considered to be publication and
so would forfeit the AIDS copyright.

        Sorry to differ with you, Maggs, but I just checked
and -aids- does indeed have a copyright notice on the main
title page (which most of us authors probably never see, the
Q option being so handy). However, I have a feeling that
the material in -aids- has not been formally registered with
the government, so your comments probably do obtain.

I think we are both right. Jim tells me they have changed
their front page -- I think that between the time I looked
at it and the time you looked at it the notice was added.

By the way, it is not registration but publication that
makes a copyright enforceable under federal law.

However, AIDS may not yet be published under the
criteria I mentioned in the notes, and even though
the copyrigth notice is on the unpublished copy,
the proprietors may not want it published at this
time for any one of a variety of reasons. Thus
they may not yet have federal protection.

thanks, peter. as always your advice in this area is most
welcome.

For more than a year, the title display of AIDS has
contained a statement which said don't copy AIDS without
the authors' permission. unfortunately, not all users
adhered to that request --- some users have been seen
with more than 50 varians from AIDS --- manuals have been
published with displays from AIDS --- all without the
authors' permission.

AIDS is intended to be an extensive, on-line, up-to-date
documentation of TUTOR. as a co-author of a book on TUTOR,
i know how difficult it is to keep printed material on
TUTOR from becoming obsolete.

NOTE: many users have requested permission to copy parts
       of AIDS for various reasons. their request were
       never denied.

Some of the comments to the previous note show once again
that some (many?) users simply do not understand that the
author of something has a right to his/her creation, and
to benefit from it. Just because a few keypresses give
instant access to thousands of hours of material, there
seems to be a feeling that everything belongs to everybody.
If the people who complain would try to write their own
AIDS, they would soon find out why the authors want to exer-
cise their rights.

I copyrighted some calcomp plots which I then silk-screened
and sold. A copyright is in affect just as soon as you
put the copyright on the final product and present it for
public consumption. The kicker is that in my case it did
me no good because it turns out that a poster worth anything
is pirated almost as soon as it hits the market place. It
turns out almost impossible to protect. The big poster
companies depend on speed of marketing in order to beat
the pirates.

You have to send two copies to the government, but the
copyright is in affect before the government gets their
copies. The fact is you can send the copies to the
government years later! All you have to do is prove that
it was presented for public disterbution on that date. Not

   When a -time- command is initiated at an arrow, the
time command remains in effect even though a "no" judgement
was reached.
   Tests seem to show that if the return to the arrow is
done by a -judge- ignore- the -time- is canceled.
   Could this be changed to work the same as a "no"
judgement?

---------- response 1
  11/06     15.19     white       p

Existing -time- commands are aborted when you press
NEXT at the arrow (as it states in AIDS). Generally
if you find something that occurs in your lesson that 
does not agree with AIDS, you should see a consultant
before writing a note.

I would guess you are probably executing a -time- command
after the -no- judgement. Perhaps you are using a
-judge no- when you really want a -judge noquit-?
I am just guessing, a consultant might be able to 
help you more than I.

If you want to -judge ignore-, you can insert a new

you to the arrow.

  Here are the important parts of the code in question:

  The -judge exit-s used to be -j. ignore-s. When a 
-j. ignore- was encountered before the "timeup" key was
pressed, the -time- was canceled. -j. exit- keeps the
-time- in effect, however. Seems inconsistent on first
glance.

  To Judy:

Yes, I had thought of that, but in this case, that kind of
code could keep a child who is randomly touching the screen
from ever hearing the help message. Of course I could
have kept track of the time with a variable and done a
-time <remaining time>- kind of thing, but that seems
a little inelegant.

I believe the current restriction of an unexecutable

allocation. What do you do with a student who suddenly
requests more ecs than is currently available at his

determine whether the storage change took place.

It seems like that comes under the "Ah, wouldn't it be

What I (and quite a few others) would like to see is some
type of _c__o__n__d__i__t__i__o__n__a__l_ storage command -- where you would not
actually change the amount of storage a student (or what-
ever) uses, but Whether He Gets It At All. This is handy
in the case where, say, an author needs the storage for one
section of a lesson, but students in the SAME lesson don't
need the extra space.

We do plan to do this. It hasn't been implemented yet

Further details about the planned down time:

The amount of work to be done is now seem to be larger than
previously estimated; we will therefore move the down time
up from 6 am Dec. 22nd to 12 noon on Dec. 20th (Saturday).
We seriously intend to be back up running by 8 am on
January 10th; I expect, to be realistic, that at least the
first few days will be a bit rocky. The largest problems
should be out by Monday, the 12th of January--but PLATO
does put loads on the computer that cannot be equalled by
maintenance tests. We will have some problems the first
week we are up.

The revised down dates are thus:
  12 noon Saturday December 20th, 1975 to 8 am Saturday
January 10th, 1976.

We will try to prepare a reasonable set of tapes that can
be played (when possible) to keep you informed of the
current state of the work.

---The problem.. those full screen erases did not occur.
was in Gen. Notes, Shift-Backed out to main index and
pressed -c- to delete a p-note. I had the over 80: jazz
and pressed NEXT--my first note overwrote. Since I knew
that there had been trouble I continued as long as it would
happen. There was no line error light (a miracle),and I
got -13- overlaps. I pressed HELP, which made it 14.
The thirteenth overlap was back to the notes index (from
there I pressed help). I pressed the s-3 error button,
no help tho. then I pressed the s-2 clear button which
blanked everything. NEXT got me the author mode page
and no more overlaps.
The reason I was so lengthy was because I wrote all
the steps down as I did them, and it might help you.

be done until the clear button is pressed. If the clear

---------- note 136 ERASE
  11/07     11.38     rader       s

Here is a summary of what we now know about the Problem of
the Lost Full Screen Erases:

1) First, it must be noted that the full screen ("bulk")
erases are the hardest task the panel has to perform. This
means that as we make a list of errors caused by various
malfunctions, it occurs on more of the lists.

2) The panels (and the bulk erase problem) can be heat
sensitive -- a hot room can cause the loss of all bulk
erases (see 3).

3) A familiar problem is that the terminal (panel) goes
into a state where all of the bulk erases are missed. In
these cases pressing the "clear" button cures the problem.
--Continued in responses--

---------- response 1
  11/07     11.46     rader       s

(Continued)
4) Double parity errors cannot be detected--if you have
high error rates it is possible to lose a bulk erase (among
other things). You will see many line errors at such a
time.

5) A timing problem does indeed exist in the panel
interface to the terminal, which can, very infrequently,
cause a bulk erase to be missed. This has only been found
recently in the circuit diagrams; it may depend to some
extent on when the terminal and panel were made. There is
no fix available. This could easily explain many of the
problems reported in notes. This problem has been observed
by the engineers, however, for a very long time, and is
not something that should have cropped up recently. On the
other hand, changing panels might have made the problem
noticeable at a particular terminal, etc, etc.

It is difficult to pin down all the related factors for low
probability failures--but this is undoubtedly the source
of many of the failures that have been noted.

full screen erase. This is not a major effort, But we are
keeping our eyes open.

I have been suffering from missed erases for over a year

TA-DA! The winner of the PLATO Down Tapes Display Contest
are on display in lesson "tapedisp" (student mode).

Our thanks to the many contestants for helping to make the
contest a success.

And a special personal thanks to whoever sent me the
unmarked plain brown envelope full of negotiable thingies.
Congratulations to the winners. The winning entries will
be incorporated into the "down tapes" shortly (like, for
all that down time Sunday).

After seeing those, it won't be so bad when Plato is down.
But the visuals are limited in number, and once you have
seen them for enough times even they will pale. It is the
variety of the assortment over the entire down period that
is the most difficult element. How many different kinds of
visuals can be stored for running when PLATO is down?

Not that I'm complaining, but someone persists in putting
"Shadow by dasher/uni" on the index page. "dasher/uni" does
_not_ exist, much as I wish it did.

The current supply of looped tape cartridges have a max.
loop length of 100 sec (ie, the length of time before it
starts to repeat itself). Given that it is a somewhat time
consuming job to make a couple dozen different tapes (one
for each special type of down time) the variety of displays
will (unfortunately) continue to be somewhat limited.

PS I thought I wrote d sherwood/uni (knowing the objections
to letting you call yourself "dasher"). Sorry.

i have not personally written a router lesson based
upon the system router but i understand that when
ecs is in short supply, the system router can
advise the student that a new lesson is unobtainable--
and then a list of lessons already in ecs can be presented-
right?
*
my question and concern is-- suppose a lesson listed in
an index set up for students has internal jumpouts-- that
is it permits jumpouts to other lessons which are not
in the index. is it possible to "tell" the router
that those lessons are potentially available in the
event of ecs shortage? or is the opportunity of
sharing these lessons lost because there is no way
the students can find out that "non-indexed" lessons
are available?

All the system router does is put a special mark (?, I
think) beside lessons on the index choice page which happen
to be in use. So if the lesson doesn't appear on that
index page, there is no place for the system router to
put that special mark.

  There is no problem with rights. The codes that the
file had when the backup was made will still be intact
when the copy is retrieved. We can't actually do a
passwords check anyway because one reason for a backup
copy is that the file may have been destroyed accidentaly
by the account director or a system error.

        Len marked your request 'retrieving' when he went
to put the proper pack on a disk drive. Unfortunately, the
disk drive would not operate properly, and he was unable
to copy the file from the backup pack. Your file should be
copied later today. We are thinking of adding  a feature
to display the current condition of the backup request

This may be ignored if the new notes system is just around
the corner (it may be ignored anyway) but the title search
when you type in an alpha string at the what note arrow
would be more useful if it searched backwards. This is
especially annoying in new sys features where there are
no responses. Type in "concept" and you too will become

When requesting a print the arrow will give an ok judgement

is full) which could lead the simple to believe they got

"authors" is edited as fast as we can. The list is not the
list of authors on the system It is the list of authors
whose names are on the DATA pages of lessons and therefore
some people who are listed in authors are no longer here
even though their lessons remain on the system. We are
a bit behind in cataloging, however. We should be current
again in about three weeks.

        How about numbering each page with its own unique
code that would be displayed somewhere, perhaps the LR
corner. This would allow people directing others to
info in "aids" to say, "Look at page X".
        Along with this, there would have to be a unit

     This book is a review of the state of the art of

rightly much of the book is devoted to offline systems,
and to the use of computers to teach computer programming.
However about a third of the book, maybe 100 pages is

PLATO is based on teacher oriented preparation of CBLM. The

END OF QUOTATIONS

I realize that this is a long note, but I  think it is
important for us to see ourselves in the perspective that
at least some others are seeing us, and in which the readers
of this apparently authoritative book will be seeing us
for the next few years, namely as rating less than 1 page
in a 100-page survey--a pretty poor show, since as the book
points out we got a lot of $$ from Uncle Sam.

We here at Maxwell AFB are using both the PLATO and the
TICCIT systems to evaluate their possible use in the
Air Force as an aid to correspondence education. Judging
from what I have seen, from working with both systems, the
PLATO system is by far a superior CAI system. However
the TICCIT system costs a great amount less than PLATO.
So what it comes down to is this: can an educational
organization meet its objectives in teaching a student
with a traditional hard--copy approach or should it go
to a CAI system, then, can it meet its objectives with a
system that costs less (like TICCIT) or perhaps go to
a much more expensive, and more sophisticated system?

It would be interesting to know what TICCIT costs per
student-contact hour and how these costs break down.
Could the writer of the last note or someone give us
this information? The book I mentioned had a lot to
say about TICCIT, but almost nothing to say about the
costs of any system.

note "cai review" in lesson "healthauth" discusses
a similar problem in the health sciences... the sad
fact is that the computing and educational communities
have in general only the slimmest understanding of what
is possible in CAI and in many cases not a heck of a lot
of interest.
*
you may also be interested to know while the cost of
purchasing a TICCIT system is much less than that of
a PLATO system, in small increments (say 32 terminals),
TICCIT costs exactly as much as PLATO _per_ _terminal_--
about $10,000 (for all capital costs pro rated per
terminal, 32 t. for TICCIT and 1000 t. for PLATO).

does anyone know if there are estimates of operating
expenses yet?

I was at a conference recently in which, at one point,
the discussion was centered on the question of what
language CAI lessons should be written in: FORTRAN,
BASIC, or APL. TUTOR was not even considered as a
possibility! I did, of course, suggest that TUTOR
be considered since there is a lot of lesson material
available on the PLATO system. However, the general
feeling seemed to be that since so few people have
access to PLATO and since, in their view, PLATO is too
expensive, TUTOR really does not exist, Note that the
cost is based on the total dollars spent on PLATO not
on an analysis of cost per terminal hour and the value
of other languages is measured by the number of people who
have access to them, not the productivity per user.

      No one has yet addressed the question of different
philosophies between TICCIT and PLATO. They are vastly
different systems, but both seem to have targeted about
the same cost, less that $.50 per terminal hour. Until
ETS finishes its evaluations I doubt that we will be able
to get any definitive cost data on TICCIT.

      The best source of information for public dissemination
on both TICCIT and PLATO has been coming from the office
of Eric McWilliams at NSF. A good description of TICCIT,
put out by MITRE, was available from him.

      Comparisons and differences between the two systems
would take many pages. I regret that the HumRRO people
didn't devote more space to PLATO. Probably ETS will
publish a definitive comparison (I hope).

based upon their presentation at a seminar at the ADCIS
meetings in portland, maine, the ETS has a long way to
go if they are going to give an accurate picture of
PLATO to "the cutside world". just possibly, they'll
get it all together before the final report... otherwise,
the burden of putting the hard data together will fall
mainly with al avner and his group.
*
*
in my opinion, one of the most productive thing PLATO
proponents can do now is to attend lots of meetings,
give papers, and be informed-- particularly on costs.
as dr. smith points out, this is probably the area
of the greatest misconceptions about PLATO-- possibly
due in part to the old estimates of 35 cents an hour!

        How does everyone feel about changing the function
of the STOP key so it can no longer abort output?
          Long ago this was an essential part of the system,
as there no way a person could abort a long output for say,
another page, without first pressing the STOP key. This has
since been changed so that full screen erases abort output,
and the STOP key is not really needed. In fact, the STOP 
key can be a hazard to students who have lost displays
because they pressed it by accident.
          If we changed the function of the STOP key, we
could do one of many things:
(1) Make the STOP key so it no longer aborts output.
(2) Make the STOP key abort output only for authors, (who
    could conceivably have some use for it)
(3) Make the STOP key abort optional for both authors and
    students -- a new command perhaps, that once executed

---------- response 1

would make the stop key abort output for that lesson (or
if executed in a router, would abort output for that
session). For authors, it could be made optional with the
same way the talk, user, and ext, options are made optional
now.
        I personally favor the first option, as it would
be the simplest to implement and to understand (things are
confusing enough as it is!). Is the STOP key abort really
used that much still that its complete removal will place a

I vote for Warner's idea. -inhibit- would allow as much
control over this matter as any author may want to specify.
I would use such an -inhibit- tag just before loading a
charset which is essential to my lesson, once having seen a
student try to study a lesson without the charset loaded.
An -inhibit- stopkey would be much simpler than branching
upon the value of "error" or "zreturn" after a -charset-.
I assume that the -stop- command would be unaffected by any
of these alternatives.

Kim, students rapidly learn to use the stop key, just
as authors do. When they see a long title page, for
example, or a long display that they have seen before
(in reviewing a lesson), they do learn to press STOP
to abort output.

How serious is the problem of accidentally aborted output?
Any lesson that doesn't allow a student a reasonable way
to replot a page (even if it means going through a
section of the lesson again) is poorly written.

   For right now you should leave the -stop- key as is,
but take into consideration the idea of the -inhibit-
with 'stopkey' as a tag. Then give us more time to
think about the present uses of -stop- and see if it
should be automaticly available as it is now. Try us
again in about a month or six from now.

As an aside--it would seem somewhat instructive that
students have been observed to use STOP to abort long
displays and title pages. Doesn't this suggest something
about the usefulness of overly involved graphics and
displays that must be encountered frequently? Is there
perhaps a lesson to be learned from this other than the
usefulnes of retaining the ability to abort such things
voluntarily?

I'm in favor of number 3 in the form of a new command

   as for the display ideas, the first few times, it really
catches interest! Then after that, providing the person
knows what to do with the stop key, they can get through
the lesson faster. But the nice displays do catch the
initial interest, which I is beneficial. I always use
the -stop- key myself (even through my Simple displays),
and would hate to see it go.

Are there any other remote sites that are having the same
problem we are

Our students use the stop key to turn off the error light
and this often causes loss of display.

This would be a plausible reason to make the stop key
not abort output. (As along as the stop key would still
function to cancell the error light)

          It would seem that students that use the stop key
to turn off the error light are poorly instructed as to the
use of PLATO.
          In some instances, a good, eye-catching page with
pretty graphics is very useful in breaking the ice between
apprehensive students and the computer.
          It might be useful to be able to inhibit the
pressing of STOP in student lessons, but those instructors
who use the "burn in" theory of education (2 minute displays
with no way out) would revel in this chance to further bog
the learning process.

First off, those of us at microwave sites or rooms with
carpeting must say that accidental destruction of a display
by a line error is just as frequent as accidental abortion
via STOP. In either case, a replot key on each page, or
some way to get back via an index, would be a lot more
beneficial than taking away the STOP key from those of us
(authors and students) who like to be able to cut off
displays we've already seen but have to go through again
because the author of the blasted lesson didn't put in
a replot key.

those who claim that well written lessons will never
need the STOP key to abort output are not considering that
many well-written lessons are used MANY times by the SAME
person-- hence it may be very useful to use STOP to
abort a display which may have been useful the first
three times through the lesson but not the fourth...
*
it seems poor logic to eliminate a useful feature
because it MIGHT be occasionally misused. it would
seem better design to instruct the students on the
correct use of the feature --  and to provide replot
facilities for the cases when the instructions aren't
effective!

The point about stopping output was made in reference to
a STUDENT user. Now if an instructional lesson has
to be gone through so many times that the student has
the intermediate pages memorized then most likely
something is very worng. ALSO pressing the next key in
a page turner which has full screen erases DOES abort output
which is why this whole thing was brought up in the

     One vote for option ¬$3... I am writing a lesson
which uses a lot of graphics (a lesson on polar
coordinates) but I don't think that the displays
are poor just because someone who has been through
it before might want to use the STOP key.
     Usually, I just use the NEXT key to cycle through
while editing since a full screen erase (due to unit
command) can be executed before the whole equation
gets plotted.

Todd, we have students who go through a single lesson up to
six or seven times because they want the review. In such a
case, they have no need to see the instructions before hand,
but those instructions MUST be kept there, since the student
is completely confused the first time he or she goes through
the lesson. STOP is a lot more effective than NEXT in most
cases.

ALSO a point of interest!

Full screen erases do not always abort output!
They will once the process of aborting output as been
established by pressing of the stop key.
(since the -stop1- at signon does the same thing, its
almost not noticed that this is necessary!) Try a terminal
that has an auto signon for a student who doesn't need to
press -stop1- to signon. This feature becomes very obvious.

Another thing: full screen erases do not abort outpur if
there are characters being loaded into the terminal, ext's,
audio's, play's, and slide are sent to the terminal. Once
all output has caught up with the terminal, the feature then
starts working again.

Well, seeing that I more or less just started on the system,
I am still prone to take as an example the words and
suggestions of those who have been on longer. While
learning about good methods to write lessons I came across
a little segment that had a little man try to erase a page
of text. He appeared to do this randomly. He just could
not erase the whole page. The point of the segment was
to dramatically tell an author to give a student a break.
I have needed this break many times. There have been
times when I have put values into graphical plottings
that just take too long, maybe 3 dots plotted in a minute
or so!!! ( my stupidity of the theory but still needed.)

The operator "=" means algebraic equality in comparisons:

-0 = 0 returns TRUE
2.0 =  int(2.0) returns TRUE

Sometimes, however, you want to test bitwise equivalence.
Suggestion: make the "¬)" symbol do this function. Thus:

-0 ¬) 0 would return FALSE
2.0 ) int(2.0) would also return FALSE

since the bit patterns are different.

This would also permit comparison of bit patterns
set up in n- and v-variables.

While on the subject, one question which I have
about H. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought that
the command took one word, and then each ten chars of the
tag took more words of storage. In displaying, if I
understand what you mean when you use the _'s to show space
left, you count two chars of the tag as counting in the
command word. And, on one of my lines, it is adding another
10 chars of 000 to the tag, i.e. the tag stops right on
one of the marks, and then I see 10 _'s after the tag.

Maybe I'm wrong in guessing what you mean when you are
using _, so would someone please enlighten me?

There is no "command word" as such -- the "command" takes
up the first 8 characters of the first word of every
TUTOR line. Each line is terminated by at least two
null (o00) characters; the next line begins in the word
following. In your example, since you had 10 total char-
acters in the line, those characters used 1 word, and the
two o00's were contained in the next word. Since there
was nothing else there, the system assumed o00's filled the
rest of the word.

Each command takes 8 characters, but each end-of-line is
indicated by an octal 00. Thus a command without tag
requires 10 characters or one word. Each 10 char. of tag
(or fraction thereof) requires 1 additional word.
If the tag ends on a word boundary, the o00 end-of-line is
still needed.

The _ indicates a space (produced with the space bar), not
space left in the word. Any space left at the end of a line
is filled with o00 codes.

It seems that we both responded at the same time (or at
least were both composing responses simultaneously).

I just realized that in the H option, the underscore _ is
used to indicate the o00 end-of-line/fill character, and the
space is indicated by the space. The two expansions should
be changed to agree. I vote for the one in the error
display. The F ¬+ A are easily confused with the upper case
characters the user may have in his un-expanded line. (Of
course, these would be expanded, too, but to the causal user
it could be confusing.

Now if we could just have an editing capability on the
H-expanded lines, with the copy and erase keys taking only
one octal code at a time. This would really simplify some
of the most difficult editing tasks.

Even without this, the improvement is appreciated. ¬??W¬=??C¬=??D

   Sorry, this has actually never worked and may not

the erasing routine does not retain any margin info so
that that starting carriage return follows an -at- which

Most authors can't be on PLATO very long without beginning
to have their own philosophy (whether explicit of implicit)
about it, it's possibilities, it's modus operandi, etc.
Why not set up a lesson to survey authors' attitudes as to
just what PLATO is and can be? My own personal view of it
is more like a library than a classroom, but that descript
falls short. Another aspect is that authors are really
students, too...the lessons like AIDS obviously take that
fact into account. There are many other areas of
consideration which Notes only touch on. Certainly there
have been discussions on individual topics before (i.e. game
lessons), but I have not found a discussion of PLATO which
is comprehensive. Perhaps even an on-line survey would fall
short; maybe a lesson should be set up for notes on the
philosophical and directional aspects of PLATO.

An extensive series of discussions on such areas were
conducted several years ago. They are really too complex
too summarize but I will try to relate some of the
central points below:

(1) Eventually, PLATO must become a "common carrier" type
service, like the telephone network or one of the new
specialized carriers, in order to prohibit, by both law
and custom, censorship of any form.

(2) The proper uses of the system will be defined by
technical considerations (TIPS, memory needs etc) and 
not judgments by some group concerning what is educational.
It is essentially impossible to reliably distinguish
between educational and non-educational uses.

(3) The continued success of the system depends heavily
on the "psychic income" level of the people using the
system. Facilities which provide this psychic salary
are too be encouraged.

---------- response 4
  11/11     19.56     carter       comm

Well, how much progress has been made along these three
lines:

Concerning the first point, progress toward a common carrier
tradition, Plato is certainly above average in resisting
external pressure, but still has a long way to go in
achieving the ideal of a completely free medium. Could
Dan Ellsberg have "published" the Pentagon Papers on
PLATO rather than the Times. Nope.

The record on the second point, proper use, has been
outstanding. To a large extent, anyone with a serious
purpose at the U of Ill. has access to the system.

The third area is the one that concerns me the most at
present. "In the old days" (meaning 72, 73) one could
walk down any hall in cerl and run into people like
Gary Hyatt and Stu Umpleby who often had their office
in cerl but received their pay elsewhere. They spent
large quanities of their time contributing to Plato

sometimes in the face of academic and/or monetary adversity.
I for one was highly impressed at a system which could
inspire such loyality. As the system grew, however, users
gradually migrated back to their departments and the
building filled up with essential personnel: repairman,
administrators etc. The cost has been a reduction in
psychic income, and hence motivation, for those that thrive
on the old organization. Perhaps the most encouraging
reminant of the spirit I am talking about is the junior
system programmers who continue to make large contributions,
apparently due to psychic income since their monetary
income is substandard.

        My concerns about royalties, expressed elsewhere,
largely stem from the fact that these methods are being
employed, prematurely perhaps, to make up for the gradual
reduction in psychic income over the last few years. I
would encourage

Once upon a time I was discussing the philosophy of PLATO's
own special brand of CAI with one of the system programmers.
I inquired why there was no apparent effort to maintain
some sort of objective (that is, external) standards for
materials on PLATO. My own feeling was that many, many
of the "lessons" on the system were occupying needless
disk space and were sometimes less than even automated
page turners. The response (not necessarily the official
system view) was that PLATO service was provided to as
great an extent as possible as merely the medium thru
which (m)any group(s) could attempt virtually any applica-
tion of CAI, no matter how rudimentary. The concept of
PLATO as a medium rather than a specific set of programs/
lessons was news to me, but seems to make a lot of sense.

Stu Umpleby (whom I met briefly a long time ago) had a
concept of a "University

  I believe a solid negative correlation could be drawn
bettween the "psychic" wealth of PLATO and its _overt_
operant survival potential.

  If this wording is too specialized the try this: As PLATO
draws closer to becoming a corperation with economic
interests, the average person's involment with PLATO
will become more overtly greedy.

  To secure resources (information, disk, ecs, cpu), one
will find it necessary to compete on levels other than
"psychic" or research.

  This competition will involve the manipulation of
persons and systems in control of these resources
in the most economical way possible regardless of
the "ethical" consequences. This is generally called
"corruption", however I won't be that harsh... I'll just
call it stupid so as to demonstrate my lack of skill in 
the "correct" paths of manipulation.

It has been suggested by Dr. Hody (in a response to gen.

out and demo the system more.

If a lesson existed on Plato that would provide the
potential demonstrator with various info he might need, this
would not only make preparation easier and better (and thus
encourage more demos), but could also serve as a
demonstration in itself.

The lesson could have an index for info on: Plato's history,
Plato's hardward, costs, future plans, statistics on ¬$ of
instructional hours accumulated, topics of instruction, plus
jumpouts to network,sample, others...

Also it would be more up-to-date.

To continue wasting disk space:

If the person who wrote the original note
had pressed HELP, he would have found
it suggested that he leave a note in general notes if
he "had found a bug in a TUTOR feature" or wished to
comment on a "new feature." His comment clearly seemed
to fall in one of these categories, yet he ends
up getting a lot of abuse for following instructions.

Futhermore, the pso - systems people get abuse for
not giving instructions when they have clearly asked
that notes on these categories go in General Notes.

Then maybe when some minor catastrophe happens (such
as a system ECS parity error, disk error, etc...) the person
should be told to put it in HELP NOTES since it is probably
a problem which does not warrant permanent storage.

In the same light, I'm sure that during that period of
time (since I was (attempting) to sign on during that
same time) that a person did NOT receive a page which
stated to put the problem in general notes.
Come to think of it, most of the statements of 
"Put it in NOTES" that I have seen during times of error. 
it does not strictly say GENERAL NOTES but just NOTES.
If I was new on the system, and went into notes with a 
problem of this sort, when I saw the catagory HELP NOTES
I would think that this would be the appropriate place to 
put it, since I was having a problem and needed HELP.

  I'd like to see a provision whereby an execution of 
a lesson can tell when its timeslice is about to end. 
  This would be useful when (1) you have someting that 
needs to be done "now and then," on a timescale _comparable_
to autobreak times, and don't want to waste resources
timing for it; (2) you're doing your own 'timesharing' or 
interrupt processing; (3) you're using unprotected common
for scratch space but must save part of it between time-
slices.
      The most convenient way to allow this would probably
be a "break unit," established either at condense or (prefer
-ably) at runtime via a -breaku- command. Thus, if a breaku
is in effect, it will be the last thing done in each time-
slice (except when a finish unit supercedes it.)

If you think you are going to start playing with unreserved
storage and get away with it, you're in trouble. Soon, in 
fact, you will no longer be able to rely on straight line 
calcs being performed in one timeslice.
      To have a command to -do- a unit just before a 
timeslice ends is possible, but would not serve your 
purpose -- there is no way of guaranteeing that you will 
get to -do- the entire unit before the timeslice ends.
        As for periodic interrupts, I would look into
possible modifications of the -timel- command.

It is very bad programming practice to rely on aything
having to do with timeslices. Changes to the timesharing
alogorithms at some point in the future could easilly dis-
able a program that runs well on today's assumptions.

I believe that it should be made impossible to write on
the work vars unless they are proected by linkage with
common or storage. To allow their continued use violates
what should be a paramount system rule, 'protect the user
from the system'.

It appears that what was said in a prior note is correct:

1) Lesson A declares storage, then a jump is made to
    lesson B, which does NOT declare storage. If
    lesson B then causes a jump back to lesson A, the
    storage is dropped.
2) This is verified by *lstorag*, and an attempted
    -transfr- to storage will cause an execution error
    of "no com/sto" only after the storage is dropped
    in this way.

3) Will this method continue to exist? Is the dropping of    
    storage in this manner reflected in reduced ECS
    charges?

---------- response 1

The following retains the current storage (and length)
into the new lesson:

inhibit dropstor
jumpout lesson

If the length of storage is zero in the original lesson,
the user will not have any storage in the new lesson,
even if storage is declared. Storage is not dropped
automatically, you need the above code to do it.

Yes, this is as permanent as such limits as
blocksize=322, and maximum storage=1000.

---------- note 355 dset die
  11/13     23.22     parrello       uimatha

Currently, if a student has executed a -dataset- command for
a given dataset, one cannot edit said dataset: the editor
gives the message that "individual blocks of this dataset
have been reserved", regardless of the reservedness or lack
thereor of the dataset's blocks.
Conversely, if one is editting a dataset, a poor schnook
student who tries to execute a -dataset- command gets
=zreturn= set to 2, which "aids" cryptically defines as
denoting that the "file is in use elsewhere".
This is not documented ANYWHERE.
As a result of this lack of documentation, the School of
Basic Medical Sciences has lost untold amounts of data.
Needless to say, someone who gets =zreturn= set to 2 has
no idea of what the hell is going on unless he or she has
ALSO lost data for the same reason.

If this cannot be changed, could it at least be
written up somewhere?

---------- response 1
  11/13     23.46     blomme       s

  That "lack of documentation" has caused untold
loss of data is very very hard to believe; easier to
believe is that many people persist in attempting to
do dataset (and other operations) without ever bothering
to check for an "ok" return.
 One exact way to produce the value of 2 ("in use
elsewhere") is indeed if someone is editing the dataset
(i.e., changing the info in the first block) and this
may indeed be worth mentioning in aids. Note carefully:
the value 2 is not equal to -1 and hence CANNOT mean
that the dataset has been successfully attached (regardless
of the "obscurity" of the error write-up).

---------- response 2
  11/14     00.18     dave fuller       uimc

   I would appreciate it if the AIDS writeups would
give the contingencies that can cause these things to
happen. "file in use elsewhere" isn't very good, and the
fact that "blocks are reserved elsewhere" is useless to
someone who is trying to learn to use datasets, and spends
hours trying to find who is executing reserve commands
in his file.
     As a result of these cyptic writeups. I can
readily see where someone could assume something that
was not true, and then misprogram things, with the sub-
sequent loss of data.
        Ample warning should be made of the fact that ANY
return that is not negative ("true") means that the op-
eration attempted was NOT done as expected.

---------- response 3
  11/14     01.21     parrello     uimatha

I am well aware that when the value of =zreturn= is positive
it means that the dataset has not been attached.

I do, though it is not obvious, possess a small amount of
intelligence.

This is why I send all students to unit "panic" when
the dataset fails to attach properly.

I am open to suggestions as to what I am supposed to do
with the student once he reaches unit "panic" before the
time limit on a finish unit runs out.

Unfortunately, a solution involving datafiles cannot be
used because the various courses involved are using
datafiles for their own separate purposes.

---------- response 4
  11/14     01.53     blomme       s

Nobody bothered asking, but the check made is quite
necessary and unlikely to be changed.
 Points:
(1) The meaning of the error return as given in aids
 is basically all that was provided by the system
 staff; more precisely the notation in the system code
 reads "file attached elsewhere"...so no fault should
go to the people writing aids.
(2) The system dataset editor should operate on a record
   basis and not on blocks and should do reserve/release
   operations and not a file attach. Presumably this
   will be done in the not too distant future and these
   problems will be more or less eliminated.
The file "attach" done by the editor is similar to that
done for other files to prevent more than 1 person changing
information at the same time. _DO_ put a change code on
your dataset and DON'_'==_ _ edit it if users may require
access to it.

---------- response 5
  11/14     04.07     galcher       uimatha

One question then.

     What if record size is made to be changable
from the file directory page? In this case (since
you have not "attached" the file (assuming the case
where datasets have been changed so that if you
edit a dataset from the author mode page it does
not give zreturn=2) but you are allowed to change
the record length, then a program written generally
enough to allow variable record sizes (assuming a
thoughtful programmer) will read a record (size N)
and perform manipulations. During this time you change
the record size (to size M). Then the program (not having
to do another -dataset- would assume the record size N
and would try to write this quantity to disk. This
needless to say this would have somewhat nasty
consequences... I prefer the current arrangement.

  11/14     11.02     alan       reading

Incidently the aids writeup parenthetically (is that a
word?) adds that a zreturn of 2 means the file is being
editted. This discussion came up a day or two after
reserve and release were announced for datasets.

The reasonable solution we came up with was to use a
different change code for datasets than the one we use
for other files so as to not accidently lose data.

Try preceding the unit name with four blanks. Since

directors to clear security codes for forgetful authors.
One other point, though:

Is it planned to enable account directors to inspect a file 
without having to zap its inspect code? The ability to 
look at the entire data page rather than simply the power 
to change its security codes seems necessary.

     Why not just give the account directors the 
     ability to look at JUST the data page, if that 
     is what they are worried about, instead of the 
     lesson code?

They can't look at the codes, mike. All they can do 
is blank them out. 

The facility is necessary to clear codes from lessons
where authors have left and failed to tell anyone the 
code to the lesson.

An account director often needs access to a lesson, but the
author should be notified that the account director was 
there. This procedure leaves a trace even if all the 
account director wanted to do is inspect.

Actually this is an old policy. I often get requests from 
the kind of people we now call account directors to tell
them the codeword to some lesson. I never do! Rather, if 
I believe they have the right to enter the lesson, I delete
the change code. That way I go on record as having tampered 
with the lesson. Now the account director need not wait for 
us at CERL, but he must leave a trace.

The reason I am making such a fuss about the changes I
want for the full lesson search is because the changes 
would provide the ability to do a number of constructive
general tasks at cheap cost. 
There is a lot information inherent in the ordering of 
the lines of code.
For example:

1) display unit branching structure:
   Search objects: 'unit' 'next' 'back' 'help' 'data'

2) display which units 'anything' is in:
   Search objects; 'unit' 'anything'

3) check which mode various writes are in:
   Search objects: 'mode' 'write'?
4) examine judging structure:
   Search objects: 'arrow' 'answer' 'wrong' 'ok' 'no'?

I have done some testing and it seems that it replaces
octal zeroes with 055. The form of the command is:

clean n1,3 $$any number or variable

This command will have the effect of changing all octal 
zeroes in variables n1, n2, and n3 to 055. The second
number plus the variable number may not exceed 150 as
this will casue a bounds error. I don't know what this 
command will be used for or even if it has been 
developed completely.

Actually, it replaces not only 00's, but also 070's (shifts)
SUPs and SUBs so that they do not screw up doing a -showa-

The command is NOT released, and can change at any time 
WITHOUT prior warning. In other words, I wouldn't use it

-lineset- is an excellent addition to the language!

of course, it will generate some inevitable requests. let me 
start the list:

an -lchar- command for those who don't want to use up a 
whole block.

a keypress to convert -char- blocks to -lchar- blocks. that 
strikes me as feasible since a char will always fit in an 
lchar. i know the results might need some fixing up, but 
an auto conversion would still save time. 

an option to interrupt output of an lchar to the terminal at 
the end of each line segment for a short period of time to 
enhance its use in pseudo-animations.

I agree that -lineset- is an excellent command. A few 
comments on the editor though.
It currently looks like the charset editor but differs in 
some minor ways that may be confusing, for example:
1) Charset uses NEXT to switch from key to number mode, 
   not NEXT1.
2) Charset uses BACK1 to exit without change (from the main
   choice page) rather than HELP1.
Things like this may cause mess-ups when going back and 
forth between the two editors. If possible, it would be 
nice if both editors use the same conventios. ¬??=====P¬=??K

Originally the lineset editor did have NEXT to toggle, but 
this is very accident prone: the charset editor will 
be changed sometime in the near future....

     On lchars: linesets are much closer to commons than 
they are to charsets: nothing is loaded into the terminal 
memory: consider: is such a thing available for micros,
for example?

      Someday there will however be the ability to go 
from rdraws to linesets back to rdraws.

On the ability to go from chars to linesets:

   This is not and never will be feasible: John
Eisenberg can perhaps best explain this, as he has done
a conversion along this line: consider a period '.'. it 
contains 4 dots: when i convert to a line drawing, do i 
draw a box, or an x, or two horizontal parellel lines, 
or two vertical lines, or 4 dots, or what?

        It was thought that a lot of people would want to 
make linesets out of charsets, so there is an option in the 
editor to see your charset in the lineset editor.

        Also someday, there will be the ability to go from
linesets to charsets, but not the other way around...

That one's really kind of far out, but suppose I want to 
illustrate how to form a letter. The way one does this now 
is to put the line parameters for the letter in a common
and execute them one at a time with delays in between. Now 
if we could do that with the lineset itself (with a third 
arg to the -lineset-, for example) we could eliminate those 
commons.

As to the other things: No, there is no analog to the 
-char- command for micros. But when one has to create a 
whole micro to change one key, one often wishes there were.
The same may become true for lchars.

Yes, I know David has tried to convert chars to lines. The 
results are never more than 70: satisfactory, but that's
still a savings of 70: in re-design time. Being able to see
your charset micht be an adequate substitute, though.

I always like people that make suggestions before using 
an option. Yes, lchar and mchar commands would be nice.
Probably never will come in because of high overhead.

Executing one line at a time for a lineset?
That sounds like displaying one dot at a time for a regular 
character. Doing this SHOULD require special programming.
A command should make programming easier, not be the 
complete program. Perhaps the function of the -edit-
command should be changed as previously recommended?

Some suggestions/annoyances about the lineset editor:?
1) When R is used , the cursor reverts to the previous p
or s point. This is very annoying; the cursor should be
left alone, since it may be just a dot off, and it may have 
taken a lot a trouble to get it where it is; all that 
trouble now has to be repeated!?
2) On the try-your-chars page, pressing BACK takes you 
back an arrow at a time. It takes 3 BACK presses to get 
off that page, or one DATA and one BACK. There should be 
a single keypress to leave that page; it there is one, I
did not find it.?

---------- response 1

3) I'd like to simply convert a certain charset to a 
lineset. Most of the chars in question are multiple 
slot "characters". This doesn't seem to work in lineset:
the individual "chars" come out with a few blank dots 
between them. I suppose I could use a single large lineset
"character", but then the stuff would not display properly
in the editor, in size 0. Is there any cure for this 
dilemma??
4) Perhaps I don't understand the EDIT/EDIT1 options 
on the char design pages. I wanted to remmove some lines 
I had plotted, and replace them with others shifted a dot 
or so, but I could only get R to work on one, and it 
reappeared when I replotted with DATA. How is this editing 
option supposed to work??
In case there's any doubt, I've read every help page!

It would be very nice, in the large char editing mode, 
to be able to use the "k" option; i.e., to display some

location, presumably), or elsewhere, to be simulated.?
Is there any way to get from the edit-a-quandrant to the 
full large grid edit page?

1) if one removes a lot of lines, one would want the cursor 
to follow. Its a matter of taste, i guess. it doesnt matter 
to me either way 
2) to exit the tryout page, press SHIFT BACK ( i forgot 
   to put it on the help pages 
3) There doesnt seem any way to fix the joining problem:
       Rick Blomme or John Eisenberg will be able to 
explain this i think/
4) The EDIT cursor will move around your lines on each 
press of the EDIT key: you may then draw another line from
that point. or remove the line before the edit cursor: I 
dont quite know how else to explain it,,
5) display a char on large grid editor will be put in

Perhaps 'r' to delete a line and leave the cursor, and 'R'
to delete the line and have the cursor follow? Or do you

I think Sellers has a reasonable suggestion. Certainly,
after struggling (sp?) a couple of times (already!) to 
get a line exactly the length I wanted it, I feel very
strongly that having the cursor retreat when I press R
is NOT a good idea! Please note that no other system 
editor (e.g., ID and SS in the lesson editor) does this.

The best way I've found to fix the connectivity problem
is to edit one of the characters that adjoin in the 
large grid mode, extending the lines one dot towards
the character to be connected. You only have to edit

The best way to solve the connecting problem in just the

A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, to coin a 
phrase. In other words, for your own sanity, don't
zero your datafiles, datasets, etc immediately after re-
questing a print thereof. You see, the print program
takes a while to get around to each individual request in 
the print queue and does not even care what the contents 
of your file looked like at the moment you requested the 
printout. The print program looks at the file only just 
before it gets to the job. In other words, you may think
you are printing a datafile when in fact you are printing
one page (which is blank) if you re-initialized before you 
had the print in hand.

And, no, we are not going to set up a "working stack" or

A temporary solution for the joining problem is to set
the ending position for all your linechars to 7,0
( i believe this is option 3 on the second index page ).
this means that the beginning of the next character will 
plot 1 dot before it usually does.. This does not, however 
work for all sizes... but I am afraid i dont understand how 
drawing those lines in the editor is going to help matters

The editor I show is 9#17. This gives one dot of overlap

Your solution fixes horizontal connectivity but not
vertical connectivity. This is fixed by the nature of 
write to 16 dots.

Through playing with the new lineset I have discovered 
(with darlene's help) that when naming a lineset block
you must use only one word names. Charsets are unaffected
by multiple word names but linesets will not load if 
you assign multiple names to the block i.e. " line set," or

I suggest you look at the PLATO resources in "aids" to 
see what a variety of information exists on-line about 
lessons. There are "topics", "sample", "authors", "catalog",
"catalog2".....etc.

Also there is a revision of "catalog" in the making which
will combine "catalog, and "authors" to be seen in "student 
mode" and there will be (eventually) a new "catalog of 
finished (publishable) lessons" which will have many feat-
ures even to accessing the lessons themselves.

Meanwhile I will be happy to help you find lessons in 
subject areas if you can not find what you are looking for 
on-line. Just write me a "p-note".

When writing a note to someone, it 1st asks for Name

for example, if will tell you "No such course" and then

  About 8 months ago I suggested a feature of TUTOR that
would take care of several badly needed functions plus
supliment existing ones quite easily as effectively. I was
told to bring it up again in a few months so here goes:
  How about a command that would allow switching the path
taken by internal codes generated by -write-s -writec-s
-show-s etc... from output processing to a set of variables:

zero    n6,2
outvar  on,n6,1
writec  flag, negative,zero,positive
write   ?    $$cr
show    flag
outvar  off *zreturn or whatever giving ¬$ of codes outvared

In this case if flag is, -1 then n6=016050701241126057146
and n7= 034000000000000000000 with zreturn=11.
The implications of a command like this would be widespread
and consistant with existing string processing in TUTOR.?Comments?

         I myself would like to see some user-accessible
variable giving the size of the contents of the TUTOR
output buffer, so that I can decide how long screen displays
might be broken or controlled during the lesson. This would
be especially handy for applications involving precise

The only "problem" Silas points out is that he wants a
completely different function from the one I described.
  In fact it doesn't work with -write-s and -show-s in
the way he suggested. What you would like, Silas, would be
the key codes stored (which are the ones sent to the
terminal) rather than 6-bit internal codes used in
"internal" or software manipulations.

  This option might even used to do the inverse
of the internal-to-key-code conversion via -plot-.

Point well taken, koning, except -jcount- is used in
answer continjency.

Could a system's person versed in the feasibility of this
type of function give a response to the point at hand

I personally like the idea. The write/writec/showx mach-
inery is, in its current structure, an excellent way to
conditionally generate strings -- provided you want to those
strings to show up on the screen! A method by which those
strings can be stored, altered, and re-displayed would be
a powerful addition to TUTOr.

You may be using the term "site" wrong:

Any location that contains a terminal is a physical
"site" and in the cases that the terminal is not
expected to remain at that location for an extended
length of time, that site is temporary.

Now that terminal use has stablized somewhat, network
is pretty good.

"Once a stand-alone minicomputer host, such as PDP-11, can
be dedicated to interconnecting of a multi_ported pLATO
Terminal Interface Unit to the ARPANET, the problems of
ICP's, multiple terminal operation, buffer sizes, and flow
control can be eliminaated. Further, since the machine
would be used for one purpose, programming, program changes,
and experimentation, could be readily carried on.
With a large number of test hours using PLATO CAI over the
Network we discovered that our single terminal was very
suitable for use in any lesson we chose. We did, however,
avoid lessons that required the student to react in a
certain amount of time and which effectively measured his
response time. These lessons make up a small portion of
the entire repertoire and the user who requires these must
go directly to PLATO. *cont*

"This will continue to be the case unless, through exper-

found to provide this "anticipatory" requirement.
With response time eliminated as a factor in the bulk of
lessons, or in other useable features such as graphics and
conferencing, there is no doubt that a finite set of users
or conferees could operate very well on PLATO through the
Network. They would also be able to make use of both
PLATO graphics and TENEX graphics (when it exists) in order
to confer.
Twelve production APTs have been delivered to USC-ISI. It
is hoped that their use for Network conferencing and a need
to bring the PLATO system onto the Net as an additional
resource, will lead to the improvements suggested in this
 document."

I think Paul is being diplomatic in not evaluating the
conclusions drawn. Packet-switching might be a good
way to transfer lesson material off-line between plato
systems. It is almost certainly a disaster when applied
on-line, between the plato user and the central computer,
for reasons that are obvious (2#50k/1200))=¬$of plato
terminals that would saturate ARPA lines,in the general
case. The only thing extra communications processors
and memory can do for you is slow down response time.
I hope potential buyers of this terminal are given a
demo under actual use (arpa) conditions, not plato
conditions(which are far superior).

This note is an example of a trend in NOTES of what
appears to me to be excessive politeness. If computer
based communication systems are ever going to be taken
seriously, people are going to have to feel free to say
what they think. Since there appears to be a natural
human instinct shy away from controversy, due perhaps
to mistaken notions about the purpose of advocacy, maybe
PLATO should consider means of encouraging free discussion.
One possibility would be to inhibit name and course
designations(on notes) from all readers except those
with a need to know(s,p,pso,e,a, etc). I haven't decided
myself whether this is better or worse, but I do think
it would encourage greater frankness and decrease the
occasional abusive comments (since name-calling without
names is impossible).

These anonyomous or "delphi" notes could have the following
advantages:

1) Would teach people to deal with ideas rather than
   personalities. Appeals to reason would increase,
   appeals to authority would decrease.

2) Would promote free discussion in cases where one's
   job supervisor or superior also used plato--if one
   was inhibited for reasons of job security.

3) Would promote free discussion in cases where one
   was psychologically inhibited due to a lack of
   confidence to present a position in the proper
   style. In short, hopefully substantive comments
   would increase, stylistic ones decrease.

I'm afraid I have to disagree, George. Enough groups have
tried using anonymous notesfiles -- with sometimes disas-
trous results -- that it seems fairly well established that
anonymity does not encourage responsible discourse, at
least not in the PLATO environment. And the idea of keeping
names, but only showing them to systems personnel, would
tend to increase the resentment some people already have
towards system reserved powers. Perhaps something should
be done to increase such openness -- but I'm still burning
from the last time I expressed myself in NOTES in somewhat
less than temperate language.

        It seems to me that this suggestion is a two-edged
sword at best. For, while anonymity might encourage some to
speak more freely, it would simply encourage others to speak
more irresponsibly. And since, as michael/english pointed
out, name/course information would have to be eschewed alto-
gether, there would not be the inhibitions against abusive-
ness that there is now. In general, I think that the cur-
rent policy works quite well. And if, at times, people are
hesitant to say what they feel, that is more than counter-
balanced by the ease "signed" notes makes possible in con-
tacting other users.

          But the fact still remains that if one wanted
          to speak out strongly on an issue that was
          highly controversial without actually using
          abusive language, he/she would still be looked
          down on/reprimanded by his superiors or by
          the people by which he is employed. One such
          reasoning for the employers to get upset is that
          they might not get the lesson spaces that they
          desire, or the certain system features that they
          desire if they had a person in their course that
          wrote controversial notes. They say that the

I am interested in trying to rationalize an ancient holdover
in the "embedded" commands--the embedded "mode" command.

As many authors have learned, the embedded "mode" command
only appears to be an embedded -mode- command: it really
talks directly to the formatter (via the well-known, but
not officially released keypresses) to change the mode of
the current character string. Since it is not a -mode-
command, it does not change the system's internal status
as to what "mode" you are writing in--your subsequent -show-
does not follow the mode you just thought you chose!

I propose that we simply install a true embedded -mode- --
and the question of course, is, to what extent are there
lessons that depend on the current definition?

I find the temporary effects of the embedded mode quite
useful in places. I also think it would be a great help
to have a embedded size that had but a temporary effect.

I like the idea of having a "temporary" embedded mode,
for reasons similar to Marshall's example. For me, an
ideal fix would be to have it last throughout the -write-,
regardless of other embeds (except other ¬0m¬1), although I
realize this would be difficult to implement, and, for
consistency, should apply to embedded -size- at well, which
would be more likely to disturb existing programs.

Having two types of embedded mode, as well as the real
-mode-, seems like unnecessary clutter and would be
difficult to explain.

---------- response 14

Ok, time to show my ignorance.
  Is the embedded mode faster (even tho embeds are slower
[!?!?]) because they don't "really" put the terminal
in mode xx? (Ie, does the shift ? x actually send the
appropriate parcel to the terminal?) If the shift ? x
DOES send the same parcel, I don't see how it can be
faster, and if it doesn't, how does it change the
terminal's mode? Is this coherent?

---------- response 15
  11/19     13.12     frye       mfl

No. The terminal is actually put in whatever mode you
specify (of course!), but is placed BACK into whatever mode
you were in before. It's not a question of what parcels
are sent to the terminal.....

Personally, I prefer the current form of the embedded mode.
I use the -mode- command for cases when the terminal is
"semi-permanently" in a particular mode, and the embedded
version for VERY temporary mode changes. It seems to me
that that's the way it should be.

It seems that ¬0m,e¬1 should designate a true mode change, but
that users have also found the current form quite useful.

How about running a conversion to change all existing
occurrences of ¬0m,e¬1 to something like ¬0tm,e¬1 (for temporary
mode) and then allowing the old form to designate that
true embedded mode change?

The embedded ¬0tm,e¬1 could be used for cursor routines or
whatever, and the ¬0tm,e¬1 / ¬0m,e¬1 distinction seems more
clear than between ¬0m,e¬1 / ¬0m,E¬1.

The ¬0m, ¬1 is basically changed to the keys that people

The present embedded mode definitions apparently have
their uses, and the proposed new definitions clearly
would also. I think that there would not really be
serious difficulties explaining the differences between
the two...for the reason that the new definitions would
be easy to explain. and it would not be necessary to
explain the old ones to new authors. The difficulties
with new authors exist NOW, because the present embedded
mode definitions are strangely different from the other
embedded command definitions. An implementation like
that proposed by david/reading sounds good to me.

I can see why you want to discourage people from making
copies of pages of Aids (as discussed in notes before),
but I think it is too much to simply make it impossible
for a poor programmer who does not know all the keycodes
by hart and does not have his trusty Tutor manual handy,
to be unable to make a copy of the Aids page on that
subject, simply to avoid having to look at it (editor
Qkeycodes) 10 times because of not having a photographic
memory. I would suggest that the message be considered a
warning message and that those who copy Aids pages in
spite of it will be able to do so, without trouble if it
is for the reason stated, or with if it is for the purpose
of making unlawful copies.

convenient (and no more than that) to have a machine
handy that can in seconds provide me with a printed
copy of a useful page like the keycodes. The alternative
for a user is to (a) go to pso if anyone is in,

(e.g. that to protect copyright in some possible future
legal battle, they must show that a strong effort was made
to restrict distribution), the rest of us should probably
take a page from their book (with due credit of course)
and put course/name/station restrictions on all our lessons
to keep them from being copied at will by potential

The point of many recent discussions of copyright has been
that the exact consequences of being relaxed about

deal well with modern technology and the new copyright laws
haven't been written. In such an atmosphere a very conser-

I worked for a timesharing firm (Com Hsare inc) that had
what is probably the most conservitive possible
interpretation of the copyright laws, and also probably
the most defensable should any question ever arise about
rights to some material.

Any translation of material from one medium to another
was considered to be an instance of publication, even if
one of the media was transient, such as orange dots or
green glow on a crt, as well as less transient things
such as teletype (or terminet) printout.

To support this view, they had a royalty system that could
be attached to any user program that would make an automatic
per use charge. Any user with copyrighted material who
wanted to make it pubic could ask that this royalty
mechanism be attached to his program, and specify the use
charge to be made (Title or introduction pages were
encouraged to contain notice of this).

Authors who find charset keytops from lesson cslibrary
useful may be interested in looking into lesson keytops,
where an incomplete version of lineset keytops resides
TEMPORARILY. When complete, this lineset will have both
a straight copy of the charset, and also a single-keypress-
per-keytop version. It will then be copied into lesson
cslibrary, and lesson keytops will be discarded.?
In making this conversion, I had to make consecutive
characters connect properly. For the benefit of other
lineset designers, let me point out that the problem of
connectivity between linechars was solved by putting all
the key outline into a single linechar, and all of any
individual letter into a single linechar; the result is
full connection in all sizes, although some linechars are
outside the "standard" 8#16 grid for a single character.

Well. I know about the X-search within a block, and also
about the new expanded internal X-search. I meant that it
would be useful to be able to go from the lesson-wide X-
search, off the block listing page, to the first instance
of the string that is found by the search, rather than
exiting from the X-search mechanism to the block listing
page. As it works now, you find the block listing of the
string,then go to the block and do an X-search (or a c-
search,as the case may be) all over again. I'm not com-
plaining about the feature: far from it. Just thinking of
making it handier.

It would save a lot of grief if the "convert common to
source" feature would automatically remove the comman from
ecs (or give an error if it is in use). This would avoid
problems like converting a common to source, editing the
source, then using the common again without an error
message, because the common is still in ecs although there
is no longer a common block in the lesson it came from.

By the way, what happens at present when the system tries
to write the common in ecs back to disk? Does it discover
that the common block in the lesson is no longer a common
block and abort the update, or does it wipe out my source,
or what?

---------- response 1
  11/20     07.56     david       hebrew

The update is not done (since the common is all dressed
up with no place to go); your source remains intact (small
consolation since you wanted the updated results anyway).
There is apparently some type of error that can be detected
on the system level; if you try and return a common
that no longer exists when you hit _R_ on the author mode
page. it says "Error in returning common"

I'm not sure about the newest terminals, but the older

terminals with a pair of wires. Two pairs of terminals
could be connected that way, then one pair could monitor the

But for an explanation: every time the X search must
go past block boundaries, it does a disk access.

The system can only support a limited number of disk
accesses for each user in a given period of time.

If it is found that the X search is consuming a large
number of disk accesses, it will be taken away.

On the other hand, doing the same lesson with datasets
might consume the same number of disk accesses anyway.

either the freidman or the berger response as especially
critical. Consider your experience in this case along
side that of the recent introduction of linesets, which
was met with a torrent of suggestions/complaints/quibbles/
demands. It _is_ a little hard to get used to, but that is
the way the system progresses. If maggs' comment does
apply, you should be glad to find it out now rather than
later, when you have an even larger investment in your
method. // I do agree with you that kind words are rarer

Some misunderstanding seems apparent.

Physicians and students will call us on the telephone and
ask, what do you have on "medical ethics" or "hangnails"
This envolves a long, page by page search through a hard-
cover catalog. Using Plato to search for us thgough the
catalog I've written, takes only a minute or so and we
can often put the person on hold while we search. I mean
no disrespect with regard to people who critize, its their
right, I mean only that they are quick to do so without
finding out the problem. Judy/pso solution isn't practical.
I took the X-search lesson to be used for what I'm using it
for and saw no warnings as to disc access, CPU etc....
What I don't know seems to hurt me in this case.

The suggestion by Judy (pso) would reduce the search time
from tens of seconds to milliseconds and put virtually no
load on the system. It would also allow any number of users
to consult the database at once and could easily be used
by the students or instructors themselves. Of course it
would require some more work on your part to enter the data.
Since you have already entered the data once, it is under-
standable if you are reluctant to change now....but it
is something to think about for the future.

Getting back to your original note, we do appreciate the
words of thanks from users. It is possible to tell that
a new feature is liked from the extent to which is used, but

Most text editing systems that I have had much contact
with, from the PLATO editor to TECO on the PDP-10, or QED,
the grandaddy of many interactive editors, have evolved
to the point where they make reasonable data base managers.
They may even be the best for some light applications, but
are rarely efficient for large scale systems.????
On the other hand. the concept scheme, with the data base
embodied in the lesson text, though it is fast, is not
very flexible. If this is to become a prodoction system,
with frequent updates and retrieval requests, some dataset
based system would proobably be best, using the
vocab/concept mechanism for the indexing. This would
require only 1 disc access per info. request.????
Such a scheme might even make a valuable system resource,
many thigs such as a current index of all public lessons
could be managed automaticly, thus freeing time now spent
by pso.

the "standard" table that is in lesson microtable is
NOT the one used by the system when it provides a
standard table by default. I have no idea just how
many entries are different, but I note that the system
micro table was last edited a few days ago and the

when/if there are resources available to spend on key-

the problem is to have an -arrow- that has all the usual

when the response to be accepted is of arbitrary type (when,

Interesting--I was just giving this some thought not

It would seem that PLATO has a tremendous advantage for
easy distribution of lessons. My question is: Is anyone
doing a study to see how much cross-utilization there is
between sites? Are we duplicating efforts, or are authors
evaluating, revising, and improving what has already

this problem partially. We can first make a cursory search
with this, before bothering anybody else. Also, by looking
at whatever does exist, we might find out who knows exactly
what has been done. Again, unfortunately, this is only a
partial solution.

And it's not peculiar to computer-based materials. The
card catalog of any large library is persuasive evidence
that man is a creature who loves loves loves redundancy or
that each individual man thinks he can do the job better
than it's ever been done before.

It is surprising, by the way, how good a refernce resource
lesson -topics- is.

the major problems with cai are the cost and difficult
of producing quality materials and then presenting
them to students at reasonable cost on a realistic
schedule. the acceptance of cai by faculty and
administrations as a viable learning medium is also
a severe problem and finally, it is difficult to
get people to share materials, particularly between
systems.

This is the problem that the idea of "published" lessons
is trying to solve. However, until legal arrangements are
complete, CERL has a moral obligation to protect the
interests of those who have prepared lesson materials (CERL
because any other organization would have a great deal of
difficulty in providing a complete catalog of PLATO
material). Another consideration is that much of the
material is now in a final (or earlier) draft stage rather
than in a finished and polished state. With any medium,
draft materials are used only with direct permission of
the author--hence the listings like "topics" which allow
access to names of who is doing what rather than access to
the lessons themselves.

This problem of accessability to the neophyte has been one
that I have really been interested in. I attempted to
write an aviation index and have it listed in a lesson
to be named "aviation" which would be the logical naive
guess for someone who is trying to see if there are any
such lessons on the system. It met with positive response
on the part of the authors concerned but with negative
response on the part of CERL people. I was told that I
could give up my own lesson space for it but none would
be supplied. Understand the lack of space creates
problems and I am undoubtably overemphasizing the need for
such an index but being very concerned about the vast
potential for plato and the naive subject I wish space could
be made available for such general topic indexes. Authors
not wanting thier lessons listed would not have to have them
listed.

The "negative response" is simply a function of the
limited resources we have. Many individuals do in fact
maintain special subject-area indexes and communications
files as services to independent author groups in a
specific area. Since such a file is a private venture
(in the sense that it is not maintained by CERL) it must
come out of the resources of an individual. Generally
an individual with a strong committment in a subject area
has sufficient file space (from extended efforts in the
production of lessons in that area) that such is feasible.

But an individual with a strong committment in a subject

Why can't there be a system defined key group for all

        Systems -- in view of the present plight of keys
being lost in great quantities, including "timing" keys,
as in disk I/O and jumpouts, are you interested in doc-
umentation about circumstaces that reliably produce
failures, or do you have a handle on the problem already?

---------- response 1

All documentation of reliable failures is appreciated.
Particularly appreciated is documentation which includes
examples which have been boiled down to the minimum code
necessary to cause the failure (this is far easier to
interpret and far more likely to get fast response than
an indication that "unit nrnd of lesson sqrawd loses keys".
Given the option of trying to dig the essential elements
out of existing code as opposed to trying to guess what
is going wrong, it is frequently more efficient for the
systems staff to do the latter. As you can well imagine,
the latter may be rather inefficient in absolute terms. It
is not a matter of not caring or not being interested but
rather a matter of trying to do the most good with minimal
resources).

lessons. After all, if variable jumpouts are used in the
manner that the cs lessons use them (to return to the

        The hardware research group has developed a speech
recognition system for use on PLATO. It is designed to
recognize individual words inputed through a headset
microphone. A demonstration of this system will be given on
Tuesday, December 2 at 3:00 pm in Room 351 of Cerl.

        The voice input hardware is attached to the terminal
ext jacks. Vocabularies are stored in common with each entry
utilizing 8 words. Vocabulary entries are formed by training
the system with actual utterences. A (non system) 'hear'
command has been developed that allows easy integration of
spoken responces into lesson material. This command allows
the specification of small subsets of a larger vocabulary
that are eligible for recognition in particular situations.

---------- response 1
  11/21     00.51     oppy       research

        Unfortunately, due to the complexity of speech
recognition and the restrictions of PLATO's I/O structure
the recognition system has a number of serious limitations.

        The first is that the recognition software uses
a good deal of processing time. Tests indicate an average
of 11.5 ms of processing per eligible vocabulary entry.
This may lead to frequent 'automatic interupts' (autobreak-
ing) and will limit the number of simultaneous users of the
speech input system. The high CPU usage and the time needed
to transmit the keys generated results in a significant
delay between the uttering and the recognition of an
utterence.

cont'd

--------- response 2
  11/21     00.53     oppy       research

        An additional drawback is that the reliabilty of
proper recognition is somewhat low (although this is very
dependent on the size and nature of the vocabulary). For
a vocabulary consisting of the 10 digits,we obtained between
70: and 93: correct responce, depending on the speaker.
The use of one set of vocabulary enteries by many speakers
reduced the recognition reliability considerably indicating
the desireability of training a vocabulary for each user).

        Dispite these limitations, it is hoped that this
system can play a role in special purpose applications.
(such as allowing handicapped students to use PLATO or
using voice input when users need their hands for a related
task).

        More information on the internal workings of the

be found in PLATO's annual report for ARPA (Jan - Dec 1794).

        Synthesized speech may provide the upper bound for
recognition reliability but I doubt this bound approaches
100: since the input system can only extract a limited
amount of information from a speech signal. The speech
information lost would prevent perfect recognition even
if utterences were spoken in an ideal manner.

As a side question, could the speech input system be

I am thinking of a "voice fingerprinted" password instead
of a "secretely typed" one. No, I'm not paranoid, but I
think it might curtail "incorrect" uses of signons.
I also see the 8 words/entry problem, and I'm sure there
are many others. I'm just asking if they're prohibitive.

        Since the voice input transmits a very limited
amount of information (about 250 bits to represent an
utterence that may contain 12000 bits of information),only

a rough approximation of a word is received. Too rough
an approxiation to allow for voice identification.

There are various things afoot, I think, now that touch

Let me take the opportunity to point out that in such
situations one should really use "judge wrong", not
"judge no". "judge wrong" sets the judgement to
"anticipated incorrect answer", whereas "judge no" merely
sets the judgement to "unanticipated incorrect answer".
The two judgements affect -area- summaries (and the

A comment line starting with c must have _only_ c in the
command field. Otherwise there would be bloody marrow
to pay when the condensor hit commands like _c_alc, or _c_har,
or _c_ourse. However, no command begins with *. So anything
that begins with * is a comment, both command and tag.

Actually, you may put other characters in the command field
following 'c', but the second character of the line must be
a blank space.

A suggestion for the lineset editor:

I see it could be implemented in one of two ways...
*** The problem...I don't see how one can translate _and_
rotate a part (0 to 100:) of a linechar
while creating it.

         (1) In the editor, be able to specify which part
             of the lchar that you want at another angle
             from a specific base or focal point. Also,
             be able to translate this segment to a differ-
             ent point at a specific angle of rotation.

*** This is the suggestion that I prefer since I see more
    versatility in its use.******
        (2) The creation in the editor of a very temporary
             buffer character space. This is to be used
             only as a "drawing board" of segments of lchars.
              a) Can edit as in the usual way, and the

               the results may be transmitted (at a
               specified angle) to one or more lchars.
              b)Also, either a whole lchar (or a part?)
                of one already created may be loaded into
                this temporary space and transformed in some
                way... then distributed to any or all lchars.
             c) *examples-- a good example is the -*-, or
                something to be created in its family. You
                want to design something that is a rotated
                copy of one unit (though more complicated
                then the -*-.)
                *another one might be, say you want to make
                a crown with the same "stone" on all five
                points of it, well first make the stone
                and store it in lchar-1. make the base of

                to go in and then place it at the correct
                positions on the crown's points.
                *Also, it would help if the lchars are very
                similar but only minor differences. One
             could construct the basic feature and then
             the variances separately and have control
             over where it is placed on the new lchar,
              and in more then one place and/or rotation.

Any cooments....maybe this can already be done, but I
haven't found it. Also, I think that most of these things
are close to existing (though for other functions.) already
in the editor( you can copy lchars from one place to another
etc.)!

good idea, I have had this problem myself

  -in the large grid display, I needed to move the
   origin because the character had to be able to
   overplot another character already finished.

however, I am not convinced that rotation is as easy
as is indicated. I suspect that unless rotation is
limited to the making of reflections and rotations
about the two axes, the results would be crummy.

  For applications in which a precise prediction of output
time is needed it can be demonstrated that the high
level manipulations of output in TUTOR are quite
indeterminant in time and content and therefore ineffective.

  A solution to this problem would be to make the -codeout-
command offer functions of the terminal beyond the
uncover code and special function chars.

ie:
codeout ldm,full $$ LDM with full screen erase
codeout ldm,dot,write,full
*sec/60 LDM setting to dot ¬+ write mode and erasing screen
codeout lde $$ LDE echoing a key that can break a pause
codeout ldy,exp $$ LDC to terminal y register?exp
codeout exp $$ sends out a data word containing exp

The system could keep tabs on the state of the terminal

The article is a good one in most respects and I hope it
is accepted. The main criticism which the Science
reviewers might take issue with is the "failure" to
make it explicitly clear how PLATO relates to other
work in the field. With a general summary article like
this one, such a possible criticism really misses the
mark since a review of the literature in addition to
a description of PLATO is too long for a Science article.
I hope the lack of reference to related work doesn't
cause this paper any political problems. While PLATO's
contribution to the state-of-the-art may not be clear
to the average Science reader, it should certainly be
clear to those involved in interactive computer systems.

Incidently, this set of notes is an excellent example of
the primitive state of development of PLATO's potential
as a communications medium. The last time I was intensely
involved with conferencing on plato, datasets were not
available for general use. Their current availability makes
it possible for the smith-sherwood article (text and
graphics) to be stored in a dataset along with reader
comments keyed (threaded) to the text. Rather than
saying 'Bruce, I think you should rephrase the ambigiouity
in line 5, block Q, part 10', the conferencing program
would take care of the text flagging and access to the
reader comment. Also, it would be just as easy to make
reference to a graph or line drawing. Non-plato authors
could use such a system. Commenting on papers is only
one of many applications for conferencing facilities.

Well, I could go on for ever on this topic, but I think I
will cut it short. I just wanted to emphasize that there
are many exciting possibilities beyond 'talk' and 'notes'.
Someday graduate students may use plato to participate
in current scientific debates or perhaps "meet" with a
geographically dispersed prelim committee. Stan and
Bruce might submit their paper to Science with merely
a -SHIFT- -NEXT-, and receive the referee's comments
a few days later. I'm sorry I don't have all of this
working yet. The large demands such conferencing
facilities would place on ecs suggests that a
system-level effort would be required to make such
activities truly viable.

In experimenting with linesets it becomes apparent that
lines are not always enough to represent certain figures
that would greatly benefit from sizing and rotation.
Circles and arcs are also necessary for some chars. Would
it be possible to add these as options. I realize that the
driving machinery may not allow this. Perhaps with the
advent of an -rcircle- command the code would be possible.

I know that the various figures that I need may be done with

more useful if they could be done in linesets.

Remember that in addition to providing information to the
cataloging staff (for description of your materials to
outsiders or interested PLATO people), the DATA display
also allows the system staff to contact you in emergency
situations (as when some failure has wiped out a portion
of a file and there is an option to replace it with a
back-up copy or warn you in time to repair it by hand).
Most can ultimately be tracked down but one tends to
assume that the ones with "cute" content or usage
descriptions and an indication that "the phantom" is the
responsible individual are not serious and can be left
until time is available from more important things.

Certainly Tebby and her helpers should not have to bear
the costs of incomplete data pages. Perhaps the catalogers
should be given the power to change all the codes on a
lesson to some special code that will prevent anyone from
changing, inspecting, etc until the special code is cleared.
This would both turn up the owners of such lessons and also
distribute the costs of the original carelessness more
appropriately.

Since there are almost 900 courses and many "courses" are
simply groups of people in which each might be doing some-
thing different and since such information is not static,
it would be too time-consuming to compile such a list.

of lessons of a certain type it would make it a lot easier.

Hardware and Software Considerations in Computer Based
Course Management

by...Stephen M. Alessi, Thomas H. Andersen, and
W. Barry Biddle

University of Illinois Laboratory for Cognitive Studies in
Education...Technical Report No.4...Nov. 1975

ABSTRACT: A computer based course management system
(CAISMS II) was designed to integrate books, computers, and
live teachers in an effective manner. The system is
intended for courses with large numbers of students and
instructors such as introductory courses in community
college, university, or military settings. We here describe
the course management system and its hardware/software
organization as it was developed and implemented on the
PLATO IV computer based instructional system at the U of I.

I think that it is unfair to be caught in a long range
tractor beam when one uses a strategy of staying near
a star base to stay alive, especially in the master
category. There is, for all intent and purposes, no way
to arrive at your new destination with any hope of
surviving an attack, especially with the controls
available. Specifically, I am referring to the
impossibility of lowering shields and firing
phasers in one move, or even photon torpedos, before
enough damage is done to make such strategy worthless.
Indeed, had the real Enterprise had such outdated
controls, Engineer Scott would have developed more
modern ones, or the ship would never have lasted
more than one television season.

Now that linesets have come into being, there is clearly
no further use for lessons "linechar" and "olinechar".

I intend to delete them within the next few days, and
put the space to new and "exciting" uses.

So, if you are using one of these relics, and have some
editing to do on them, you had best do it real soon,

That number doesn't include notes, records (2 lessons, I

Over the past 2 years I have recieved a few requests for
information on how to use the gothic charset in lesson
charsett. Now, with the introduction of linesets, I have
decided that it might be worth a lesson.

Lesson -gothic- now contains information on how to use
both the lineset and charset, both for regular letters and
illuminated capitals, as well as an assortment of examples
of both.

I have made improvements to the gothic charset, and the
new improved version is also in lesson gothic with the
lineset. The improvements include an aditional capital
as well as cleaning up some inconsistancies in the charsett
version that were pointed out over the last 2 years.

where you press NEXT1 to _inspect_ your code--even
        if your security codes the lesson change code

function on the error page as it does from its help page?

---------- response 1
  11/25     13.20     jim       pso

when you press HELP from the execution error display, you
get into part of AIDS --- a -jumpout return- in your
lesson returns you to the lesson you can from (AIDS exec
error lesson). in the i.e.u. of the AIDS exec error lesson,
i look to see if you're from AIDS --- and since you're
not, you goto the beginning of AIDS. the initial HELP key
does not send you to the beginning of AIDS because you are
coming from the exec error display. hope that helps-----

        i don't see a way to get around it. students never
see the exec error display ¬+ you should never be surprised
where a -jumpout return- takes you.

I guess I am the one with the big hang-up agaist using
prefixes to form a new but similar command to one already
existing. My basic premise is...that there are several
hundred TUTOR commands. We should try to keep commands that
are highly similar similar in name. This is _NOT_ done by
adding prefixes. If someone knows of the -touch- command...
they will probably immediately know what a -touchno- command
does. And they can probably get info about related commands
in AIDS...if the names start alike.
Think of "write/writec" and "answer/answerc"...the basic
idea is that they do writing and answer judging and that
the "c" at the end is an addition to the main features of
these commands. To me, the first part of a command name
holds most importance and should. The minor additions
should be just that...and at the end.

        It would be quite convenient for students to be able
to intersperse constants (numbers ¬+ maybe string constants)
in responses to be judged by -concept-. For instance:
given
  vocabs words, <of,and,is,the>
         (operation,sum=1,difference=2,...)

   ¬6 sum of 4 and 56.6 is 60.6
would be matched by

  concept operation (v2) (v3) (v4), n1?operation

        I should point out that the teaching method referred
to in earlier responses as the "Platonic" method is actually
the "Socratic" method. Plato was the formost student of
Socrates, who was famous for teaching by the use of pithy
questions. It is an unfortunate fact of history that none
of Socrates' writings survived the Dark Ages. All we know
of his philosophy comes to us through the works of Plato,
which fortunately _did_ survive.

       And I like "automated" better than "automatic".

Just to set the record straight: Socrates as interpreted
by Plato thought that all learning is remembering. The
"Socratic" method of dialogue (dialectic) is a device
to help the "learner" remember something he knew all along.
There are few learning theorists today who would seriously
subscribe to such an oversimplification. However, there
is a modern viewpoint which could be construed as a
comtemporary reinterpretation of Socrates. It is the
gestalt theory of learning wherein learing is a "discovery"
of how all the pieces fit together. Thus, under this
new interpretation our job is to provide the proper
environment to help students discover things for themselves
.....hopefully with some enthusiasum as an accompanyment.
I think it was Whitehead who said all Western Philosophy is
footnotes to Plato.

We have repeatedly aborted common and then found the
common was still in ECS. We went into the common block
and hit SHIFT-LAB. Then using the R option from the
Author Mode page, we were able to return the aborted
common to disk, indicating that the common was still in
ECS. (No one was in the lesson at this time.)

Our only guess as to what is happening is that as
long as the lesson is hanging around in ECS. the old
(aborted) copy of the common is still available.

We need to abort the common repeatedly as this is the
only way we can simulate a system crash.

Steve/cornell suggested that the common will be aborted
when the ECS copy of the lesson is deleted.

This may be true. If so, we must then wait around
until the lesson goes away or we must force a recondense of
the lesson without the common command.

1) Neither of these solutions is appealing. Could
something better be implemented?

2) If this is the way abort common works, there shouldn't
be a message saying:

   Your common with be aborted when your lesson leaves
   ECS.

The common stays in ECS until the lessons using are deleted
from ECS either through all users exiting and the space
being needed or through all using lessons being explicitly
recondensed. I believe that any lesson recondensed after
its common is aborted will operate on a new copy of the
common even though other non-recondensed lessons operate on
the old (and invisibly renamed) copy.

I do not agree that this should be changed. Aborted commons
are useful for (1) testing new lessons that manipulate
important common data bases, (2) continuing to run various
lessons though one portion of the common has been damaged
ans should not be returned to disk
Also, consider the system-degrading effects of an -abort-
command in a tight loop if each abort fetched a new common
from disk.

GADS! I think that abort common should stay as it is!
(or perhaps delete all lessons using the common, or
something like that)
I have found it useful to have an abort common as the
first thing in a lesson to make sure that its not written
back to disk (making it read only), but still wishing to
change common while in the lesson. (calc nc1?nc1+1) type
things, and have it actually not be time slice dependant.

Marshall,

I was not talking about the -abort- common command but
rather the abort common option in the common block.

I am not concerned about changing the -abort- command.
Rather, when I exercise the abort option in the lesson's
common block, I would like the common aborted at that time========_==_ ____ ____.
If this cannot be done, should not the system display the
warning message I suggested a few notes previous?

Let ME explain: What we want to do is KILL...ANIHILATE...

.....DESTROY the ECS copy of the common. Not only do we
not want it returned to disc, we don't want it, period.
We want to force the system to get a fresh copy of the
common from disk the next time someone enters the lesson,
such that any -initial common- units in the program are
executed. This is no big deal during peak system periods,
when the ECS the aborted common occupies is likely to be
re-allocated within seconds after the last student
leaves the lesson, but last friday night, when our site
alone had 100000 words of ECS allocated, an aborted copy
of common haunted me for hours. All I want is to be able
to blast the varmint out of ECS, so I can get a fresh
copy of the common. I don't care if an engineer has to
pull a handfull of core out of ECS; I just want to disown
the old common.

---------- response 7
  11/26     14.18     white       p
The intention of -abort common- is to allow an author
to keep a messed up copy of a common from being
written back to disk. If you want a fresh copy of
a common from disk, you have to tell the system
it is a different common from that in ECS. To
indicate a different common, all you need to do
is change the name of the common and recondense
the lesson.

When you return an aborted common to disk, it
is not written to disk. However, no error
indication is given.

        Consider the problem from this standpoint, Joe --
you abort the common from ECS (disown it) and, assuming
there is _1_ lesson using the common, all is well. Now, if
there are _2_ lessons using the common, the next time the
common is referenced but the other, still running, lesson,
weird things could happen.
      Somehow I think you're causing more problems than
you solved. I'd rather have a lesson operate on a "doomed"
common for a period that suddenly get given a completely
ancient set of parameters, who may or may not be relevant
to the recent "history" of the running program.

---------- response 3

The advantage is that at present a command such as
at     n1
erase  40.3
will act very strangely if n1=100x+y¬[1<x<24,y>26¬]
Example, if n1=230, this command will erase
36 chars on 3 alternate======__=_________ lines, and 4 chars on the others.
Perhaps a more convenient way of doing this would be to
change the action after a line of a 2-arg erase command
from a simple CR key to an
at x,y-16 $$ x and y start of last line
I, too, feel that it would be a shame to ignore spaces
which go beyond the end line.

---------- response 4
  11/26     13.51     b sherwood       s

This proposed change is related to implementing "block
erase" on new (intelligent) terminals, where a block is
really a rectangle, not a patchwork of pieces.

It is perhaps understandable that at present the erase
command should wrap around in a strange way, since it is
essentially just a "write spaces" in rewrite mode, but it
doesn't make sense for the future. I think we should
announce that the change will be made after a month or
so, during which time you might search your lessons for
-erase- commands, if you use the present wrap-around
features.

I have a number of

type commands in lessons that antedated the 2 tag
erase, but I haven't the least idea where. As a 
minimum, I would hope that the system would automatically
fix all those erase commands that have no variable
in them such as the above example, and put a warning
on the "last edited by" page of other lessons, or
a temporary condense warning for erases containing
variables.

---------- response 6
  11/27     12.46     john r       reading

Absolutely. Checking all the erase commands of several
hundred lessons by hand is not an easy or a quick job.
I would think an appropriate system fix would, at a minimum,
be a program that does an X search through all the lessons
in an account and lists all erase commands with tags
greater than 63.

---------- response 7
  11/30     23.51     mckeown       com
I agree in general with the previous replies suggesting
that system action is appropriate here. I really see no
reason why a system level conversion could not be done to
ALL situations where an erase command begins at a fixed
screen position and has a fixed tag (regardless of whether
that tag exceeds 63).?
I would further like to point out that requiring the use
of block erase for multiple line erases is going to make
erasing unknown lengths quite messy. I don't even know how
to do it in one command unless I am willing to set a maximum
and block erase all that every time (quite slow until the
hardware block erase is implemented). Further, trying to do
it in two commands may run afoul of the new non-resetting of
*where* after an erase.?
I would suggest that the imminence of hardward block erase
does not require the obsolescence of one tag multiple line
erases (at least at this stage).

Urggg...even an automatic lesson search would not

Why not leave the -erase v1- action as it is now and

need to alter the output list function code) but this

student performance data:

a) It would be EXTREMELY nice if we had a complement in

b) If there were a systems-level utility lesson for data-

        As a newcomer to accounts, I think several points
in the lesson need some revision. First:
        When the lessons in the account file are listed,
the size of each lesson should be listed somewhere. This
becomes somewhat critical when lesson space becomes tight,
and for some file types, i.e. notes files, the size of the
file is not listed anywhere!
        There also should be a way of accessing the DATA
page of lessons in "INSPECT ONLY" mode. This is especially
necessary in the case of "pirated" lessons, since the last
editor is updated by any account action and the identity
of the "pirate" is lost.
        The last-editor information from "acounts" needs
to be entered in the same format as it is in the editor.
That it is not if proved by changing a codeword through
"accounts", then immediately entering the lesson to be
told "Last edited by" yourself!¬D

---------- note 416 accounts 2

        Finally, a hole exists in the security of "accounts"
which can be resolved by returning the ordinal numbers from
course records. This is how a person with author access to
my course got temporary control of my account (no damage
was done...)
        He changed the _name_ of my signon to garbage. Then
he added a new signon, with my name but his password. When
he entered "accounts" under this signon, the lesson let him
in as if he were me, the account director. Finally, he
destroyed the temporary signon and renamed my signon as me,
leaving no trace of his entry but in the "Log of operations"
of the account.

---------- response 1

Perhaps a course peopled by account directors only should
be created and controlled by CERL. It is relatively easy
to guarantee that no one will use my records except by
tampering with them through the system course editor. But
most account directors have signons in courses which are
editable -- legitimately so -- by others. Considering the
extent of powers held by an account director, it would seem
a good idea to plug up this small loophole.

---------- response 2

How about just putting a special "lock" on the records
of the director?! Such a "lock" could only be altered
by systems personnel; when set, no one (except the director)
could make any changes to his records. It would, in
effect, be a fifth type of user record.

That's an interesting idea... since the account

the above seems to be cumbersome in the use of touch
panels. How about numbering the touch squares i thru 162?

Why does the enable have to be used with touch,slide
has been simplified?

Why can't the following be made to work?

        unit   unitname
        touchb square number;square number;12,23;etc
        jump   unit1;unit2;unit3;unit4; etc

have the touch command enable the touch pannel and have
the jump command(or jumpt) disable the touch panel?
   This way, we could eliminate the need for an arrow in
branching. We could throw away the enable and disable
commands completely when the touch panel is used.
  How about a notes file to discuss the future direction and
needs of the touch panel users?

this may be an ignorant comment, but why not have a

character- spaced addressing?

What john is trying to say is he is in the process of
writing a lesson that uses the touch panel, and is finding
the existing touch commands quite ...ah...incomplete.
The touch command in particular seems to be aimed at use
with an arrow(¬+ c. grid), but using the touch panel along
with normal key input seems to be a special use -- namely,
we haven't even decided on a numbering scheme for the
grid as yet(yes, we know the x,y components are stored in
"key") Why not decide on a numbering scheme, for example:
numbering 0 to 255(as with the fiche) and the top left
(or should it be bottom left?) is 0 (or 1?). Anyways, I
think you can see that we don't really feel like writing
a lot of touch panel lessons, then later have to go back
and rewrite them all. If you are working on this how about
let's discuss this thing in a notes file somewhere with
(cont.)

some projections as to _when_ ¬+ _what_ types of things will
be available.????? At least we will be better able to
organize our present code to minimize the hassel when the
new stuff is added.

Some more suggestions:
  A Insert Touch and Show Touch addition to the editor,
which could put up the grid, and allow editing of touch
-groups-(coming soon we hope). Here each touch location
named in the group would be filled in with the group name,
and locations could be added or deleted from each group.

 A graphic group command to display which sections of the
grid are active in the lesson, for the students information.

Some people use the enable and disable commands to do
exactly as they say - selectively enable and disable
the touch panel.

I don't want to see any commands changed such that
some of them enable, while others disable. I would
lose control over my programmed material.

You can use TERM grid in ID mode to see a touch panel

so the afore mentioned location of 1515,3,2...would

You could write your own -term clean- unit and stick it
in all of your lessons. Pressing TERM puts the student
into a special type of sequence, which occasionally
can mess up the intended flow of your lesson. If you
make your own -term clean-, you would be more aware of
possible problems, and better able to fix them should they
arise.

You might want the "clean" unit to reload your charset
at the same time it cleans. I understand that bad
charsets are a problem for remote sites, too.

What he is saying is not only for students. Often, authors
have the same problem while editing or using a lesson.
At this site, at least, there are many times when a
line error occurs which messes up the screen, and we press
the clear key. Then the error light goes on, and the
terminal goes into altfont. When in a bad day, this can
become very aggravating, having to take the time every
five minutes to go back to where you can replot the screen;
hitting the clear key messes up the screen more than
the line error did.

I feel that a feature like this, where NO error would
occur while trying to clear the screen, would be a great
help to remote students AND authors.

        You can send them all a blank message. This will

It will not,  unfortunately, save them the stop at the
message page on the way in.  Perhaps a better procedure
(with present facilities) is to leave a message saying
that there is no message at this time.
        Probably the simplest implementation of the desired

I would like to continue the -touch-discussion ....
Please read Gen. Notes 425 and 445 for background.

Topic One:
I am against having -touch- numbered from 1-256 because
1) there are already two screen-location grids to remember
2) whereas both coarse-grid "1217" and fine-grid 200,200
   have physical meaning which I can picture in my mind,
   -touch 149- (for 149?th?? square) has no meaning to me--
   I cannot readily convert numbers modulo 16.
3) -touch- locations are almost always coordinated with
   text and/or line drawings, as in
TOUCH HERE
TO CONTINUE
The -touch- address should be easy to relate to the
text address.

---------- response 1
  12/01     10.17     judy       pso

Topic Two:
I would like to see the present one- and two- tag -touch-
commands dropped. I feel that most people use the three-tag
form and that many users do not understand how the one-
and two- tag forms work.

Then, (necessarily after a suitable "waiting period")
I would like to see -touch- changed so that a one-tag
form would be equivalent to: -touch location,1,1-

Topic Three:
A -touch- initiated "help" and "helpop" would be very nice
indeed. But rather than Gary's suggested format, wouldn't
you need
thelpop location,unit $$ to specify touch position
or
thelpop location,xtolerance,ytolerance;unit

And how would you write it when the "unit" needed to be
conditional?

---------- response 2
  12/01     10.51     michael       english

I agree with Judy's observations on the 1,2 and 3 argument
forms of the current -touch- command. It must be kept in
mind that the current -touch- is a judging command, not a
definable function key as I am proposing. In line with the
current treatment of function keys, a touch-based student
branching key should set a pointer to a specific unit when
the command is encountered, as does -help: this is the
reason that argumented function key jumps are not allowed.
A possible format for such a command might be:

thelp condition;unit1,201,2,1;unit2,(601,1,1;801,4,1)

In this case, if "condition" is true, the touch unit pointer
is set to "unit1"; a later touch at 201,2,1 will cause a
help-type jump to it. If it were false, the pointed to unit
would be "unit2". which would be reached by a touch at 601,
1,1 OR 801,4,1.

CONTINUED

---------- response 3
  12/01     10.53     silver       ve

An alternative would be a command which set certain touch
locations equivalent to a key:
touchk help,1205,5,1;data,505,1,1
etc. leaving present branching commands unchanged.
(in format). Would this work?

---------- response 4
  12/01     11.07     michael       english

I realize that the proposed format allows three levels of
separators, but they are needed -- and many of the answer
judging commands provide a precedent for it.

Two problems arise:

1) Touch areas may conflict. The execution of a touch-
jump should involve a left-to-right scan of the subarguments
of the command, and the first area that includes the just
touched coordinate satisfies the search. The -keytype-
command is analogous to this.

2) A -thelp- may be in effect at an -arrow- which also has
-touch- commands below it. The search for a branching touch
key should occur first, then the arrow can be processed
normally if no t-jump was executed.

Lastly, the above procedure could be easily extended to
allow the commands to operate on defined touch groups.

what about???
I like the touch grid numbered from 1 thru 162.
Problems with using the present grid system include:
touch is counted from the bottom left corner like fe
fine grid.
Using course grid coordinates adds undue complexity
to using it in the same way,,so,,users have to learn
another set of grid components anyway.(sorry judy)
   What about the following:

Pause  touch=101,1,2;data;324,1;5,1,1;help;touchno
OR
Pause  touch=101,1,2¬,data¬,324,1¬,5,1,1¬,help¬,touchno

*concerning the touch grid...the exercise of learning
an entirely unique grid just for touch is seemingly
unnecessary. as with memorizing multiplication tables...
once one has tussled with the touch locations and gotten
the picture firmly stuck in the brain, a new system is
not very attractive. (unless some super benefits can
be reaped by installing a new system)

*the use of 1,2 or 3 argument -touch- statements is a
similar example of usage breeding familiarity...
i for one, heavily use the 2 and the 3 argument touches
and the differences between them are significant enuf
to spur me to ask judy, why she would favor getting
rid of them...in favor of some other locus touch system.
most of the touch routines done here, are in relation to
diagram that have structures to be identified that some-
times don't conveniently land on text lines...thus the
2 and 3 argument touches are used for more flexi

touch location=key
I would prefere a command which sets touch locations equal
to keys,the command would be in effect untill cleared.
All touches would the have the keycode of the key they are
equal to. No special commands would be needed for
for pauses, help units,etc.

For example.

unit   test
tkeys  location1=help,location2=a
helpop helpu
arrow  1010
long   1
answer a
...

Pressing location1 or the help key would cause unit
helpu to be done. Pressing location2 would couse a
to be written at the arrow and judged ok.

Discussion of the form of touch commands needs to consider
the very different character of the student interaction
with touch compared to keyset imput. For example, when
you ask the student to touch something or point at something
an arrow plotted on the screen has little meaning.
Hence code contains inhibit arrow. Also, ok and no
are not as usefull for touch and we always write specs
nookno. If the student makes an error, it is nice to
have a message of some kind which goes away when he does
the right thing. But, the automatic -no- answer stuff
is of little value because you tend to just touch the
right answer after an error instead of pressing NEXT.
So -no- is followed by judge ignore and some author
generated code to do what is done automatically for keyset
inputs. A structure which makes it easier to generate
student screen touch interactions is more important than
branching.

Stan... What you are wanting is something like
-force firsterase-, which would work "reasonably"
for -touch-es? Me, too!

Jan: No, I definitely do not propose dropping the 3-tag
-touch-! The problem which arises is that the 2-tag
touch encompasses an area AROUND the tag given, so that
touch 1233,2 is FOUR squares wide and FOUR squares tall
but
touch 1233,2,2 is only TWO squares by TWO squares.
This seems confusing to me, and the single extra tag not
an excessive burden to bear in order to make it less
confusing.

I agree that using coarse grid to specify touch locations
is extremely cumbersome. I also agree that in many cases
where the default options active at an arrow are not
necessary, it would be useful not to have to inhibit the
arrow, turn off ok/no, judge ignore, etc. For cases like
this, weVe discussed something like:

pause   keys=touch
keytype (tkey),touch(0,4),touch(1,5)

where the touch coordinates are given in touch grid.
Possible additions would include allowing touch
areas (more than one touch square) to be specified in the
-group- command.

I agree that a crucial question is how easy it is to
position text at a appropriate screen locations -- I think
that simply having the touch grid available in SD takes
care of some of this.

I would rather stick with the arrow and branching machinery.
After much -inhibit-ing of arrows, I put them back on the
screen again, because they still come in handy!
There are still 200+ terminals which will not have touch
panels in the foreseeable future. Also -- sometimes touch
panels don't work (not often, but it happens). One of the
biggest complaints about a particular set of diagnosis pro-
grams was that no keyboard equivalents were given for touch
commands. So I number diagrams and stuff like that --
Finagle will get you, if you don't. There are situations
where not having a touch panel takes all the fun out of
the lesson, but this is a rarer situation than I used to
think.

   Since it is conceivable that the "fineness" of
the touch equipment might sometime change, putting in
some other grid based upon current capabilities is
just asking for trouble (as well as the confusion that
will be generated by yet another co-ordinate scheme). We
want the specifications for touch areas somehow linked
to current ways of specifying display position.

Aw, booo... You don't want to create another coordinate
system, but you are already _mixing_ them in the -touch-
command -- you don't refer to the width or height of the
area in terms of course grid unit! Why can't we approach
the use of the touch panel as if we are interested in using
the touch panel for it's own sake, not just as an added
option to existing lessons? I am assuming the panel will
be checked out before entering the lesson-- and that those
who need them will have them. Also I am assuming that
the problem of remembering coordinate locations for those
who are doing standard types of things will be handled
as it is now -- with the computer generating the code from
a Service type routine.

perhaps what we can do is consider what is already
available in the touch machinery...e.g.
use a combination of what the "key" variable receives
as a value when a location is "touched" ...and
also using that as a tag for the -touch- command

thus: -touch- 511 (would render the top right corner
                   active, and then branching via
                   key=511 would be useful immediately)

at first glance this useage has at least one drawback...
the variable sizes of the touch square will have to be
generated some way, since one touch square alone is
hard to hit by most fingers!

have you ever tried judging some 2 square touch areas
which are randomly generated, and giving feedback on
the incorrect responses?
   That is really a bucket of worms while using the
keycodes...There seems to be a hangup with trying to
use a touch area and give it the designation of a
keycode. If touch doesn't get easier, it will not
be used and the pannels will rot away.
   We should think of the touch pannel as an alternate
input method into the computer, not a slave of the
keyboard...It is very useful because it is an alternative
to spelling and typing.It is not useful when it is more
difficult than the keyset...for students and authors alike.

Unless you really want to process ALL keys (including,

on your -pause-; then you can decide (in the tag) whether
you want touch, or whatever, to break the pause.?
Blank-tag -pause- should be thought of as an exceptional
use of -pause-, not the normal use.

every time there is reason to contact a Site and/or a
Course Director. "Network" gives mailing addresses and
phone ¬$s of Site (but not Course) Directors, but surely it
would be easier to contact them direct === ly through pnotes.

The major problem is that such names are under control of
the course directors (and hence subject to rapid change).
The churning of course names is wonderous to behold in
itself. Thus, in the absence of a routine that gallops
through all courses to compile an up-to-date list at each
request, it is easier for Tebby to serve as an information
resource.

Unfortunately, the most responsible (site directors) are
not always the ones that people want to contact. There are
many one-semester courses that have in the past tended to
become pirates after the real students were done. Some of
these changed course directors on a daily basis.
They have also been used at sites which have nothing to
do with the original use of the course.
In addition, a geographical site (we have about 200 of them)
often has several people responsible for different things.
Some of these people (believe it or not) don't talk to each
other. Tebby is aware of who should be seen, who is on
sabbatical, etc. or can track this information down in a
specific case. To maintain the same information on all
sites would take more of her time than could be justified.

        This problem would be solved for courses by having
the information page available without inspect code. A
similar change for lessons would let one know the name of
the author. I presume that a similar info page is provided
for a site. though not being a site director, I do not know.
It may be necessary to change the info pages slightly to
provide the signon name as well as the full name and address
of the individual. The responsibility of keeping this up to
date would fall where it should - on the director.
        I would have no objection to a shortened info page.
Security code info, for example, should not be needed, nor
references to other lessons (router, instructor file, data
file, use reference, etc.). The "last editied by" info
would be useful to contact an alternate person if the
director were unavailable. ¬??W¬=??C¬=??D

It seems to me that the lack of malicious use of this in-

stole it. On the other hand that someone would discover
such an error and not report it IS disturbing and I wonder
just what the systems people have done to determine the
identity of this non-malicious plato user. (After all
shouldn't he receive some sort of award for his virtue?)

        The last respondent should re-read the note. The
error has been corrected and apparently was corrected quite
some time ago. The note did _not_ say that Systems was not
informed of the error that permitted this breach of
security. Apparently the only information that was with-
held from the systems programmers was that fact that
security codes had been gotten.

  12/02     10.39     keith s       matha

What kind of CPU advantage would result from a system
implementation of a -sum- command with a format similar to
the following?

sum var1,¬$ of vars,result var,opt'l step size,opt'l mask

Example:

sum n1,150,n2,2,077

would sum the last 6 bits of the odd-numbered n variables
from n1 to n149 and place the result in n2.

The savings I see lie perhaps in the elimination of bounds
checks that must be done every time a -calc- is executed
in a -doto- loop. Correct? Any others? It seems this
application occurs often enough to warrant some discussion.

I am aware of the array machinery, but the array Sum
function does not seem as general as might be desirable,
e.g., as far as I can tell does not allow summation of
every nth element of a vector, where n>1. This might
be useful when dealing with y-word packages, where the
xth word of each package is a quantity to be used in a
summation.

do you think this might cause line error problems?
remote sites often seem to get "bad" phone lines for
a period of time, resulting in unacceptable red light
problems. sometimes it requires much negotiation with
ma bell, including re-routing lines, changing equipment
along the line , etc. before the problems are solved.
unless the remote sites get exactly the same routing as
before the cutoff, i would expect several sites to have
to go through this line cleanup process starting the
tenth of jan. not that i think that avoidance of such
problems would be worth the cost of keeping the lines up.

with what you decide.

---------- response 5

I agree with others who have mentioned problems with
phone lines as a possible result of cancelling the
lines duration the down period to save money. I hope
that in your negotiations with MABEL you have
considered this. Further, since the cost of the line
can vary depending on the routing used (i.e. how
much milage gets GSA retes, how many terminations, etc.)
what gaurentee can you get from ATT that line charges
on a monthly basis will not increase when the lines
are reinstalled? As one of the PLATO sites with a
high phone bill, I'm certainly interested in saving
money...BUT I don't want to see interference with
service or higher monthly bills later...

     AT+T would not be the cause of higher rates, but GSA
(Federal General Services Administration) might be, as they
allow sharing of their lines by the state govt's with the
Feds getting priority, GSA routing incurrs the chance
of getting "bumped" in any case, temporary disconnect or
not. GSA routing is roulette at all times. Lines routed
via GSA are routed that way because experience has shown
that those certain routes have been bumped less in the
past.

Anytime new chars a loaded into the terminal, the old
ones are overwritten, and thus lost. Besides, whenever
you sign off, your charset flag is cleared and you will
have to reload your charset anyway. The computer can't
know what your terminal has been doing since you were
signed in -- for all it knows, you may have done something
like loaded in a mencrah or something!

---------- response 2
  12/03     11.54     marty       mfl

You don't have to reload your charset if you are
checking lessons and sign in and out repeatedly.
Am only saying that today -whenever the display is
shown- I must wait for the reloading to take place.

This is particularly annoying when one is giving
a demonstration using several lessons (all with
the same charset). Having to wait for the charset
to reload does interfere with the demonstration.
This is a complaint I have had before; the displays
ought not to slow down the sign-in procedure or
interfere with one's normal working habits.

---------- response 3
  12/03     12.41     mike b       cornell

        The only way you can avoid reloading your charset
after signing off and back on is if the lesson you enter has
the STOP key active at the charload (or if there is no loop-
back to the load on zreturn>-1). Otherwise, since signing
off _does_ clear the charset pointer, you would be forced to
reload. However, the above assumes that no new characters
are loaded during the period you are signed off. In that
case, although the STOP key will allow you to bypass the
charload, your charset will be screwed up. The reason the
Thanksgiving and Holloween (and Mickey's Birthday) displays
don't screw up your charset is that they are line-drawn
figures, not characters.

One thing that CAN be easily done in to put the special
display characters way,way at the end of the charset
instead of into a,b,c,d as the Chanukah set is stored.

_Very_ few people use the Not linked" characters. If they
were overloaded from the Welcome page, it would not matter
to people who want to sign in-and-out. For larger displays,
the font-access-shift-letters (14 of them) are not very
popular, since they are rather a pain to type.

Anything can happen when the terminal is signed off the
system. The terminal can be turned off, or signed on
somewhere else, or even changed to another port --
losing charset information in any case. When the terminal
is signed on, at least its condition can be usually
sensed.
        (Note: signing out of a _lesson_ to the
AUTHOR MODE page should not destroy the charset info.
Only going all the way back to Press NEXT to Begin
should clear the charset.

I decided to try and make up a solution to the blank
screen problem before the WELCOME TO PLATO page while
the menorah (I hope it is spelled right) is in use.
This temporarily resides in "logoproc," There is no
inspect code, so you can see my stupid way of doing
it. If it is faster, or even the same speed as loading
the characters at first, and you like the method, tell
your favorite system programmer you would like to see
it in the next version.

Thanks,
Bob Broadus

p,s. Notice that it only uses one character. I thought
very few lessons use the arrow any more so currently
that is what I am using. It could be changed to
any character. This takes care of the ruined charset
problem too.

---------- response 11
  12/06     20.28     dowling       ames

        I second the suggestion of broadus of css. Using
only one character would reduce the nuisance of the reload.
        I would suggest, however, that the one character be
character number 0, the space, and that after the display,
one additional char command, -char 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0- be
executed to restore this character to its normal empty self.
Few charsets override this char., and so the nuisance would
be minimized, Furthermore. I would presume that on loading
a charset, the chars are normally loaded in order. Thus if
the loading were terminated by pressing STOP, this char.
would nearly always be loaded.
        There should be no need for the inhibit charclear,
for the flag is already cleared by the signoff - signin.
        I would further suggest this technique on the
exploding not in P-notes.

There seems to be a small repeatable error in the old
general notes file.

Enter old general notes (option f), and press 'a' for notes
after 11/19/75. Go to note ¬$348. Press LAB, and the first
response appears; press LAB a second time, and second
response appears. Fine. Press LAB a third time to go on
to the next response (or note) and you are bounced out to
the note index. There it says the note ¬$348, of 11/25
has three responses. However, when you attempt to access
the third reponse, you are bounced out. This also happens
when you attempt to access the third response by pressing
'3' from the note itself.

If there is no third response, or if it is not available,
then it seems that pressing LAB should take one onto the

Speaking of security codes and the like, it would seem
rather logical to be able to access the data page of a
lesson even if you dont have the inspect code. Not all
authors leave their names and/or sinons in the lesson,
and if you should want to see the lesson, this way you
could at least find out who to contact.
Another '?' for this is that if someone gets into your

codes are "none - open to all", or the name of the use
reference.

Perhaps those who need more security could be given the
privilege of restricting the display of this info, in which
case (and only in this case), the s, o, p, or pso people

the option of restricting the information.
       At the _very_ least, someone without the inspect code

author without having to bug cerl staff for it. I'm not
sure I understand the need to keep real names, phone numbers
and department affiliations "private" (what are people
worried about? crank calls and threats to kidnap their

anyone could then get the info by typing in the lesson name,

Another possible key might be the ANS key for the answer

I just list the titles of major lessons I have written,
under the heading "PLATO lessons". And of course I do
mean "titles", not file names, which would be gibberish.
If the vita is sent to a place where there is no PLATO,
you'll have to explain somehow what a PLATO lesson is.
What problems do you find in referencing such lessons?

I just wish to say that among the many additions to lesson
editing that have been made, a few facts have been over-
looked. for example, i am very fond of using the rdraw in
ID mode. But, the other day I used the ID for rdrawing a
rahter large figure, and it started going off the screen.
So, I inserted a size command in the SD mode thinking that
after the SD switched over to the ID mode, the size would
allow additions to the drawing in proportion to the rest.
I found that I was wrong. It sure would be nice to allow
the last size command to be used as a magnification factor
for the x-,y-coordinates in the ID mode. Don't you agree?
Sincerely Yours,
John L. Stratton

It sounds like you want something similar to -rdraw-.
SD/ID is capable of generating and displaying -rdraw-s,
which are drawings which CAN be sized. Go into AIDS
and type DATA ¬D rdraw.

---------- response 2
  12/03     15.59     stratton       pfw

Nope. that's not what I mean.....
I meant to say that after rdrawing in one size, a person
cannot change size and continue adding to the drawing in
the proper proportion.(i.e.,draw half of a large drawing
in size 0, rdraw mode. Then size it down, look at it in
the SD mode. Then, when it automatically flips over to
the ID mode, try adding to the drawing in the new size.
It won't be in proprotion to the first part when looked
at again in SD mode. What I meant to ask was, ""can a
change be made in the ID part of the editor so to use
the size as a magnifier of the coordinates placed in the
program to rdraw the figure?!

The audio device now appears (see gen note 57) to be usable
on a routine basis. The purpose of this note is to suggest
that this fact has significance far beyond the special uses
where an audio is absolutely necessary (foreign languages,
beginning reading, etc.). When/if the audio becomes common,
I believe it can transfore PLATO as a teaching medium. It
can do this by relieving the learner's eyes of some textual
information (eg, directions) so that he can attend more
effectively to other screen info of to a practical situa-
ion (eg, in a lab or shop). Though cost will restrict the
availability of audios for some time, I think exploratory
work might profitably begin now. The possibilities are
wide ranging, including, as Marty Siegel pointed out to me,
the training of authors and instructors. Look at your les-
sons: how could they be different if they exploited audio?

One person has suggested to me the our voice input could

PLATO to act as a workbook for somebody servicing or
learning about a piece of mechanical equipment. The input
would allow one to ask for help or turn pages while actually
handling some equipment.

Also the touch panel has been somewhat neglected -- how

But there are still many logistics problems associated
with the various hardware. Also, many people fail to
recognize that without the system software support
we have grown accustomed to, the hardware will
remain unused. This is by no means a criticism of the

Analog Audio Respnse Devicesz

The simplest analog audio response device is a tape recorder
that is turned on and off by the terminal. The simplest
practical device is one which allows random access to
messages instead of the serial access that a simple tape
recorder offers. As far as I know the least expensive
such practical device now available is PLATO's.

The message for such a device is made by a human recording
his/her voice on the disk, drum, or tape that the device
'reads' from. The message is reproduced for the user by
sending the machine a request to start playing at a
particular location.

In some applications, a number of these respone devices
are kept at a central location (with the computer), and
requested messages are sent over telephone lines (separate

---------- response 7
  12/03     20.04     john r       reading

from the data lines) to headphones at the terminal. The
advantage of centralized analog audio is that the number of
audio devices needed can be kept to a small number. The
disadvantages are that (1) too many people wanting too many
different messages at the same time will cause long queuing
delays, (2) separate communications lines are required. Such
centralized analog systems work passably only with limited
numbers of terminals in a limited range of lessons.

PLATO currently uses a distributed analog audio response
system with each terminal having its own device. The
advantages to such a system are that immediacey of response
is never a function of system load, and that the commands to
access the audio can share the same data lines the terminal
uses. The disadvantages are a higher per terminal cost in

the short run, and the need to maintain a disk publishing
and distributing service.
A general advantage of analog response systems is fidelity
of reproduction. Not only speech, but also music, heart
sounds, and special effects can be used for instruction. A
general disadvantage is that no analog systems (that I know
of) have sufficiently rapid random access that sentences can
be built from single words (though they can be built from
phrases). This disadvantage is probably a chimera since
even with rapid access, sentences constructed from words
would lack good intonation patterns.

Digitized Audio Response Devices

'Digitized' audio refers to human speech that began as human
speech and was electronically converted to a form that could
be stored by and in digital devices like computers and disk
packs. The source of a message is the human voice. The
voice is attacked by electronics and stored in an altered
form, usually on a disk pack. It is reproduced by reading
the data from the disk pack, running it through a digital-
to-analog converter, and shipping this converted data to
a speaker or headphones.

Digitized audio is almost always stored at a central site.
In some applications¬ the¬ D¬ to¬ A converters are also centrally
located, adn telephone lines like them to each terminal. In
such applications, the only advantage over centralized
analog audio is that the system can handle more people in 

continued...

---------- response 10
  12/03     20.23     john r       reading

somewhat more lessons with somewhat fewer queuing problems.
I understand that this approach is being used at Pat Suppes'
CAI lab at Stanford, and I'm awaiting a report from that
lab.

The D to A converters can also be distributed to each
terminal. Since the data is digital until it reaches the
converter, it can be sent over the same data lines that the
terminal uses. The disadvantage to this is that while the
audio data is being transmitted, visual data must wait.
Since at its most compact (as far as I know) this data runs
at about 900 bits per second, PLATO terminals (where the
communication scheme handles only 1200 bits/second) would
not be able to handle intermixed audio and visual displays
- a distinct disadvantage. Bolt, Beranek, and Newman are

---------- response 11
  12/03     20.30     john r       reading
currently working on such a system.

An attractive advantage of digitized audio is that no
distribution/production network needs to be maintained
(as must be done with distributed analog systems). Another
is that message response time (on a distributed digitzed
system) can be quite good (not true with a centralized
analog system).

The chief disadvantages of digitized systems are (1) the
very high cost of storage hardware, and (2) the high
bandwidth of the channel from storage device to terminal.
Number 2, especially, has serious implications in the
PLATO environment.

next: synthetic audio

---------- response 12
  12/03     20.39     john r       reading

Synthetic Audio Response Systems

Synthetic audio is speech produced by algorithm rather than
by people. The source of a synthetic audio message is
(in the most sophisticated systems) a written phrase or
sentence. Through programmed consultation of dictionaries,
sentence grammar rules, pronunciation rules, pronunciation
lexicons, inflexion rules, and the like, the computer
produces a string of phoneme and stress codes - and these
are stored until the message is called for. When the = 
message is called for, these codes are sent over data
lines to a decoder which (like our human speech equipment)
turns them into speech.

In such systems, the intermediate code (the phoneme and
stress code string) is centrally stored. The reproducing
equipment is always distributed.

A major advantage of synthetic over digitzed systems is
that synthetic systems will probably require only 300
bits per seond between the computer and the reproducer to
generate speech: in the PLATO environment this means that
the terminal could have coordinated audio/visual displays.

A major disadvantage of synthetic in relation to digitized
or analog audio is that it _is_ synthetic and nobody has any
real experience with the psychological/instructional effects
of such a system on users of various ages. If the only
bad effect is esthetic, synthetic audio will be an important
future tool.

Ah me....

  A similar problem exists with both audio devices and
projector/microfiche systems. The information which is
to be presented cannot be modified by software. On the 
other hand, the charset memory (software modifyable) is
widely used because it is available at no cost/student
beyond that of the base-line terminal/connect cost.
  Once a slide or audio disk is made, enough copies
must be made to support all simultaneous students in the
lesson. The local cost of utilizing PLATO becomes a linear
function of the number of simultaneous students. To 
minimize local cost, the temptation is toward "cafateria"
style CAI which is antagonistic to global concerns.

I notice that the form of the new dataset commands is
very similar to the form of the -transfr- command. I was
wondering if the idea of generalizing the -transfr- command
to include disk accesses had been considered. ie:

transfr d,dloc;c,cloc;len $$ etc.. for datain
* ¬+
transfr n1;d,dloc;len $$ etc.. for dataout
* or
transfr d,dloc0;d,dloc1;len $$ disk to disk

I am aware that anyone of these forms could imply more
than one real disk access (the last one necessitates),
however, these types of accessing occur anyway in most
programs and simply take up more lesson binary, cpu,
and lesson space than a generalized form of the -transfr-
command would. Too many disk accesses could still be
dealt with in the same way that they are presently.
Further, the population explosion of commands could
be cut down.?If it was considered, why was it discarded?

That does look nice (costly perhaps) and neat for some
data manipulations. Of course, you would still have to
worry about zreturn values as in dataset commands but it
certainly seems to have merit. The only draw back I could
see is if it interfered with the normal speed or efficiency
of the present -transfr- command.

        In fact, the whole requirement that disk accesses
begin on record boundaries and be in whole-record
increments could apparently be eliminated.
        If you specify origins of dataset objects as base-¬+-
displacement, the number of 'extra' disk accesses needed to
find your origin on disk would remain the same; all that
would be needed would be a slight extension of the PP
routine that is being written to handle flexible-sized
records.
        Similar considerations apply to length specification
in terms of words.
        Suggested syntax:
transfr d,n1(n5);n12;words,n34
would move (n34) words from the disk location beginning
(n1) words after the start of dataset record number (n5),
spanning record boundaries if necessary.
transfr n1;d,0(1);2 $$ equivalent to dataout 1;n1;2
        A reasonable requirement would be that the
displacement be smaller than the record length.

---------- response 4

   Reserve/release will be a problem if you want to
deal with partial records. No PPU program changes
are needed and the routines are already "flexible."
A smaller minimum record has been considered and is
possible; my own view is that we are encouraging
poor program design and mis-use of the system if we start
allowing disk accesses for only a few words at a time.
 Somehow "hiding" the disk accesses inside of -transfr-
has some interesting aspects, but the fact that
a dataset command would still have to precede any disk
access, the need for the reserve/release mechanism still
"external" to the transfer, etc., together with the fact
that this offers no new capabilities at a time when so
many new things need doing makes any such change extremely

I decided to try and make up a solution to the blank
screen problem before the WELCOME TO PLATO page while
the menorah (I hope it is spelled right) is in use.
This temporarily resides in "logoproc." There is no
inspect code, so you can see my stupid way of doing
it. If it is faster, or even the same speed as loading
the characters at first, and you like the method, tell
your favorite system programmer you would like to see
it in the next version.

Thanks,
Bob Broadus

p.s. Notice that it only uses one character. I thought
     very few lessons use the arrow any more so currently
     that is what I am using. It could be changed to
     any character. This takes care of the ruined charset
     problem too.

Actually, most of that delay is caused by some new (deep-

the next few weeks.

I'll second that. It is an unfortunate coincidence that
the pretty menorah is being blamed for a one-second delay
that is not its fault. We are sending a question to the
terminal, asking what kind of a terminal it is (in
particular, it could be an intelligent terminal of some
kind). We found that as a side effect we are generating
a one-second delay, which we think we can get rid of.
Sorry for the trouble!

---------- response 3
  12/04     20.20     broadus       css

There is a delay on the Press next to begin page,
which occurs whether the characters are loaded
or not. I am speaking of the blank screen delay
while the characters are loading. Also it was
mentioned earlier, that someone was upset that
his character memory was over written. the version
where lab is pressed (in logoproc) only uses
the three 'not linked to plot' slots. In that
the menorah regularly takes up 9 characters
(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i), this would be an improvement.
With keypresses getting lost or worse yet delayed,
it is not to hard to get to the Press next to begin
page. If you are lucky enough to get the menorah,
you will have to load all the charset again, where
as with the method in logoproc, one could hit stop
while loading characters, and still have all the
important ones.

The blank screen is caused exactly by what Bruce was saying.
They now send TWO echos to the terminal which are padded
with delays so the key buffers don't get over written.
That delay was there before the menorah was even added!

  12/05     02.59     broadus       css

I think that we are talking about two different delays.
I am speaking of the one you get when you hit next
on the WELCOME... page( to get to the WELCOME..page)
if you get the menorah, there is a second or two
of blank screen, in that the erase is done before
loading the 9 characters.
I think you are talking of the delay after next is
pressed on the Press next to begin page. I am also
aware that this happens, and I realize that this
is independent of the character loading. I saw some
interesting results of this in FLB the other day.
a young lady was going from one terminal to the next
pressing next (nothing happened so she went on to the
next empty terminal.) So a second after she left each
terminal, the WELCOME... came on, but she was long
gone. I don't know if she ever found a terminal that
she thought was working.

---------- note 207 backspace
  12/04     19.31     b sherwood       s

Would anyone be annoyed if we changed the action of the
backspace (shift-space) to NOT be affected by the left
margin? At present, a backspace from the left margin
moves up one line and over to the right edge of the screen.
This capability seems not very useful, and it causes all
sorts of problems. It seems more reasonable simply to move
left one position, independent of margin. An exception is
the case of a long student answer containing backspaces
for superimposed accent marks, which could be handled as
a special case (but only if the student's answer has in
fact wrapped around one line already -- an initial backspace
by the arrow would just move toward the arrow character).
Comments?

Maybe easiest and most straightforward to not backspace

        3 questions:
1)      Could all the execution errors in the readset
command be eliminated? I am referring to the particular
case that I am presently fighting, of 0 or -0 (";;;;;;;;;;")
It is sort of a pain having to discover/allow for this, and
I'm not sure how many other permutations of the same problem
could be around, undocumented.
        Perhaps at the same time some returns could be added
to readd and company to eliminate the threat of execution
errors in this species of commands, and make the handling?consistent with datasets.?
2)      Is there anyone out there who relies on the afore-
mentioned facts to survive?

3)      Would it be possible, someday, to be able to specify
what type of file you are after during a readset? I mean:

readset datafile;(name),(pass)?

It doesn't help someone who is reading your code. There is

and Dave's proposed format sounds like a good one.

I've been wondering if there has been any progress on
loading arrows with program generated text. I know this
was thrown around a long time ago but I haven't heard
anything lately.

Specifically, what I want to do is show line(s)
of text on the panel and act on them as if they had
just been typed in by the user, so that the edit and erase
keys could be used on them.

Of course, loada or close lets me do just the judging of
such text, but I also need the editing facilities which at
present require some rather strange pause loops or a -press-
COPY1.

One other thing that I really could use is the ability to
assign touch keys to a micro table.

Any possibilities of these things being implemented?

---------- response 1
  12/05     14.06     judy       pso

You want a keypress of "a" (for instance) to be equivalent
to the touching of some point, by defining "a" in the
microtable?

---------- response 2
  12/05     15.42     elston       rhrc

Well, what I would like is a micro table similar to the
standard micro tables with from 10 to 40 characters assigned
to each touch square(this would require 1 to 4 disk blocks).

For instance, if touch square 0 (lower left corner) were
touched with a force micro in effect (or a square associated
with the micro key had just been touched) then the character
string or function key would be entered at the arrow.

It would be helpful if the touch-micro editor could use the
touch panel in generating the key to assign a string.
 A numeric selection would also be necessary and a nice
numeric touch grid on demand would help there.

---------- response 3
  12/05     16.00     elston       rhrc

While I'm at it. Is there any way to get at the strings
stored in the standard micro table in a running lesson
other than at an arrow.

For instance, could there be a command -micro- or -showm-
or some such which would read out or display the contents
of a given micro key. Example:

at     1010
showm  1

would essentially -showa- the contents of the "a" slot in
the micro table.

Or, perhaps, a systems array (i.e., zmicro(xx)) which would
contain the contents of the micro table. This would be
read only, of course.

Any chance?

---------- response 4
  12/08     09.40     judy       pso
If you want to show the "1" position from the standard
micro table, it is infinitely simpler to just say
-showa ¬a-. (-showa "access,a")
How would you use such a feature?

In source code, micros do not work by table look-ups, but
by direct substitution. I.e., when using your own micro-
table to edit and you press MICRO,e and see "elephant",
your source code actually has in it the letters "elephant"
and _not_ "MICRO,e".

Your idea of a -touch- "microtable" is interesting.
To get a touch grid, just press TERM and type in "grid".

---------- response 5
  12/08     10.49     elston       rhrc

I assume you mean -showa '¬a'- with quotes.

As to my intended use of a -showm- (or some such) command,
I wish to use it in the following manner with my own micro
tables (touch keyed or not). Some part of my programs now
show various lists of words and phrases on the panel and
allow the selection by touch of any combination of those
terms. The total combined lists number around 20,000
entries and is growing. At the moment I make use of large
commons and datasets to store these terms and their list
descriptions. The commons take up a great deal of ECS and
the storage needed to store data from datasets is taken up
with other tables.
So if I could store some of the most often used lists in
micro tables and show them on the panel with -showm- I could
save a fair amount of ECS and CPU in these lessons.
I would settle for 2500 words of storage or executable
commons.

---------- response 6
  12/08     11.08     elston       rhrc

As an example of actual use it would be some thing like this
this:

unit  terms
doto  1,i?1,numtrms   $$ number of terms to show
at    start+i?100     $$ position of term(s) on panel
showm trm(strtl+i),20 $$ this would show the (strtl+i)?th??
*                       micro slot (e.g., 'elephantoid')
1

I'll probably find some other way to solve my problems and
the conversion and upkeep of the appropriate micro tables
would be prohibitively time consuming now any way, but I
still would like to see these features _someday_....

The numeric grid I was thinking about would have numbers
from 0-255 (or 0400-0777 or some subset of either of these
sets).

I will attempt to answer some of the questions concerning
telephone disconects. The savings will vary with the user
and as yet I have not obtained a grand total and may not go
to the trouble to obtain same. Only those line which orig-
inate in Urbana and have the other end outside the state of
Illinois(interstate lines) will be effected. Most individ-
ual telephone companys have tariff restrictions, which we
cannot meet, regarding minimun time on temporary disconnect.
        It is true that the possiblity exists for the user
to come back on different facilities than they had original-
ly however in actual practice this is unlikely. The normal
procedure for a disconnect of this short a duration would
be to break the line in Champaign only. The problem will be
that if a line goes down during the interval we wont know
until Jan 10th in order to start repairs.

My negotiations resulted in assurances that any loss of

as I always have to GSA users, that use of these special
billing sevices has a high risk factor over which we have no

are dealing with the federal government, they will never

But the effort spent by the condensor on your lessons
is roughly proportional to the size of the lessons
condensed. In order to get good service, you can help
by condensing only those parts of the lesson which you
are in the process of checking out. There is roughly
a factor of 10 between condensing a 2-block routine and
a 20-block whole lesson, even tho you might execute only
the 2 blocks. Of course, some programs can't be worked
on in little pieces in this way, in which case you will
get slow service compared to people who do not request
so much condensing. Note that the effect is cumulative:
ask for little all day, and during the afternoon you will
get good service. We do hope within the next 6 months to
provide additional condensing power with new computer
equipment.

Often authors may condense several blocks, just to do
the necessary "setup" to test a single unit or iteration.

It will save you condense time, and may save you the
nuisance of working through 14 preliminary questions,
if you will write a little "setup" unit just for testing:

unit setup $$ set necessary parameters
calc length?5 $$ choose arbitrary values
     steps?3
     tryno?8
     increm?.1
     end?14
etc.
jump testit $$ the unit of current interest
*
I can usually get by with 1 block for defines, 1 block
for "setup", plus 1-4 blocks of the real program.

How are the 10 disk accesses allowed in a finish unit

I.e., is there any difference in transferring 10-64 word
records than there would be in transferring 2-320 word
records?

Reason I ask is that it would be more logical for my pur-

The reason for the -copy- command only working with
student variables is that while you are typing at an
arrow, your lesson (and its common) are not loaded
into CM from ECS. Only your student variables are
loaded, saving transfer time.
I don't think this will be changed in the near future.

I suggest that you implement the following:

When a condense request is submitted, read the directory
of the lesson and check space available in each block.
If there were 322 words available in each block (and
whatever is expected in block "a"), then you could
save the wait in the condense queue, as well as the
charge for condense.

Also, it would help if you could check file type on
receiving a condense request. For example, I can now
submit a request to condense an instructor file from
the author mode page. The system tries to condense
it, in spite of the fact that it can't be condensed!

Lesson "easyread" provides a way by which you may store
permanenly any General, Help, or P-note; and then have
an easy way to page through the stored notes!
To save any note, press shift-S while reading the note.
Here is how to use the lesson:

!IS" all notes you want stored in source blocks. The source
blocks should all have the same name. It doesn't really
matter how many notes you put in each block. Convert these
blocks to common (press DATA1 while editing the block).
Then, set up your lesson to "use" easyread (i.e., change
option "f" on the DATA page of the lesson to read
"easyread"). Create another source block in your lesson
and write the following code:

common yourlesson,yourcommon,length $$ length<1500 for now
use notes

Then just condense. Directions are also in block "a" of
the lesson. (cont. in 1st response)

While experimenting with this lesson, I had several problems
editing the 'notefile' I set up, with dissapearing changes
when I converted back and forth from common to source.
Perhaps if there was a command that would allow one to read
into variables whatever was in the Save Buffer of an author
(that it was permissable to use, because it probably exists)
then many lessons could benefit, besides this one and the
parrello/agg char generator. It would seem harmless, right?
And probably be VERY easy to implement....

Insert an option on the data page which would allow the

perhaps the name on the owner line of the data info ..to be
displayed on the 'Sorry-- wrong code' display reached
by trying to edit without inspect or change codes.

In all probability, the additional cpu will not have

not in use. Thus, any problems we have when we come back

  I'm not even sure this is feasible, but here goes...

  I would like to propose a change ot the way variables
are passed. With the present method of passing the value,
several temporary variables are required (which you may
not really be able to afford!). Also, in the common case
where you want the called routine to affect the passed
values, you must either do it yourself, ie

do   change(abc,xyz)
calc abc?I
     xyz?J
where unit change is something like

unit change(I,J)
calc I?I?J?arctan(exp(sin(I)))?? $$ or similar monstrosity
* whatever else you want to do to I and J

--- cont

---------- response 1
  12/08     20.40     fritz       ames

or, alternately, you must perform some unnatural act like

do change(varloc(abc),varloc(xyz))

with unit change altered to

unit change (I,J)
calc n(I)?n(I)?n(J)?arctan etc. etc.??

which still requires some temporary variables.
  My suggestion: could an addition be made to the passing
machinery to allow the IDENTITY of a variable to be passed?
Ie, in the case above, unit change could be called by
a statement like

do change(<abc>,<xyz>), or
do change(¬oabc¬1,¬oxyz¬1), or some such.

-- cont

---------- response 2
  12/08     20.40     fritz       ames

Then, in the -do-ne unit, the "temporary variables" could
be referred to as

unit change(¬0I¬1,¬0J¬1)

where I and J are NOT actual variables, but dummy arguments,
which are treated eXACTLY as if the passed variables were
inserted at each occourance of the dummies (analagous to
a -defined-d function). If it would make it easier, these
"dummies" could be defined along with your other variables,
but with a special identifier instead of a variable.
  Obviously, checks would have to be made on the -do- (or
-jump- or whatever), since this could only apply to
individual variables. (-do-ing unit change with passed
values of, say, 1 and 2 would run into trouble when
it tried to assign a value to "1"!)

  Is something like this at all possible?

---------- response 3
  12/08     21.03     white       p

Yes, it is possible, but would require the system
to hold the dummies, rather than you holding them
in your own variables. This would require N words
per user on the system to allow N dummies, whether
that user was ever going to use a lesson that needed
them or not. Thus, there are some serious drawbacks
to implementing such a feature. Even so, it may
still be done. However, don't expect any decisions
on it for some length of time.

Also, it would be rather difficult to pass them
as in the define command, but it is possible.
It is more likely, however, that addresses would
be passed, similar to your passing varloc(variable).

---------- response 4
  12/08     21.13     fritz       ames

  Um...
I am stupid. Why does the dummy have to be carried by
each user? It seems to me that the most that would be
required would be the identifier for the dummy, which
could be, if nothing else, assigned some pseudo-constant
in the define. No actual variable would be needed anywhere;
it would more or less be a replacement of the identifier
with the variable (although I'm not at all sure something
like this could be implemented into Tutor, since it would
have to be dynamic).

---------- response 5
  12/08     22.01     midden       p

example:
do      f(a,b)
...
unit    f(I,J)
do      g(I,J)
calc    I?I+J
...
unit    g(X,Y)
calc    I?X+Y
*

This should show why one must require reserving each user
with XX many locations for this. After all the size of
each persons student bank is not variable in length! gads
what a mess if it was.
this seems to suggest that either address replace of
arguments or not remembering multiple levels. And also what
if one did just a -goto  g-?

*sigh* and some people say tutor is too simple a language.

---------- response 6
  12/08     22.28     fritz       ames

  Hmmm. I begin to see what you mean. If these things
were called to many levels, you wouldn't be attaching a
variable, you would be attaching a dummy which was attached
to a dummy which was ..... which was attached to a variable.
But... I would think that if the initial concept were
possible, this nesting would be too - IF (which I forgot
to mention before) these dummies were LOCAL to their
unit. Then the problem with -calc I?X+Y- wouldn't
exist, since I simply wouldn't be defined for the
second unit. How full of holes is this idea?
  As for the case with no passed args: I agree -- yuch.
How about setting them to 0 if there is no corresponding
passed argument?

    I have some suggestions for the new SD. It would be nice
if there was some way to skip over all the non-displayable
commands with one key press. As it stands now one has to
wait for a message to plot, press next, and then wait for
the message to erase for each line.

    I have seen the new SD and instead of the problem being
remedied it is worse. The message is longer and thus takes
longer to plot and erase. Also the functions of NEXT and
BACK have been replaced with NEXT1 and NEXT respectively.
Not only is this confusing to old users but it is easy to
accidentally press NEXT when you want NEXT1. Then you have
to go back and start all over.

    Why not leave NEXT and BACK as they were for the non-
displayable line message and use NEXT1 to automaticly skip
all the remaining non-displayable lines.

---------- note 342 double sup
  12/09     18.54     chabay       s

Students typing answers involving superscripts and
subscripts often accidentally hit the SUPER or SUB keys
twice without realizing it. This is an easy mistake to
make, since nothing actually happens when either of these
keys is pressed, but this typing error is difficult for
students to spot.

One possible system-level solution to this problem would be
to ignore all but the first of a series of non-locking
super or subscripts typed at an arrow, It would not change
the handling of locking sup/sub, so it would still be
possible to raise characters by more than one level.

We're interested in reactions to this idea. (Would it
affect current lessons?)

---------- response 1
  12/09     20.12     berger       mfl

I use 2 consecutive SUP's for display purposes: the
displays may be typed in at an arrow in the editor and
it would be disturbing if the SUP key didn't function
logically.

I wouldn't mind it if the answer judger ignored them
(in order to make judging chemical formulae easier
without having to do kludges like:
putd /// $$ sup sup to sup

as we are constantly being advised to do), but it should,
of course, -storea- properly to avoid unpleasant surprises.

---------- response 2
  12/09     20.17     al       mfl

Why doesn't the answer judging (and calculating) machinery

be a bit more logical.

I think we need a bit of clarification here.

Is the proposal to:

        * change the operation of SUPER and SUB so that
          no matter how many unlocking SUPERs and SUBs
          the student types in a row he only goes up five
          dots?

        * alter answer judging so that sequences of
          unlocking SUPERs and SUBs are treated as single
          SUPERs and SUBs?

        * alter the operation of the arrow so that the
          aforementioned sequences of SUPERs and SUBs are
          all compressed into single SUPERs and SUBs before
          judging ever begins?

---------- response 5
  12/10     04.27     b parrello       med

Basically, if this change were made, would it mean that
the (_)==_=c will now displays as (_)_=_=c, or does it simply mean
that it will no longer be possible to type in (_)_=_=c any more
without using locking SUPERs?

---------- response 6
  12/10     08.28     fay       o

I would be much more in favor of including the handling
of your special case, Ruth, in the proposed canonical
judging machinery that I saw proposed sometime ago.

It would make much more sense for the judging machinery to
be able to look at the answer, spot a superficial addition-
al shift code, and be able to decide that, mathemetically
or algebraically, it didn't affect the answer.

My reasoning is that in spite of repeated efforts of in-
structors to educate their students on the nuances of
PLATO's interpretation of key -super- key as opposed to
key -shift-super- key -shift-sub-, many of them never quite
grasp the idea and have to be helped along at otherwise
simple answers.

---------- response 7

I don't anticipate any better success in teaching the

shift super shift super.

---------- response 8
  12/10     11.05     b sherwood       s

But when is it appropriate for the student to type
shift-super shift-super? When do we ask a student to
go up two levels deliberately? With Ruth's suggestion,
two supers in a row would result in the second being
thrown out. Authors or other experienced users could still
get the special effect of going up two levels, simply by
deliberately hitting shift-super twice. Students who
accidentally hit two supers in a row wouldn't get in
trouble. Or are you worried about students deliberately
hitting two shift-supers in a row (in which case canonical
machinery would save the day, but Ruth's wouldn't)?

---------- response 9

You forget that SUPER1 is a 12 bit entity while SUPER is
only 6. This means that there will be an extra 12 bits
to store if you press SUPER1 SUPER1 to get up 10 dots.
Now, if you come up with some proposal for letting us
store 12 characters in a word, rather than 10...

It does seem unreasonable to alter the basic properties
of -storea-, that of accepting any typeable input string
without translation of the input. Why cannot this be done
at the system answer-judging stage instead? It seems a
rather drastic change to make just so lessons utilizing
formula judging can have it a little easier for themselves.

---------- response 12
  12/10     19.33     stan smith       chem

Actually the suggestion goes beyond making it a little
easier. A very large fraction of answers judged -NO- are
the result of multiple -sup- and -sub-. Because multiple
-sup-/-sub- caused so much trouble, PLATO III system
software did ignore the additional inputs. What is being
suggested is that we return to the system which was found
by extensive use over a period of a couple years to work
instead of the current system which has, by similar
experiments, been found not to be satisfactory.

---------- response 13
  12/10     19.43     blomme       s

   Good grief! The change has to do with solving a
REAL problem with student input; the question is whether
anyone anywhere has answers that REQUIRE students to
enter two (or more) consecutive unshifted supers or subs,
not whether a theoretical "flexibility" is being lost.
   The "canonical" form is intended to make equivalent
screen displays have an identical form when the character
string is passed on for judging. Please note that the
appearance on the screen is DIFFERENT if 2 superscripts
are used rather than 1; to keep the meaning and functioning
of "canonical" clean it is not appropriate to make these
strings identical.
   Rather than the current puts or a new specs tag to deal
with this, we want to go to the heart of the problem and
prevent such accidental entries while still permitting the
multiple level 'scripting for those who intend/need it.

---------- response 14
  12/11     09.29     friedman       csa

Seems to me the cleanest fix to the problem is to have
the compiler, or whatever it is that interprets the
_algebraic_ value of an input, simply ignore consecutive
SUPs, SUBs, shifted SUPs, _and_ shifted SUBs, since they
cannot have any algebraic meaning anyway.?
As to their difference in appearance, that is part of the
point! None of these four "characters" should be ignored
for screen display purposes, because two of them DO appear
different than one; they should only be ignored in their
_algebraic_ interpretation. But for true student arrow input
of an algebraic expression, the different appearance is
too subtle to bother the student with.

---------- response 15
  12/11     13.24     judy       pso

Yes, I have lessons which REQUIRE the students to type
two consecutive -sup-s. Since this is done using a
MICRO and -force micro-, it is not a typing problem for
the students.

Yes, I COULD change to use shift-sup-sup in my MICRO table.
BUT...
I am using a 20 character micro, and it happens that
there is space to add the three extra characters which
would be required for the shift-sup-sup scheme. However
for an author using 10-character micro's, the addition
of three more characters to his string is significant, and
might make it impossible to make the preferred MICRO.

If the change required "shift-super-shift-super" rather
than "super-super" or "shift-super-super", that adds 6
characters. I don't believe I could do it.

I don't care how the "sup-sup" is judged. My judging could
be modified to accommodate either scheme.

---------- response 16
  12/11     13.33     judy        pso

In case you are puzzled by the "3 extra characters" of
the previous note:

My current MICRO string is
        SUP SUP a (0676701) which is 3 characters

The proposed scheme would require, since I must return
to my "base line"
        SHIFT SUP SUP a SHIFT SUB which is 6 characters
or
   SHIFT SUP SHIFT SUP a SHIFT SUB SHIFT SUB
        which is 9 characters

If I want a character from the alternate font set, I
would require under the 2nd scheme:
FONT SHIFT SUP SHIFT SUP a SHIFT SUB SHIFT SUB ACCESS FONT
which is 12 characters and forces me to use a
20-character micro.

  12/12     13.12     shirer       s

   Although I can't imagine why I would ever want a student
to type in SUP SUP in a response, I believe that

1) it should still display two supers above line

2) the -calc- machinery should ignore extra SUPs or SUBs
occurrring one after the other

c) the -calc- machinery should not change its handling
of SHIFT-SUP.

Hows that for a SUPer SUBmission?

        Would it be possible to line notes to the editor in
a manner similar to that used for aids? (Possible key to
activate: N). The saving and inserting of saved notes would
be greatly facilitated by being able to move directly from
the source listing page to notes, and after saving a note,
to be able to return to the lesson without having to re-type
the lesson name. The present exit after saving a note would
be fine if the lesson name could be in n1. Pressing NEXT
would then give the block-listing, and SHIFT-NEXT would give
the last edited block.

There is a general feeling that file information is

a bit saying that he is happy for people to look at
the basic file identification info. I might say that
such positive action can also be obtained by the author
writing his sign-on as well as his name on the title

This is one of those areas in which there are conflicts of
goals and interests which make quick decisions difficult.
As a working policy, it has been held in the past that
lessons which are truely ready for wide use should have
current contact information on the student-mode title
display. On other lessons, if the author doesn't want
people to use a lesson yet--it is no one's business who
said lesson belongs to or who should be contacted about it.
Lesson identification will clearly have to be a matter of

To carry the argument further,(and probably beyond the point
of reasonableness), you are not supposed to look at a lesson
unless you have permission from the author! Therefore, in
theory, you don't need to ask who the author is.

This seems to me to be a very peculiar situation. Four times
in this batch of notes, different authors (from different
courses) have requested open access to information about the
author of a lesson. The same request has been made often in
the past. There is virtual unanimity in favor among authors
responding. But systems people say: "No, that information
should be private." No real reasons are given. It's like
when the FDA said: "No, you can't but fish flour...you
wouldn't like it." PLATO is so open in some respects that
this attitude in this case is strange. I say, if an author
doesn't want you to see his lesson, he can dump out anyone
who shouldn't be there. Most authors don't care. Nor, appar-
ently, do most object to their authorship being open. They
should not have to take explicit steps to make it so. I
think open access should be tried.

BRAVO for open lessons! It shouldn't be that lessons
are closed unless approved by the author, but rather
they are open unless the author chooses to close them.
It is for the former reason that data pages should be
accessable so individuals will know who to contact to
get permission to view a lesson. If you close the lesson
and the information as to who you can contact to open the
lesson, then I say scrap the lesson too. There are many
lessons I have viewed that I recommend to others so a
good lesson becomes known, open or not, and individuals
will try to view them. Certainly every author should
have the right to do with his lesson what he wants but
let's take a positive approach rather than a negative one.
The wealth of information on PLATO should be made available
to the many users of the system.

Well now,
    I have added to the pro-open discussion of lessons.

However I have a personal case which occurred about a week
ago, in which I "destroyed" anyone going into my lesson
who did not have my sign-on, and intentionally put as much
security on the lesson as I could..... the reason was
that I was running an experiment and things just could not
be changed between my sessions. I doubt anyone would
have stumbled onto the lesson, or done anything to it if
they had, but I took the precautions. This type of thing
is why I suggest openness in the hands of the authors,
possibly by the process I gave in my response to gn.114.

I still vote for access to author responsible for lesson.

indeed be very nearly impossible and we would have to
do it by fiat--giving a warning a few months in advance
(and maybe finding all lessons with such references and
providing their owners with special notification).
   You will certainly be doing both yourself and the

So, the condense gets longer. The load of the system gets
a little more frustrating.  Yes, that would be were it went,
if/when someone gets convinced that its important enough

Marshall's point was that indeed it would go into syslib,
indeed it would get condensed every time--and obviously
one such feature doesn't take long to condense.  The
problem is that every user (n>>1000) has his own idea of
some neat feature that should be added.  The historical
accumulation of neat features is why it now takes so
long for us to get up after the first "press next to begin".
We really must limit additions to those that are really
needed and useful to a broad class of users.

Maybe this suggestion will be one such.  But we really
don't want to add every feature suggested overnight.

   The comments/suggestions/criticisms regarding lesson

   Indeed, there IS a basic problem hidden amongst those
comments, and that is the problem of finding out what
is available on the system on different topics, the
exact content of apparently relevant lessons, who authored
them, and providing access to such lessons if they
prove appropriate.  Currently such information is spread
amongst sample,  topics, catalog, and authors (and there
is no way simply to "select  a lesson for examination
or for usage by students).  What is needed is a single
lesson that provides access to a large cross-referenced
catalog in much they way that the aids lessons now do
for information on the system and the TUTOR language.

has already gone into the problem. Diverting ANY time
from this major undertaking to fool with access to
lesson data info on lessons which have inspect codes
ins really inappropriate.  Trying to access information
regarding a lesson because somehow you happen to know
that the name used by the system to find it is "abczilch4"
is really primitive and ineffective.  We want access to
be much more open and much simpler for everyone--and we
are sorry that such a facility is not yet available, but

You seem to be directly contradicting what Bruce, Al, and
Bill had to say in responses to GN356. Probably that is
because you are referring to the Catalog for Published
Lessons, while the various user requests have been for ac-
cess to the authors of any and all user lessons whatever.
If that's so, then the two kinds of access are complement-
ary, and somewhat separate issues. Users are simply report-
ing that they keep finding themselves bumping into a gratui-
tous-seeming barrier, and they would like to have the bar-
rier removed. To me, that seems quite a reasonable and
valid request.
        Even if I've misunderstood you, and the Grand
Centralized Solution (effort = 97) will completely displace
the modest decentralized solution (effort = 1.3), it would
not seem appropriate to insist on waiting for the GCS unless
the GCS is going to arrive rather soon.

Please be patient waiting for the "super" programs which
give you all the information about lessons on the system.
We are progressing. "catalog" and "authors" are being
combined with better information retrieval capabilities,
all to be accessed in the student mode as one more step
towards the "ultimate". Dave Fumento has been working on
this program since early summer and it will be available
early in 1976. This is not the same thing as the "catalog
of published lessons" which we are hopeful will be forth-
coming sometime next year too. Meanwhile keep on sending
me "pnotes" for information and I will promptly get it

***NOTICE***

We are trying to optimize the use of the varian copier
in the few remaining days before the scheduled down time
(Dec. 20th). In order to do so, we are asking LARGE users
(¬>30 min. per session) of the varian to please come in to
the operator's office (rm. 166 CERL) and sign up for a
scheduled time. Please come in to sign up only between
8 AM and 5 PM weekdays.

Between now and the 20th, the policy on use of the varian
is as follows: An unscheduled user may use the copier
during a scheduled time (the op on duty can tell you if
someone is scheduled at a particular time), but if the
scheduled user appears, the unscheduled user must vacate
the terminal.
***Continued....LAB***

---------- response 1
  12/11     09.10     fay       o

We discourage users needing only one or two copies from
signing up for a scheduled time. We would appreciate it
very much if such users would merely attempt to take care
of their copying needs early (like the next few days).
Unfortunately, the large users (projects and certain admin-
istrative users within CERL) cannot copy many things
"early" by the very nature of their materials.

We regret this situation and will do our best to attempt to
accommodate all users who need varian copies.

PLEASE: copy early, avoid the last minute rush. There
may not be much we can do for you if you wait until next
Thurs. or Fri. to copy materials you absolutely need before
we go down.

We are planning on having an on-line scheduling system
late in January to avoid future scheduling problems.

        Is there any reason why, when in INSPECT ONLY,
pressing DATA1 will not allow you to enter your security
code if you are in a block? I realize that during editing
DATA1 changes the type of source blocks, but since this

why DATA1 should not be switched to send you to the

I, for one, would prefer to keep the function of DATA1
consistent between the inspect and change mode. Even though
the key is currently disabled while inspecting the contents
of a particular block, giving it a "dual function" at that
point in the editor would be confusing, I think.

Is it that difficult to back out to the directory page to
enter your security code?

Well, it IS damned annoying to go into a lesson, perhaps
with NEXT1 (where you don't see the INSPECT ONLY message),
do some searching to find where you want to change
something, then discover you can't; so you back out of the
block, use DATA1 to enter security code, and lo and behold,
the editor re-initializes itself to display part 1 and to
forget any searching directives you might have typed in.
So you now do your search all over again....?
It would help if the editor did not re-initialize when it
changes from inspect to editing mode.

dunno that they are inspect only... would it be possible
to print ** INSPECT ONLY ** at the right hand field
in the top line of the line display?
*
i realize it is extra overhead and plotting time....
so another possibility would be to have the system wait
until an editing directive is received, then if in
inspect only mode, write ** Sorry, you are only inspecting
** or some such at the top of the screen...

I wrote a similar lesson a couple of months ago:
instructions to "use" lesson "deleted" with your
own common are in lesson "routines", block "deleted".

"deleted" has more display options than "readr", and
I am working on an option to make "terminet" printouts.

Incidentally, there is no inspect code on "deleted"
so you can see that I don't store course codewords.

Silas, I suggest that you do the same, for paranoid 
course directors (and what IS a run code?)

Typing in a dataset name and block limits will allow you
to format multiple course statistics in a dataset for
printing using the

option. Ignoring the dataset name causes "readr" to
simply generate displays for Varian-copying.

     A current feature of the _step_ mechanism doesn't seemoptimal.
     If you do, say, 'step 30,' and somewhere within the
scope of the 30 steps there's a pause, the 'step count'
isn't zerod, so after your keypress the remaining quota of
steps is taken. The same applies to judging commands.
     I would have expected 'step n' to stop after n
steps, or when a keypress is required, whichever comes
first; and would much rather have the extra control this
would provide than save the few keypresses to enter another
'step' directive.

I disagree.
It seems to me that if you had the step-count feature
enabled, it should carry you through the number of steps
you asked for. Disabling the step-count could lead to
frustration if you have the opposite effect...a -pause-
loop which you have to pass through.
Suggested compromise:
How about, when step mode "waits for key" while there
are still more steps to pass, the message gives a little
more information, such as the number of steps since the
count was initiated?

there seems to be a conflict of interests between the

authors objecting to making the data page public have kept
their objections private which makes sense?). It seems
the policy makers keep on wanting to connect the data page
with published lessons and the authors want to connect the
data page with easier communication with authors and student
i feel easier communication among authors is really importan
and shouldnt be held back by published lessons. there are
stages of developement between the writing of a lesson and
the finished(published) product. During this time easy 
communication is rather useful. i am rather surprised there
isnt a lesson where authors can announce their lesson as

The system staff are very concerned about easy

Nevertheless, although it is currently easy to use lessons
without an author's permission, you should not assume that
you have any _right_ to do so. Part of Golden's point is
that implementing what you request could imply to future
users and future courts that privacy and ownership are not
inherent features of PLATO authoring.

As for authors speaking up, I'm the head of a group of
people who have developed 1600 lessons spaces
full of material. When we put inspect codes on lessons,
it's because we want them private. I vote against your
idea.

Despite the impracticality which you describe, the lessons
I am working on are like the papers on my desk-- you have
no right to look at them even if an opportunity presents
itself unless and until I either publish in some sense or
invite you to inspect them.

Even a lesson without inspect code should not be entered!
You wouldn't think it right to enter my home uninvited just 
because you found the door unlocked.

i think have been misread here. there is a BIG difference
between looking at a lesson as a student and using or look
ing at the lesson as an author. I dont think i would like 
people using some of my code either. but i would like to
make sure that as many people as possible know my lesson 
exists so i can get feedback on it and i would like them 
to know how to get a hold of me as easily as possible with
a mininum amount of hassel. Basically what good is a product
if no one knows about it and has trouble finding out who
wrote it. who knows they might even want to have that author
write some lessons for them. Seems to me that easy access
to certian very specific types of imformation is important.
ie a lesson of a certain type exist and the name of who wrotee
it. by the way how many of you have explicity asked
permission of an author to run his lesson and have done it
for every new lesson you encountered.

The question is NOT what is convenient nor is it how YOU
would treat YOUR lessons. The question is what policies
afford each author the greatest authority over access to
his materials. With the current scheme, one can allow
exactly as much access (for authors and students) as one
wishes by advertising through notes or pnotes.
With the schemes you propose, your own very lax
standards become the default, and nothing more secure is
possible.

By the way, I assume this whole discussion began because
you couldn't find out who wrote a lesson. Has it yet
occurred to you that that author may not want to be
bothered by you?

I would like to say that I have never had problems or en-
countered major delays in getting the author's name and
course from tebby/pso, or in getting responses from the
author. The only time I was not able to get permission
from an author in time to use his lesson in a demo occurred
when I myself did not make the request soon enough. I am in
favor of access to lessons when it is reasonable, and I
would note that fils such as PAD and others are often used
to announce new lessons. If, however, I have a lesson which
is not ready to be demo'd, or do not want demo'd for some
reason, why should someone else expect that he has a RIGHT
to demo, inspect, run in student mode, or otherwise inter-
fere with my work ?

The analogy between a PLATO lesson and papers on a desk is
a bit stretched. If lessons are really considered by the
system in that light, why not enforce the "no browsing"
rule by creating a new codeword on the lesson data page
which must be blank for students to run or matched by an
author to be requested from the AUTHOR MODE page?

Instead...

'Twould seem simplicity itself to take a prior suggestion:

Let the author specify whether the data page will be open to 
anyone, perhaps by toggling a bit via DATA from the lesson
data page itself. The default would be as it now stands,
no access. If this is a programming problem, say so; if
it's a policy matter, somehow I just don't see it.....

Personally, I don't like to include my signon on the title 
page of a lesson; it is not my name, but a PNOTE to "Gary
Michael" will be rejected.

      It seems to me that a little common sense and
courtesy is all that's required here. There is no need to
obtain the permission of a author to use an announced les-
son, as far as I can see. It is quite another matter to
discover a lesson by typing random characters at the AUTHOR
MODE arrow. and execute it. I know that, in the lesson I
am currently developing, a person executing without my per-
mission could change stored information that would make my
debugging efforts much more difficult. Therefore, I think
the system policy should stress that you do not use unan-
nounced lessons without obtaining the permission of the 
author. As for the DATA page, I can see no reasonable ob-
jection to implementing the suggested feature--an author
selectable display to be given to people who want to get in
touch with the author. After all, thing would be easier for
tebby.

I don't understand the heat that this discussion always
brings out!?
Personally, I agree with what Gray Michael said a couple
of replies back.?
This discussion brings out different explanations for the
present situation from different system people. Golden
makes it a privacy policy matter; Blomme makes it a 
practical matter of how to allocate system programmers'
time. Both are presumably true. Both are subject to
discussion. Something like Michael proposes would seem
to me to meet Golden's objections, and I doubt it could
require an awful lot of system staff time to implement.

Gray Michael's suggestion is a good one.

It is sometimes undesirable to have title pages
with author information. Most students would be confused
with the message: "contact siegel/peer...."
Many lessons are not of the "stand alone" variety (as is
a lesson for a university course) and therefore, a title
page is often not wanted.
****
If I am debugging a lesson and want to keep other people
out I simply -jumpout q- other people.
I use similar code to keep people from certain courses out.
****
The above holds for when you know the name of a lesson.
Having a general catalog to search for lessons of interest
is a complicated problem. But Michael's idea is a nice
interim solution.

signon-restricting a developemental lesson while it's in
the developement stage??? I do that with all my just-

   I really fail to see the analogy about walking into
someones house if the door is unlocked. Insurance companies
sure take a dim view of that attitude and so would, I would
bet, a legal copyright hearing. The point is not one of
idealism, but rather one of bare fact. There are several
provisions for excluding people from your lessons and they
are readily available to ALL authors. Should an author not
take the steps necessary to do this then he has essentially
agreed to let anyone run his lesson as a student. I cannot
believe that anyone can seriously believe that an idealistic
point of view is sufficient to solve this problem. You can
not quote points of ethics, morality, etc to the world and
hope for results. You must deal with hard facts and the
fact is that without an inspect code it is open to the
public.

In the past, I had believed that if a lesson could be
condensed, it was permissible for an author to take a
look at what he could. I get the impression from the last
note that this is not so.
This surprises me. If an author really wants to lock other
people out of his lesson, all he needs are an inspect code,
a pause, a term, and a press stop1. It will work quite
effectively.
Really if I am trying to explore the capabilities of the
system, must I send every author of every lesson that I
would like to access (just so I can see what it does) a
p-note asking permission?

I believe, that if an author does not want other authors
looking at his lesson, he is responsible for protecting it
(via inspect code, terms, etc.). Should he not protect it
in these ways, any undesired author use of the lesson is
a result of his negligence in not protecting it. And
invitation to enter, failing to protect a bicycle at SIU
by locking it will result in confiscation--by the police.
Analogies are interesting but not always applicable.

Just can't accept the moral code you present. Locks are

I hate to belabor the point, but in your last note you just

a lesson, and then just turned around and asked me if I
remember all the times I was invited to use it.

In high school, we all used everyone else's programs without
asking. If the author wanted to keep other people out, he
could then protect his lesson from other's useage.

The DEC-10 has an even better system. Each file has a
protect code associated with it allowing control over what
other's may do to the file.

On either system, a file is there for everone's use unless
otherwise stated.

I agree with alan and others that one should be able

the ideologies of PLATO (my interperatation) this is
the way it should be. Attributes are changable, so
if you do not want your lesson in the public domain,
than insert the simple code.

But this whole argument started over the fact that we
CAN'T ask the author for permission to use his/her lesson
because it is the SYSTEM'S policy that you shouldn't use
a lesson until you ask the author and that you shouldn't
be able to find out the author except by executing the
lesson and reading it on the title page. Still no one has
come up with an argument as to why we shouldn't be able
to inspect the data page to find WHO TO ASK!

By the way, notes is almost full.
