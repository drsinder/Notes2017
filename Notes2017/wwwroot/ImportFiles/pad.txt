Kids are never the problem.  They are born scientists.  The problem is
*always* the adults.  They beat the curiosity out of kids.  They out-number
kids.  They vote.  They wield resources.  That's why my public focus is
primarily adults.

[A]dults are not all they're cracked up to be.  And most of them are wrong
most of the time.  This can be quite revelatory for a kid - often launching
them on a personal quest of exploration, rather than of Q&A sessions with
their parents.

The art of teaching consists in large part of interesting people in things
that ought to interest them, but do not.  The task of educators is to
discover what an education is and then to invent the methods of interesting
their students in it.

First 7 days of Uber driving:
 
105 trips
Driver rating 4.83/5
679 miles driven
$857 in fares
$644 uber payout
-$390 IRS allowable mileage deduction
-$35  gas
=
$219 net
or
$31 / day - just about enough to pay for my eating out twice a day.
I'd just stay home and cook but I don't enjoy that as much.
 
The IRS business deduction of $0.575/mile over 100,000 miles is $57,500.
100,000 miles of gas for my Camry Hybrid is about 2,500 gallons @ let's say
a generous $4.00/gallon = $10,000.  That leaves over $47,000 to buy a new
car every 100,000 miles or at the rate I drove this week, once every 147
weeks or about every 3 years.
 
Shortest trip:  0.39 miles
Longest trip:  20.1  miles (Rantoul DMV)
 
I'm paying about $300 a year extra for business insurance on the car rather
than personal use.  Plus another $180 per year in extra umberella liability
insurance ($1M).  That's about $500 a year in extra insurance (although I
probably should have the $1M extra liability anyway.)  So maybe only a
$45,000 new car in 3 years.  Or bank the extra and keep driving my current
car.

Uber has a no tip policy.  No way to do it in the app.  If the client
insists they can give you cash.

For comparison, in CU, taxi fares are:  $2.75 to sit down and $2.50/mile
That would be ~$1900 vs the $857 Uber charged.
 
How many hours of "work" is that Dale?  105 fares a week is ~15/day.  If
each trip (getting the fare, the ride, collecting fare) average 30m, then
those are full days for not much pay.  I know pay isn't the goal.  I'm
trying to get a feel for how uber treats their drivers.
 
Lets assume the car goes 300k before you replace it. (9 years)
150k income (using your post gas expense number)
-30k for new car
-800 for oil changes ($40 every 15k with synthetic oil)
-2k for tires (~$500/set every 75k miles for the OEM tires)
-?/year in maintenance 
 
Okay, this isn't adding up as fast as I had feared.  It comes out
to ~13k/year.  That isn't much, even in CU.  Around here, that won't
pay your share of the rent.

I'd have to say Uber does not treat its drivers well.  And no, it is
nowhere near a living "wage".  My own motivation was that I was getting a
bit bored and I really enjoy driving.  I view it a bit like entertainment
that costs nothing.  A bit more than a hobby.
 
Uber has a history of increasing their cut from 20% to 25% after a while
in a new area and also of cutting rates.  If they do that here I'll be
quitting.

move elsewhere.)

I still have my 1999 Saturn SC-2 (366K miles and counting), but today I
picked up an impractical but fun toy, a 2015 Scion FR-S.
 
http://www.scion.com/cars/FR-S2015/colors/
 
This is the first car I've bought new since about 1986, before I got
married.  I got my car in a color they call Halo which is White.  Automatic
transmissions have come a long way in the past couple of decades, but I
opted for the 6-speed manual.  Fuel efficiency isn't great, but isn't
terrible either; I'm hoping for about 30 mpg combined.  I'll know more
after a couple of tanks of gas.
 
It's a small, 2-door coupe, with front engine, rear-wheel drive, and a low
center of gravity.  There's not a ton of power, but the handling is first
rate.  And it's a generation ahead of the Saturn both under the hood and in
the electronics.

Rear wheel drive, eh?  Be interested to see what you think of that come
next winter.  10 to 1 it doesn't last as long as the Saturn.  
 
On the bright side, you can get it with a manual, other than "sports
cars" difficult to find that these days.

I believe the preservation of our civil liberties to be the most
fundamental and important of all our governmental problems, because it
always has been with us and always will be with us and if we ever permit
those liberties to be destroyed, there will be nothing left in our system
worthy of preservation.

For the first time ever I was watching a DVD today and it let me chapter
advance past the FBI warning.  I nearly fainted.  Actually, I didn't
believe it.  I had to stop, eject and reload the DVD and do it again to
verify it actually happened.
 
Glory Hallelujah!

I'd bet on the DVD having a "manufacturing defect."
 
Most computer DVD players don't recognize (honor) the no skip signal, so if
it really annoys you, use a computer instead of a dedicated DVD player.

Sometimes you can hold the FastForward button through those annoying
initial screens, even if the NextChapter button isn't allowed (or if
pushing Menu or Title doesn't get you to the right place).
 
Some of those previews and other forced nonsense is going to be really
stupid if I'm still alive twenty years from now and wanting to watch
one of these DVDs.
 
Coming soon!!  In the spring of 2003!!!  You GOTTA see this; yet another
collection of scenes of people fighting each other, breaking furniture,
maybe even shooting at each other from speeding cars!!!     *YAWN*
Yah, I'm really looking forward to popping that DVD in my player in 2026

Look around you.  Everywhere.  They are there.  In every home -- lurking in

their games in which adults are the pawns.  They play and wait for the time
when they will take over the world!

Wow.  Michael Slager / Walter Scott shooting.
 
I want to believe a case like this is the rarity.  However, if the story I
heard about Slager reporting he didn't fire "until he thought his life was
in danger" is correct -- it really has to make you wonder.  How many people
got killed by cops in ways not consistent with the report of the officer?

"Passive resistance," said Ferdinand Lassalle, with an obtuseness
thoroughly German, "is the resistance which does not resist." Never was
there a greater mistake.  It is the only resistance which in these days of
military discipline resists with any result.  There is not a tyrant in the
civilized world today who would not do anything in his power to precipitate
a bloody revolution rather than see himself confronted by any large
fraction of his subjects determined not to obey.  An insurrection is easily
quelled; but no army is willing or able to train its guns on inoffensive
people who do not even gather in the streets but stay at home and stand
back on their rights.  Neither the ballot nor the bayonet is to play any
great part in the coming struggle; passive resistance is the instrument by
which the revolutionary force is destined to secure in the last great
conflict the people's rights forever.

Representation gets a bad rap.  Its inadequacy is inbuilt; it's doomed to
fail us; the thing it strives to capture and communicate endlessly eludes
it.  But it's what we have, so we use our crude visual and verbal tools to
circumscribe, gibber, and gesture.  Drooling a bit, we imagine a method of
communication that would translate its subject perfectly and entirely.
Prior to the age of #nofilter, photography was believed to contain this
possibility.  Sometimes the medium -- particularly the documentary genre --
still pretends.

In today's society a good many people seem to have the idea that if one is
born without talent, there is nothing he can do about it; they simply
resign themselves to what they consider their "fate".  Consequently they go
through life without living it to the fullest or ever knowing life's true
joy.  That is man's greatest tragedy.

I've gone a couple of hundred thousand miles since my last flat tire.  I
don't know whether they're just made that much better now than they were
when I was younger, or if I just do that much better a job of replacing my
tires before they get too ratty.

Contrary to what the politicians and religious leaders would like us to
believe, the world won't be made safer by creating barriers between people.
Cries of "They're evil, let's get 'em" or "The infidels must die" sound
frightening, but they're desperately empty of argument and understanding.
They're the rallying cries of prejudice, the call to arms of those who find
it easier to hate than admit they might be not be [sic] right about
everything.  Armageddon is not around the corner.  This is only what the
people of violence want us to believe.  The complexity and diversity of the
world is the hope for the future.

Our economy is and has always been subject to fluctuations, sometimes very
extreme fluctuations.  The law was clear that the promised benefits would
therefore have to be paid and that the responsibility for providing the
state's share of the necessary funding fell squarely on the legislature's
shoulders.
 
The General Assembly may find itself in crisis, but it is a crisis which
other public pension systems managed to avoid and ... it is a crisis for
which the General Assembly itself is largely responsible.
 
It is our obligation, however, just as it is theirs, to ensure that the law
is followed.  That is true at all times.  It is especially important in
times of crisis when, as this case demonstrates, even clear principles and
long-standing precedent are threatened.  Crisis is not an excuse to abandon
the rule of law.  It is a summons to defend it.

The pensions are not the problem. The deliberate and irresponsible decision
to refuse to fund them as required is the problem. I can still remember the
state having to switch vehicle fuel providers on a regular basis due to
not paying the bill and getting cut off.

Nah, I think some of those pensions are out of line with what is seen in
other states. Pensions need to be capped to something like the lower of
$70k a year or 70% of your income.
 
Also, I'd argue pensions need to go away entirely and replaced with 401k
plans.

* The average monthly retirement benefit of a SURS annuitant is $3,182.64
    [$38,191.68 annually] (as of March 23, 2015).
 
* 53% of benefit recipients receive $2,600 [$31,200 annually] or less per
    month (as of March 23, 2015).
 
Most of the reforms you seek have been in effect since 1/1/2011 when
new-hires began entering Tier II (capped max pension, more required years,
higher retirement age, smaller COLAs not compounded).  I'm sure we'll make
the switch to defined-contribution, but that switch will be hard to fund,
since pension payouts are largely paid for by current wage-earners.
 
I'd be happy if pension income was no longer exempted from state income
tax.  I'd be happy with a cap on pension income.  I'be happy with the
public flogging of people who gamed the system by working for as little as
a day just to get their foot in the pension door.  And while you're at it,
the public flogging of the legislators and governors who diverted the
state's pension payments for the last 100 years.  But the average annuitant
in the bullet points above, who paid 8% of every check into SURS and is
ineligible for Social Security, is a weak excuse for a villain.

be a citizen is to learn that some ideas, some words, some images can be
shocking.  Being shocked is a part of democratic debate.  Being shot is
not.

My view is this: We teach nothing.  We do not teach physics nor do we teach
students.  (I take physics merely as an example.) What is the same thing:
No one is taught anything! Here lies the folly of this business.  We try to
teach somebody nothing.  This is a sorry endeavour for no one can be taught
a thing.  What we do, if we are successful, is to stir interest in the
matter at hand, awaken enthusiasm for it, arouse a curiosity, kindle a
feeling, fire up the imagination.  To my own teachers who handled me in
this way, I owe a great and lasting debt.

Seems like he's telling us that the teacher awakens in the student an
interest in the topic, and only then does the student learn (through her
own curiosity).  You're right that one avenue of information for the
inspired student is the teacher himself.

I guess there're 4 Horsemen. Mark Webb has been an important cog in the
machinery for about 15 years. As for me, I've already emigrated to Indiana.
 
I'll be sticking with Pearson as well. The benefits are pretty decent, and
if/when they lay people off, it normally comes with 2 weeks of pay/year of
service.
 
I can't get away with Ray's plan to retire because he has a few years on me
in age, and I have a wife and a few kids on him to support. So I'll be
sticking around with Pearson working out of my house for the foreseeable
future.
 
I'm pretty sure that's John and Mark's plan as well.
 
 
11 moves in 20 years. Wow. I knew you've moved about a few times, but not
that many. Is that 3 states?  How many cities/towns is that?
 
I've moved 3 times in the last 20 years, with 17 years in the house I moved
out of last year.  This new house still doesn't feel like home. (I wonder
how long it'll take for that to happen.)

When you get in situations where you cannot afford to make a mistake, it's
very hard to do the right thing.  So if you're trying to do the right
thing, the right thing might be to eliminate the cost of making a mistake
rather than try to guess what's right.

It's not that every intelligence agency is evil.  It's not that they never
do any good at all.  We want to have some level of intelligence-gathering.
We want to be able to investigate criminals; we want to be able to respond
to military threats.  But that's a very far cry from watching everyone in
society without regard to their guilt or innocence -- to the mass
surveillance of entire populations rather than individual people.

dumping the puck into the zone.  They still do dump the puck in, but the

"Kindness" covers all of my political beliefs.  No need to spell them out.
I believe that if, at the end, according to our abilities, we have done
something to make others a little happier, and something to make ourselves
a little happier, that is about the best we can do.  To make others less
happy is a crime.  To make ourselves unhappy is where all crime starts.  We
must try to contribute joy to the world.  That is true no matter what our
problems, our health, our circumstances.  We must try.  I didn't always
know this and am happy I lived long enough to find it out.

I must admit I was appalled to hear of Treasury Secretary Jack Lew's
decision last week to demote Alexander Hamilton from his featured position
on the ten dollar bill. ...  Hamilton, the first Secretary of the Treasury,
would qualify as among the greatest of our founders for his contributions
to achieving American independence and creating the Constitution alone.  In
addition to those accomplishments, however, Hamilton was without doubt the
best and most foresighted economic policymaker in U.S. history.

In a democracy, the power to make the law rests with those chosen by the
people.  Our role is more confined -- "to say what the law is." Marbury v.
Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803).  That is easier in some cases than in
others.  But in every case we must respect the role of the Legislature, and
take care not to undo what it has done.  A fair reading of legislation
demands a fair understanding of the legislative plan.  
 
Congress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance
markets, not to destroy them.  If at all possible, we must interpret the
Act in a way that is consistent with the former, and avoids the latter.
Section 36B can fairly be read consistent with what we see as Congress's
plan, and that is the reading we adopt.  
 
The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
is Affirmed.

I'm happy with the outcome, but I can see some validity in the opposing
case.  I felt that the 4 magic words, "established by the state", clearly
were intended to have the meaning attributed to them by the court.  But the
phrasing is inconsistent with other parts of the bill that have clearer
references to the markets.  And those four words, on plain reading, seem to
have a meaning that is *not* the meaning attributed to them by the court.  
 
In the case of a functioning, 3-branch government, the law should have been
tossed back to Congress for them to fix.  In the world we live in, the
justices chose to preserve the status quo rather than strike it down and
trust Congress to legislate a fix.

No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals
of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family.  In forming a marital
union, two people become something greater than once they were.  As some of
the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that
may endure even past death.  It would misunderstand these men and women to
say they disrespect the idea of marriage.  Their plea is that they do
respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for
themselves.  Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness,
excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions.  They ask for
equal dignity in the eyes of the law.  The Constitution grants them that
right.

radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels

Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient
causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more
disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by
abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.  But when a long train
of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces a
design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is
their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for
their future security.

I love this business of having an outboard brain.  Just as having a
calculator liberates you from being a shitty human spreadsheet and allows
you to do real math, having the Internet liberates you from being a shitty
human encyclopedia and allows you to do real synthetic thought.  Every
interesting thing that crosses my transom, and there's a seemingly infinite
number of them, I turn into a post that explains to strangers why it's
interesting.  This is powerfully mnemonic, it joins a kind of super dense
cloud of fragmentary ideas that kind of knock around in my subconscious and
eventually two of them glom together and nucleate and turn into novels, or
speeches, or essays.  It's wonderful to not have to bother yourself with
the minutiae and be able to look at bigger, more synthetic questions

We have to reflect on what these issues mean, and when we have a
controversial case -- and a very difficult case like (same-sex marriage) --
we draw down on a capital of trust, a deposit of trust.  We spend that
capital of trust, and we have to rebuild that capital.  We have to put new
deposits, new substance into this reservoir of trust.

A single ray of light from a distant star falling upon the eye of a tyrant
in bygone times may have altered the course of his life, may have changed
the destiny of nations, may have transformed the surface of the globe, so
intricate, so inconceivably complex are the processes in Nature.  In no way
can we get such an overwhelming idea of the grandeur of Nature than when we
consider, that in accordance with the law of the conservation of energy,
throughout the Infinite, the forces are in a perfect balance, and hence the
energy of a single thought may determine the motion of a universe.

There are two kinds of truth: the truth that lights the way and the truth
that warms the heart.  The first of these is science, and the second is
art.  Neither is independent of the other or more important than the other.
Without art science would be as useless as a pair of high forceps in the
hands of a plumber.  Without science art would become a crude mess of
folklore and emotional quackery.  The truth of art keeps science from
becoming inhuman, and the truth of science keeps art from becoming
ridiculous.

This is one of the few truths where my reaction is BS.
 
There was great art before there was any science.
A society could have great science before discovering art.
Both may be better than either alone.  Neither seems to require the other.

It is a strong argument for democracy that governments regulated by
principles of accountability, respect for public opinion and the supremacy
of just laws are more likely than an all-powerful ruler or ruling class,
uninhibited by the need to honour the will of the people, to observe the
traditional duties of Buddhist kingship.  Traditional values serve both to
justify and to decipher popular expectations of democratic government.

Every day, in every community in America, scouting is changing lives --
teaching young people skills and leadership, and helping them build
character and integrity.  As I said during our national annual meeting in
May, due to the social, political, and legal changes taking place in our
country and in our movement, I did not believe the adult leadership policy
could be sustained. ...
 
The best way to allow the BSA to continue to focus on its mission and
preserve its core values was to address the issue and set our own course.
And that's what we've done.
 
For far too long this issue has divided and distracted us.  Now it's time
to unite behind our shared belief in the extraordinary power of scouting to
be a force for good in a community and in the lives of its youth members.

Here is a link to David Wolley's review -- highly recommended:
http://just.thinkofit.com/the-righteous-mind/
 
From Amazon:
 
As America descends deeper into polarization and paralysis, social
psychologist Jonathan Haidt has done the seemingly impossible--challenged
conventional thinking about morality, politics, and religion in a way that
speaks to everyone on the political spectrum. Drawing on his twenty five
years of groundbreaking research on moral psychology, he shows how moral
judgments arise not from reason but from gut feelings. He shows why
liberals, conservatives, and libertarians have such different intuitions
about right and wrong, and he shows why each side is actually right about
many of its central concerns. In this subtle yet accessible book, Haidt
gives you the key to understanding the miracle of human cooperation, as
well as the curse of our eternal divisions and conflicts. If you're ready
to trade in anger for understanding, read The Righteous Mind.

"Moral systems are interlocking sets of values, virtues, norms, practices,
identities, institutions, technologies, and evolved psychological
mechanisms that work together to suppress or regulate self-interest and
make cooperative societies possible."
 
This is a functionalist definition. I define morality by what it does,
rather than by specifying what content counts as moral.

I've been lurking here for awhile, and have my usual signon over on cyber1
(getting uncomfortably close to the 1K-hour mark over there).  Most of my
time there lately has been in crypt -- never got into avatar and don't want
to think about how quickly I'd die in empire.
 
Email is don@piven.net, or don@haveapineapple.com (yes, that works).
 
I'd lost track of how to connect here, and was rather surprised to find
that this signon was still active and I actually remembered the password
for it.

I've been lurking here for awhile, and have my usual signon over on cyber1
(getting uncomfortably close to the 1K-hour mark over there).  Most of my
time there lately has been in crypt -- never got into avatar and don't want
to think about how quickly I'd die in empire.
 
Email is don@piven.net, or don@haveapineapple.com (yes, that works).
 
I'd lost track of how to connect here, and was rather surprised to find
that this signon was still active and I actually remembered the password
for it.
 
It felt pretty damn good to sequence here and see signons (and their
associated writing styles) I have warm memories of.

I first saw a PLATO system in about 1972 when my 2 oldest brothers were
students at the UI, and my family still lived in southern Illinois.  I
think it was at FLB, and they showed me the chess program, "chess4p2".
Fascinating stuff.
 
The family moved to Urbana in 1973 as I entered high school.  My closest
friends were Dan LaBerge (some of you may know him) and Chuck Engels,
fellow students at UHS.  We got access to the system in various ways for
gaming purposes, but that was about it.  
 
In March 1975 our high school chemistry teacher, Mrs. Conrad, pulled a
string or two with Don Bitzer and sent us to see him.  Don talked to us for
a bit, then asked Bill Golden to create "cerl" records for all 3 of us, and
to give us lesson space where we could teach ourselves to code.
 
We mostly goofed around, but learned a little by osmosis over time.  By the
time I graduated from high school and needed a job, I found that I could
get paid for working on PLATO, and that was a big step up from fast food.
 
I worked as an operator, junior system staff (thanks Bob & Bruce!), "edpsy"
at the Childrens Research Center, "chambana" for CDC, a little Duosoft, and
got my break taking over for Ken Burkhardt when he left his gig at Chanute
AFB in Rantoul.  I worked there a little over 2 years in my first salaried
job.  I also served for a considerable time with the spin-offs at Regency
Systems and TenCORE.  After a stint freelancing in the San Diego area, I
ultimately landed at NovaNET in 1994, and stuck around for just over 8
years.
 
I've been programming ever since high school, one of the ancient breed of
self-taught programmers (though I owe much to the patient hand-holding of
Elaine Avner in TERM-consult, and my cohorts such as Bill Galcher and Paul
Resch and John Matheny in my student staff days).  I can't imagine how
differently things would have turned out without PLATO / NovaNET in my
life.

When the world ends, I may not even be around to see it.  I'll be on
another continent for most of the rest of August.
 
Three years ago, my youngest, Alyssa (then 14) took up tumbling in
Monticello.  On about the second night, she was doing a round off and put
her hand down wrong, twisting her arm, and breaking her elbow in two
places.  Not as major as it sounds, but it took her out of tumbling.
 
When she recovered and wanted to resume tumbling, I offered to instead let
her try Tae Kwon Do at HMD Academy in Monticello, where they teach
non-competitive TKD as an art.  After a couple of weeks of watching class I
was invited to particpate, and then we were given an offer I couldn't
refuse -- going 2 for 1.  That is, I could attend class for free as long as
my daughter was enrolled, which I did.
 
After about a year and a half Master Hyong asked me if I'd like to join his
instructor program, and I did.  This fall I'm wrapping up the instructor
program.  I've been a black belt candidate since May, and will test for 1st
Dan either this fall or next spring.  I started assistant teaching in
February and started holding classes on my own in Monticello in June.  TKD
has become a big part of what I do.  It's a good all-round exercise for
geezers like me who need all the strength and balance conditioning we can
get.
 
In addition to being a 7th Dan and one of the heads of the Moo Do
Federation, Master Hyong is a member of the World Martial Arts Union
(WoMAU), and is responsible for bringing the US contingent to the World
Martial Arts Festival in Chungju City, which this year is Saturday 22
August through Sunday 30 August.  My daughter Alyssa and I will both be
going, leaving early Thursday morning (a 13 hour flight that crosses 14
time zones -- 27 clock hours to get there, but -1 clock hours to return).
 
If NovaNET is up when I return, and I can keep my eyes open, I'll be
on-line that Sunday.  I won't have Internet while I'm travelling, so
"trvth" will be silent for 10 days.

And now, the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend, I'll say it clear
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
 
I've lived a life that's full
I've traveled each and every highway
But more, much more than this
I did it my way
 
Regrets, I've had a few
But then again, too few to mention
I did what I had to do
And saw it through without exemption
 
I planned each charted course
Each careful step along the byway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way
 
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all, when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out
I faced it all and I stood tall
And did it my way
 
I've loved, I've laughed and cried
I've had my fill my share of losing
And now, as tears subside
I find it all so amusing
 
To think I did all that
And may I say - not in a shy way
Oh no, oh no, not me
I did it my way
 
For what is a man, what has he got
If not himself, then he has naught
To say the things he truly feels
And not the words of one who kneels
The record shows I took the blows
And did it my way
 
Yes, it was my way

Oh, the world is round always remember
When it seems you've reached the end
It might just be you've found the beginning
Something better than what has been.
 
Once upon a time I was in your shoes
PLATO had let me down
I thought I was standin' at the end of the world
But I learned that the world is round.
 
All the world is round always remember
When it seems you've reached the end
It might just be you've found the beginning
Something better than what has been.
 
--- Instrumental ---
 
Yes, I know how you feel I know how you hurt
Your teardrops are tapping the ground
You think that you're standing at the end of the world
But you learn that the world is round.
 
All the world is round always remember
When it seems you've reached the end
It might just be you've found the beginning
Something better than what has been.

I feel like such a rookie amongst you all.  My first experiences with PLATO
were in 1984 as a grad student in the College of Education here. I learned
meaningless to me Latin prefixes (thank you Prof. Scanlan) and managed to
get fired from a teaching position in =tenure while in the basement of the
Education building. I also did manage to get tenure when I tried it again.
I knew it could be extremely cool but I was teaching in Rantoul so I did
not get to see it again,
 
Flash to January, 1991 when I was hired to work in PSO for CERL. Since
then, it has been a most interesting chance to watch it evolve, move to
downtown Champaign before it was cool to be there, and now watch it be
allowed to fade away like a good soldier.  I use what I learned working on
it when I work on the U of I campus supporting Blackboard Learn 9.1 on a
daily basis from designing educational materials to handling professors who
do not need training to remaining relatively calm when the damn system
starts to break.
 
Most importantly, I enjoyed reading =pad with your wit, wisdom,
insight, and insanity. There have been some really smart people writing in
here over the years.
 
Thank you!

There's something both annoying and unsurprising at the same time, that
the author mode's banner message regarding the 8/31 shutdown says to 
go to a tinyurl web link and not a notesfile note on the system.  AND,
when you do manage to carefully read and type into a browser the tinyurl

The key to reasoning with insurance companies:
 
1) Know the rules (look them up).
 
2) Fax them the laws with the relevant sections highlighted.
 
3) Know the key phrases.
My agent gave me a list. Then tell the insurance company, either follow
the rules, or the state insurance commisioner gets a letter with these
key phrases that require them to audit the case."
 
Suddenly things get resolved very quickly.

I've been following things over on cyber1 for years now. It's certainly a
worthy preservation effort.  I don't object to any policies there.  I
suspect for gamers it's a reasonable place to go for the old standards.
But I'm not a gamer.  In 1974 when I first started authoring the editor
seemed a quantum leap over punched cards.  No more worries about a dropped
deck.  No more repunching a card if you made a typo.
 
But today the text entry facilites on cyber1 are still crude beyond my
tolerance.  On NovaNET we made some small headway by putting some editing
primatives into the the Portal.  We used those for editing in Notes and
TERM-comments.  But they were still too crude for code editing.  We
packaged all the editors in SYSLIB and made them callable from common
non-system lessons.  
 
Then too soon NOVANET was privatized.  Had a few more years passed I expect
the following would have happened.  I know because I was the guy who would
have made it happen...  
 
As delivery became more an internet communication pathway, dedicated
terminals would have rapidly disappeared.  Novanet would have been first
been hosted in "Portals" running on the various GUI based systems.  This
would have enabled the complete transfer of text editing to the local
environment with paths to quickly transfer text up and down.  Again, (the
now much smaller) NovaNET side code would have been packaged into callable
SYSLIB commands.
 
Later, I suspect, but cannot be sure, the Portal could have
optionally lived inside internet browsers much like a "flash" player.  This
could not have been foreseen in 1992-1993.  But I expect we would have come
to it by 2000ish.
 
Going back to cyber1, I find my hands get contorted and sore whenever I try
to squence there.  When we rewrote Notes at CERL we knew that we were going
to catch hell for changing the key bindings.  And so we did.  But the
complaints died out quicky enough. Cyber1 notes keybindings on modern
keyboards is another item that taxes my tolerance.  Fortunately I have a
PLATO USB keyboard to handle that problem.  But that's a little too much to
expect of the vast majority of potential users.
 
I expect I'll hang around cyber1 as the system of last resort.  So I'll see
some of you there.

I started using PLATO in 1974 when a school buddy (Warren Auld) was
going over to CERL to do some work and I tagged along because I was
bored.  I had no idea how much that day would affect my life.
 
My "authors" entry starts in 1976. I'm another self-taught programmer
who never would have started if it hadn't been for "lander".  I was
hooked.
 
While taking classes out a Parkland Community College, I wrote a
multiple choice quiz driver for an instructor there just for the sake of
seeing if I could do it.  It was so successful that he ended up using it
for several years.
 
That work led to a job at the Instructional Television Division (ITV) at
the UIUC campus where I worked on a PLATO V terminal, one of the
new-fangled ones with an Intel 8080 microprocessor with a
user-programmable interface. It was the first place one of those was
located outside of CERL, made available to us thanks to Ron Klass.  I
wrote code with/for it for computer graphics used in video projects on
campus. (Lots of stuff for the Chemistry department, IIRC.) I also wrote
the code for a dual 8" floppy disk controller for it.  That was fun!
 
From there I went to Duosoft, persuaded by Steve Setzler to apply there.
At Duosoft, I worked in Tutor and uTutor on the PCD2/TI994a project with
Dale Sinder and John Loseke. That was a very fun project, coordinating
with CDC up in Minneapolis.
 
Unfortunately, Duosoft had put all its eggs in one basket with the
TI994a, so when Ben Alfano at CDC decided to drop the project, Duosoft
went belly up.
 
I ended up at Regency Systems, working in USE (the Regency variation of
Tutor) on the TEL project with Wayne Hoyenga and John Vanantwerp. Jane
Eades (a small, middle-aged, entirely psychotic chinese woman) drove me
to finally go back to college and finish my degree. That was the last
time I worked in anything resembling Tutor.
 
It was a good run, and I don't know that I'd change a thing.
 
So long, and thanks for all the fiche!

I've been trying to connect to people at Pearson and have had little luck.
 
I don't think they realize the historical significance of NovaNET, how long
back into the past it goes, long before Pearson acquried the company that
had acquired NLI years ago.
 
They have told me they are not going to wipe the disk drives clean, they
will "preserve" all the stuff on this system. However, I'm not confident
as to how seriously they'll archive everything. Nor do I have any hope that
they'll be willing to cut a deal with Cyber1 to provide a permanent, non-
profit home for the lessons, games, and notesfiles here many of which go 
all the way back to PLATO IV on CERL in the 1970s.
 
Gonna miss NovaNET.

That's what I'm guessing too.  But that is entirely due to doubting Pearson
would permit it.
 
The only hope I see is for some organization of national stature to
approach Pearson about it.  Perhaps the University of Illinois.  The
University is much more incline to celebrate this acheivement now than it
was 20+ years ago.

I have made some half-hearted attempts at preventing all the CERL Music
Group's software from dying forever.
 
It would need a PLATO OS of some sort, as well as the appropriate
software.
 
Hard not to sound cynical, but it seems to me that the attitude is "well,
we don't want this novanet stuff any more, so we're going to get rid of
it -- yet even though we consider it to be value-less, we won't let anyone
else have it".
 
In the garbage, and no dumpster diving!

I think that's really foolish on Pearson's part. They are sitting on a 
potential gold mine, imho, with some of the old CERL courseware here. 
Maybe they don't own it, maybe UI does, I dunno.
 
But there are lessons in the chemistry, elem reading, and elem math areas
done back in the 70s that would be excellent apps on, say, an iPad. 
How the West was One, Speedway, Darts, Sentences, Titrate, etc.  
Sure, they'd have to be re-coded and brought up-to-date in terms of 
fancier graphics, but, all doable. Just requires the will to do it.
 
Oh well. Hard to get a team at Pearson, most of whom were born years after
those lessons were designed and coded in TUTOR, to drum up any interest.
Something so old has to be bad, I mean, after all.

Pearson has stated that course data will be available for retrieval for
up to one year past today.  Perhaps after that time they will be more open
to some type of preservation effort.  I imagine there are some level of
contractual obligations that need to be met before anything could be
preserved for historical purposes.
 
Towards this end if anything of this nature _does_ take place I would
be interested in assisting in whatever means necessary to achieve such an
end.

Always figured I'd get a chance to write my "I'm leaving the company" note
on NovaNET.  But I guess that won't happen.
 
I first used PLATO/NovaNET in the either the fall of 79 or the spring of
80, not really sure.  By the summer of 1980 I was hooked.  Starting in the
spring of 1981 was a seven year run when I spent literally thousands of
hours a year on the system.  Then I went into the USAF.  When I got out in
1995, I started working for UCI.  I'm still here.
 
Never found a better on-line community.  One or two, almost as good.  All
things end, and unfortunately it is time for NovaNET to end.

One thing I did was grab the entire "authors" list for Nova.  Since I
can't get the actual data, and I don't know a way to do a printout or
grab ASCII text, I just did the next worst thing: do a video screen
capture of paging through every blasted page, including "LAB for
associated signons" to capture every single thing.
 
I already grabbed CERL authors ages ago when it was possible to log your
session as an ASCII file.  But this time I had to page through manually
for about an hour, including LAB presses, to grab it all while the 
video capture software was grabbing 4 frames per second.
 
Pretty hardcore, if I do say so myself.
 
And now you may tell me how dumb it was, and how I could have simply done
X or Y or Z :-)

Oh that's easy.
 
Sitting with a group of friends late at night, after midnight, in
basement of Smith Hall at Univ of Delaware. Dan Tripp had linkctl 
access, and linked to CERL. It was late '79, early '80. I'd never
seen CERL before. Never seen the games, notesfiles, etc. We all watched
in awe as Dan surfed through every notesfile, a bunch of games, we 
spent hours exploring CERL. I was awestruck. Made the Delaware system
look like the remote outpost island that it was.

I'd have to say the day we converted old notesfiles to new notesfiles.
 
The team:
 
Scott Johnson  - principle programmer / including new text editor TUTOR
G David Frye   - email <-> pnotes exchange
Monica Fortner - HELP and HELP Lesson
Bill Golden and
Ethan Edwards  - New interface and keybindings

None of us are in Iowa, and the servers won't immediately be shut down.  
Just all access by anyone but staff will be shut down.

I know it's silly, but I sure wish I knew what the info was that's 
on the secret Novanet-is-closing page that's referenced in the banner
message...
 
This link, tinyurl.com/o9wju66, goes to a Pearson page that requires
a login to view. Heh. 
 
Could someone email me a screenshot/pdf? I really could use it for
the historical file. I know this stuff sounds obsessive and over-the-
top, but little trivia like this often comes in handy.

The contents of the pdfs?  You wouldn't care.  If you look closely you'll
see it is actually a page about NovaNET Courseware (NNCW) -- not NovaNET.  
NNCW was intended to be the web-based replacement for NovaNET, but it never
quite made it.  It is being retired simultaneously with NN.

Been a long time since I have been close to anything active on PLATO,
but my days with the CERL Music Group were truly a magical time in my
life.
 
Mostly didn't hang out with any of the rest of you in those days,
though I do remember most of the signons from trvth, pad, etc...
 
Adioa...

Being one of those damn CCC people, I've not had the opportunity to meet
most of you in person.  But knowing you on-line has been a highlight of
my on-line life, and an exemplar to building an on-line community I still
hold to (and occasionally succeed at).
 
I'm proud to have contributed to this system -- maybe not in writing the
code that makes the monkeys fly (thanks, TomL!) but in writing a couple
dozen lessons our students used, spending a lot of time writing support
programs to allow our multiple sites to serve tens of thousands of students
each year, providing long-term statistical data to our administration
showing how effective PLATO/Nova was (lotta good that did over the long-
term), and growing a hell of a lot of talent that went on to various other
fields (not to mention more than a few that made significant contributions
to PLATO/NN).
 
Man, I wouldn't have missed that for the world.
 
A younger me might have seen tonight as the ultimate all-nighter, but the
me in front of the keyboard worries about things closer to him, like a wife
recovering from spinal surgery, so this is an all-nighter I will have to
pass on, with the knowledge that the next time I try to connect will fail.
 
Bless you all; you've used your life's skills and passion doing great things
that benefitted so many people.  I'm glad to have done my part.

I was unaware of the deadline until a few hours ago.  Borrowed a signon
for a last spin around. I don't think anyone will mind.
 
NovaNET meant a lot to a whole group of nerdy kids in the late 80s and
early 90s in Maine.  The experience and community here set the bar early
for the rest of my online life, and frankly nothing else has ever come
close.

So where's the notefile sequencer on this thing?  I wanna monitor for new
notes, since There Is No Tomorrow.
 
LATER: found it.  No room for a sequencer.  Bummerz.

If you are intending to make a last second post, be aware that there is
index room left for only 3 more base notes (now) (147/150).
 
So you might want to plan to post that last note as a response.

By the way, I've kermit'ed off the contents of a few notesfiles, including
=pad, and all of my lessons, over the past few days.
 
If anyone wants the contents of any notesfile I have, please contact me at
don@donappleman.com
 
I hope to post a list later tonight; it's really just a few.  If you want
to kermit a notesfile yourself, you can do so --
 
    1 Press Shift-O on the notes index page
    2 Choose option 3
    3 Enter the name of a local file to receive the output
    4 Hit Shift-LAB
 
You've got time; it seems to take only 5 or 10 minutes for most files.

I have more glorious tools for text extraction of files that's much faster.
Guess it's a bit late to tell ya that though.
