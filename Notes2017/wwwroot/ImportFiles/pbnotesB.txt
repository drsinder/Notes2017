Many thanks to all the participants! At the very least,
you have made our lives easier by providing material to
with which to fill the tapes. At worst, you got a little
practice at that time honored PLATO activity: display
generation and/or animation!!

All entries are on display in lesson "tapejudge".
(Honorable mentions WILL be used in the tapes also.)

Were all references to charsets in "charsett" to be changed
to "charsets" in the recent system conversion? I have
a lesson in which the old name was not converted. The
charset involved in now in charsets, I find.

Yes, a conversion was fun, I _think_ that all references
should have been changed. Why don't you send a pnote
to rader/s about your specific case.

---------- note 7 groupnotes
  03/26/76     11.24     clark       lawyer

Many authors have asked for an index of groupnotes files.
Since I think this is a good idea and many authors have
mentioned it before, I have decided to create a notesfile
for this purpose. If a systems index is ever created.
my notesfile will become obsolete. Until then, feel free
to enter the name and description of notesfiles that you
think people would be interested in viewing. Please 
indicate the type of access to the file.

It would be better if groupnotes file directors were the
ones to enter the title of groupnotes.

Let me know of any problems in a p-note as I don't want
the file cluttered with irrelevant comments.

The name of the file is "groupnotes".

it. However a group should also have the right to go
public if it wants to do that.

I am sure that if those in favor of restricted conferences
would spend an entire month climbing mountains, walking
25 miles per day, canoeing our rivers and similar activities
their possessive impulse concerning conferencing would 
change.

Mr. Carter:

One or another of my children, when unable to wrest a
desired toy from his sibling accuses the other of being
selfish, as though "What's mine is mine" were a more
pernicious philosophy than "What's yours belongs to us."

Your recent remarks sound like my children's.

My remarks apply only to the academic community. I am in
favor of restricted conferencing for the business world.
I simply think the open attitude i have suggested is part
of the implied contract one accepts when joining the 
University--as a student or staff member.

---------- note 11 edit micro
  03/26/76     12.01     celia       pso

In lesson "helping" there is a microtable for editing, to
be included in lesson "micros" eventually. I designed
it after looking at the very nice editing micros by
parrello of mfl, bowery of comm, and moore of chema.
I would appreciate comments about it--does it contain the
right stuff, too much, too little, are things on the
right keys?

---------- note 15 word=stop1
  03/26/76     12.17     alan       hebrew

Can someone tell me what the system reserved word "stop1"
is. Got a condense error saying it was redefined.

---------- response 1
  03/26/76     12.21     michael       english

Each function key on the keyset is defined by the system so
that things like this work:

branch key=stop1,x,1

You tried to redefine it.

---------- response 2
  04/02/76     15.23     putch       arizona

     But what good is it? A branch which branches to a
point if stop1 wasn't pressed might as well be an
unconditional branch, and one that branches when stop1 _is_
pressed might as well not be there since it does nothing.

---------- note 21 editmicro
  03/26/76     13.54     judy       pso

I just discovered to my surprise that the micro which
is associated with lesson editting is still in effect
when I return to the AUTHOR MODE page. Is this intended?

Could you PLEASE make the system constants z<x>p<y>
available to the condensor? They can't be used to define
segments at this time (let alone anything else that can't
  handle variable args at condense time).

---------- response 1
  03/27/76     08.25     judy       pso

I don't know what you are talking about. I suppose the
systems people to whom your note is directed know.

Since PUBLIC NOTES also serves an educational purpose, I
would appreciate a bit of explanation with a cryptic
request like this.

1) what purpose do these letters serve?
2) how specifically do they inconvenience you now?
3) how would you like to use them (example) if they
  were released to you?
4) what other methods have you tried unsatisfactorily?

---------- response 2
  03/27/76     11.04     john r       reading
He's talking about such things as
zdswpr
which define various system parameters of great potential
use in writing more-probably-exportable-to-as-yet-undefined-
future-systems.

---------- response 3
  03/27/76     16.08     frye       mfl

More specifically, he's referring to

        zwpb,zbpw,zbpc,zcpw

-- which are system-dependent. Does that clarify the
"z<x>p<y>"?

---------- response 4

Yes, thank you.

---------- response 5
  03/29/76     11.21     friedman       csa

Now that we all understand the question, could someone
generate an answer? Can the system symbols zwpb, zbpw,
zcpw, zbpc, etc. be defined to the condensor as constants,
so that it will accept them in commands like -common-,
-storage-, and -define segment-?

---------- note 25 thesis
  03/26/76     15.21     clegg       amesrad

       I need to include a copy of the program for my
lesson in a thesis. I can't just use a print-out, because
there are some branches which would extend past the 8 1/2
? 11 format. There aren't a great number of these branches
--maybe 2 per block or so--so I'm not sure that photo-
reduction is the answer. I hate to ask for varians
because it would require quite a few pages.
       Has anyone dealt with this problem before? I'd
like to know what others have tried and recommend.

Several years ago, students got the U. of Ill. authorities
to change the rules and allow computer printouts to be
folded and put in an envelope attached to the inside
back cover of their thesis. You might get your school
to adopt such a rule if it doesn't have one already.

---------- response 2
  03/26/76     16.05     chabay       chem

For my thesis, I photographed the displays from the
screen. If you use panatomic-x film, you can do a
reversal development, and the prints come out as black
on white, and look quite nice. The advantage of
photographs over printouts is that the code is much
more readable (I still can't remember what all the
funny printer symbols mean.)

---------- response 3
  03/26/76     17.00     fumento       pso

    I suggest that you contact the med people. They
have a special GE terminet printer hooked into a terminal
which can list printouts on what I believe is 8.5?11 paper.

---------- response 4
  03/26/76     17.40     david       hebrew

Also: you may try to find a reducing xerox machine
somewhere on your campus. It makes very nice 8.5?11.
copies from normal computer-sized paper.

The Terminet prints are available in any size width from
4" to 12.5" depending on paper used. The long lines are
continued with indentation (both margins can be set).
Except for a the greek letters in the access set and fonted
characters the text looks very close to the PLATO Editor
panel display. Upper and lower case are both available and
characters like ¬0¬1¬<¬>?? are made up of composite characters
using backspaces. If you are interested in this we might be
able to help. It depends on time constraints for you.

  When you set a microtable to be loaded using the
DATA1 option from the block directory page of the editor,
the last block edited flag is apparently set to block
1-a. Is this intended?

  Nope; that should be fixed--the intention of the
mark for last editing of that first block is that it
reflect only changes to the source text in it, not
changes to the lesson directory information (which also
happens to be in that block). Thanks.

  Well, the author of this note had something
a little more fruitful in mind. Surely we could
preempt Fortran with a language with greater number
crunching ability than TUTOR, APL, perhaps?
     =  At any rate, suggestions as to WHICH LANGUAGE
WE SHOULD USE are invited.

What's wrong with FORTRAN? If you are clever (I'm not
saying that you are.) you can do anything in FORTRAN that
you can do in assembler. You can't get more versatile
than that.

---------- response 4
  03/27/76     16.06     frye       mfl

What's more, the simpler format of FORTRAN lends itself
more easily to object code optimization... I'm not saying
it's such a great multi-purpose language, but it certainly
is
   1) easy to learn (especially for non-CS jocks) 
   2) easy to program with, and
   3) lends itself easily to the number-crunching
      programs often needed by engineers.

APL? You're crazy. Period.

  03/27/76     16.26     luke       cornell

     Alright, but if you want to do anything with
characters EASILY, FORTRAN just doesnt have the commands.
TOOTER is nice for the student initiated branching, and
the judging capabilities, A P L Is great for matrices
and vector handling, and SNOBOL is good for list processing.

    But what we need is a language that can handle
all these things universally; I favour PL/I Optimizer for
any kind of work except PLATO, its almost as fast as
FORTRAN. although nothing can ever replace assembler
for versatility ans speed, PL/I is the most convenient
for any programmer who wants to expand.

    1: FORTRAN, although a reasonably powerful lang-
uage, cannot begin to "do nearly everything you can in
assembler"; e.g., writing your own access methods, recur-
sive subroutine calls, dynamic storage allocation, etc.
However it does have a fairly fast compiler and produces
fairly efficient object code. And certain versions of it,
like WATFIV, with its excellent debugging facilities, are
very good as a first programming language.
     2: APL, an extremely powerful language syntactic-
ally--especially with regard to array operations, neverthe-
less is fairly inefficient in execution; not so good for
real number crunching except, possibly, in devising algo-
rithms. Also, it does not implement complex arithmetic.
However, as interactive language, it's hard to beat.

    3: ALGOL, more powerful than FORTRAN, nevertheless
drives me nuts keying in the reserved word delimiters. It
also has lousy I/O. If I need its capabilities, I would
much rather use
      4: PL/I, the language that tries to be everything
to everybody and generally succeeds; except for those who
demand efficient compilation and object code. However. you
can do nearly everything you can do in assembler (except
for your own access methods) and if, you're careful, you
can make the object code nearly as efficient as that pro-
duced by FORTRAN; but not quite.

    5: What's this business about punched cards anyway?
I though every facility worth mentioning had essentially
eliminated the need for an actual physical deck of cards;
substituting, perhaps, card images on a DASD file, which
is submitted to the input batch stream after appropriate
editing.
     6: Basically, after all this, I have to agree with
Parello, that anyone should have the processing language he
or she needs available--even if it's some monstrosity like
STAGE II!

---------- response 14
  03/27/76     22.36     frye       mfl

Almost everyone at the U of I in Urbana has to use punched
cards -- in fact, it's hard NOT to find a CS freak who does-
n't have a big box of them under his arm...

As for your claim that ALGOL has lousy IO and something
(very unclear) about delimiters, let me say that I have
found Burroughs extended ALGOL to be an excellent high-
level language with but one fault: it doesn't have high-
level data structures, unless you define them yourself
(a feature not present in many regular ALGOL compilers).
PL/1 might be the best all-around, if it wasn't for the
utter ugliness of the language -- there's just not as much
structure to it: My first rule in PL/1 is to stick in
a semi-colon every 3rd word; it never fails then!

And you can write access methods, recursive subroutines,
and dynamic memory allocation schemes in FORTRAN. Remember,
I said you had to be clever. If you can't figure it out.
send me a pnote and I will show you one of FORTRAN's
neatest features.

G. David:
   It's true that the 360 at U=?I can't be used interactively,
but it's not all that hard to master the DEC-10, which
allows interactive FORTRAN, among other things, and permits
you to run batch jobs on the 360 without the need for cards.
I think it would be more accurate to state that most true
CS jocks would be carrying around an Infoton terminal, not
a box of cards, if that were possible.

Also, you DEC-10 people might get a kick out of looking
at a language called SAIL, which is based on ALGOL

The PLI Level X Optimizing Compiler has everything that
has been discussed in these notes. The compiler is quick
(it slows down a little when you ask for "ultimate"
optimization, but you don't compile a program in that
manner very often). It produces VERY efficient object
code, and, believe it or not, is relatively useful
for writing interactive procedures (before I did PLATO
in it I would want multiple ATTENTION keys).
The associated PLI Checkout Compiler is very useful in
debugging.
  As for "structure", I find the syntactical "free-form"
very useful; just remember what you are doing and the
semicolons seem to fall into place naturally.
  Don't destroy FORTRAN; it's a nice little language
for learning first, it lets you realize how fortunate
you are to have PLI, and some people like to dink around
with it.

I havent seen a language that I like yet. Each has its
bad features. None has a flexible yet fast method for
making new commands in any language that the system can
support, adjusting them to the system's standard, optim-
izing them, and allowing them to be used in any language
on the system.

PL rates quite well. Tooter gets a plus as being the
best educational language and one of the better graphics
languages (DALI from MIT is the best graphics language
that I've seen, talk about flexibility!).

PL was created in order to completely replace FORTRAN.
They changed it so much that instead of calling it something
like FORTRAN 5, they renamed it. Just as well get rid
of the dumb languange...

Cards! Yeckkkk, no self-respecting CS person would be
seen with them!

       Nobody mentioned BASIC! PDP-11 RSTS speaks only
Basic-Plus. This is a language which takes some of the
best features of fortran, algol, etc. and puts them together
for a rather powerful system. It took the 'else','while'
and 'until' statements from algol and coupled them with
the 'if' statement normally found in Basic. Virtual arrays
and Record-oriented I/O make this a fine interactive
language that is easy to learn. We have students as young
as 7 years coming here to Project Solo to learn programming
and they learn surprisingly fast. My vote is for
Basic-Plus!

the choice, myself. PL/I could use a few improvements,
but its the best thing going right now.
(And I wont comment on ALGOL, I'm sure it's a fine
language, but I'd like to find more machines that use it)

I suppose I am overlooking something, but I have been unable
to get the 'justification' feature of SM to function in any
way differently than normal text insertion.
I _did_ remember to set the right hand margin, but the text
would still run past it to the right edge of the screen,
both in SD mode and upon condensing.

       I would like to see the '¬W' in the right hand

Justification only pads spaces and half-spaces into the

       And you have to hit LAB to turn the justifier on,
while you are writing the text itself. The little word
"Normal" that comew on when you are writing text turns
to "Centered" and "Justified" in succession when you hit
LAB.

Yes, I knew about using LAB to set the justification option.
Also, a friend told me about the fact that the "justifica-
tion" option not being able to truncate a line; it might be
a good idea, Midden, to mention this fact in the help sec-
tion on text insertion. It's no big thing, but it could
serve to prevent confusion on this point in the future.

Another suggestion: how difficult would it be to "draw"
two vertical lines, one on the left hand side of the
screen (not essential), and one on the right hand side,
to mark the margins that were selected??
This would appear only during the text insertion.?

Perhaps a Text Insertion which has requested justification
could use a -long- to prevent overextending a line. Then
an extra LAB (or something) would act like "margin release"
on a typewriter.

To avoid confusion: This discussion is covering TWO TYPES
of monitoring. The first is (apparently) the monitor mode
in which one finds oneself upon pressing LAB1 while -talk-

that is initiated by an author in course records on a user
in his/her course.

The typing speed problem is apparently present in both
situations. Obviously, the students running display would
not be seen by monitor-_ee_'s in the first instance.

Interesting data!

Carrying another day into each new notes file, however, will
just make the turn-around time for a file one day shorter.

It's not much more difficult to go into the most recent
archive to read a particular day's notes than it is to
read notes for any day in the current Public Notes file.
(You have to type the actual date rather than press -BACK-
until you get there.)

It would be helpful though if the HELP section for
Public Notes could more fully explain how to get to
archives. It is not obvious that you can type in an OLD
date and be taken into an archive. I really had a difficult
time finding archives the first time I tried.

Also, when an author sees note ¬$0 at the top of his list,

It shows that over 84: of the responses were made within

do NOT show is

  1) the time required to get the desired response (i.e.
     a system response or the answer to a question
  2) lag time on responses to notes which are of a general
     interest...for example, see george carter's note in
     recent archives.

My guess is that the results of (1) would be will within
a 24-hour limit; (2) is not relevant since a particularly

Maybe the public notes file could be extended and then

The last line of the previous block was missing its
"end-of-line" indicator, so the first line of the
next block was a continuation of it. Thus, your -unit-
command was a continuation of a write statement.
When you had an "*" in front of the unit command,
the "*" was part of the -write-, and the unit was
condensed properly.

However, by the time I got around to looking 
at your file, you had made some modifications to 
the previous block, so there was an "eol" on the
last line... and the problem was "fixed".

The only way I know for this to happen is with
a common-to-source conversion.

being able to enter more than one course for a particular

send the note to all of the signons, and/or whenever the 
person signs on, it sends it to that particular course, so
that he wouldn't have a number of the same note lying
around. For example:

        Being able to send a note to more than one course
at once would by a convenience, but only a minor one. It 
is pretty easy to send copies of notes now, and I'm sure
that most of the authors on the system only have one sign-
on anyway.

        Also, I don't think the latter part of your sug-
gestion--delaying the sending of the note until the person
signs on--is feasible. The note has to be stored some-
where in the interim, and things just aren't set up to

When one presses NEXT on the block display page, an arrow
indicates the last block entered. However, if you go
into, say, block "b", then go to "c" by pressing NEXT1, or
back to "a" through BACK1, then leave or condense the 
lesson, the arrow will still indicate block "b" when you
return and press NEXT. Often this makes no difference,but
if you are out of a lesson for several days (or maybe even
hours), and assume that the arrow will tell you where you
were editing last, you will be wrong. If there is a lot
of similar-but-not-identical code, or the lesson is long,
you may have trouble finding your place. Could the ¬D be

It _is_ updated whenever you finish editing a block in any

stored to the nearest minute, so if you change two blocks

Hmmmm. I think it was an allowable feature for a few days,
but due to negative user reaction it was removed. It was
finally decided only allow a person to turn on / off his
TALK and NOTE options by himself, i.e. not to allow a
course director to turn on / off these options.

We thus hope to put an extra option off of the user
display to allow one to accomplish this, but have not done
so yet.

   Last summer, when arrays were announced, it was noted

With touch panels, you can move the cursor either by
touch OR by the arrow keys.

For tracing, I suppose that the touch could be a nuisance
as you ran your finger along the line just to "keep track".
Turning the touch off would be handy for that case, but
you CAN use the arrow keys.

One of our instructors wanted to set up a sequence with
review for his students who had been using the usual index
page previously.

He set up the sequence on the module page as module 1.
Unfortunately, he failed to template the students to
this new set up. Then he had them do the 1st lesson
he wanted on the last page of the index modules.

Now he wants to have all the students just go through
his sequence, but he is concerned that they would lose 
their place in the lesson or credit if he did the 
template now. Is this concern correct?

---------- response 1
  03/29/76     13.01     chabay       s
Students who have already completed the lesson will have
no problem. In fact, the sequence with review should
allow them to begin with the second lesson in the sequence.
However, templating the curriculum assignment for students
who are in the middle of the lesson will indeed cause them
to lose restart status.
A possible solution would be to set up the curriculum so
that completion of the lesson in question is the criterion
for completing the index module, and that after completing
the index module, students are sent to the sequence with
review module. That way, students will be sent to 
the sequence after completing that lesson, and will
then be able to proceed with the rest of the sequence.

for plato to do some special things with writing, and
are by no means released, or public. You should not use
them in any "serious" work, as their function could become

If the author does a shift-STOP condense, PLATO has no
choice but to assume that the author _wants_ new copy of the
lesson brought in, and this requires deleting the student.

If you (the author) do not want this to happen, condense
the lesson with DATA from the Author Mode page.

Here's something I'm curious about:

        Why do people justify lines in their notes?
I have never had any trouble reading notes that aren't
justified, and I'm sure that the use of half-spaces will
make the eventual printing of notes as difficult to read
as animation does. Also, it's distracting to have those
little 'breaks' when plotting justified lines. To top it
all off, I feel like I am reading a form letter from some 
insurance agency, since they are among the few groups who 
feel compelled to justify letters. See, you were able

It sure would be nice if half-spaces were hard-wired so the
framer doesn't have to keep resetting the terminal *at*
location, thus slowing transmission and plotting, and in-
creasing the amount of bits that need to be sent.

If it is of any interest to anyone, in timing tests using
the justified and unjustified version of the note which
began this sequence, the justified version took 30: more
time to plot and 15: more CPU than the normal version.

Anyone know if the PLATO V terminal has hard-wired half-

You will learn in time that that wonderful lesson "aids"
contains many answers to these seemingly obscure problems.
According to the "aids" writeup (in part): "Binary refers
to the condensed version of the lesson." In other words
when you request to run a lesson in "student mode" it is
gotten from the disk and condensed. The lesson then resides
in memory (ECS) so that you may "execute" or "use" it.

The "aids" writeup goes on to explain how copies of binaries
are made on subsequent requests to use the lesson.

---------- response 2

(Sort of forgot the first part of your question): Whenever
we load different versions of the PLATO software into the 
computer, the old copies of lesson binaries (made while
operating under the previous version) are automatically
destroyed. This is to ensure compatibility in the manner
in which the lessons behave under the new version of the 
PLATO software.

---------- response 3
  03/30/76     11.56     judy       pso

Thus, with a new version of PLATO, each lesson requested
must be "condensed" anew. Normally, as students drift in
the lessons are condensed little by little during the day.
When everybody tries to condense all at once we get the 
big condense queues.

Condensing is a very "expensive" operation for the computer.

       I'm sure you would believe me if I said that
1 $cls$ 60 = 1. If you'd also believe that 1 $cls$ 120
= 1, then you'd be wrong! Actually 1 $cls$ 120 =
o04000000000000000000, and 1 $cls$ 124 = 1! Other large
big circular left shifts give similar results.
        Seems to be off by 4 bits every 60, due to a mask-
ing problem, I guess. Can it be fixed?

The hardware in the computer that does the circular
left shift uses the bottom 6 bits to determine the 
amount of the shift. and bit 17 to determine whether
to do a circular left shift or an arithmetic right
shift. [Bits numbered high bit=59, low bit=0.]

I think you have to live with it.

HOT NEWS FLASH:

The New Jersey Supreme Court today ruled that Karan Quinlan
did indeed have the "right to die" -- the historic decision,
which overturned a lower court ruling, stated that since
Karen would never be able to regain control of herself, and
since Mr. Quinlan was her legal guardian, he could (after
obtaining agreement by a team of doctors picked if necessary
by himself) allow the artificial machines which keep Karen
alive to be disconnected. An appeal to the decision has not
been mentioned at this time.

That is because the charset editor and the lineset editor
are not in the same lesson as the Block Directory Page, and
those lessons are not smart enough to remember which part
the char/lineset is in. That means that when they -jumpout-
to the lesson with the Block Directory Page, the pointers
get reinitialized, and you are in part one. The delete
option, on the other hand, is in the same lesson, so the
pointers are saved. I imagine that the reason that this is
not fixed is that doing so would be rather messy...

I have written a lesson which will enable authors to:

  1) store in datasets a large number of displays written
     in TUTOR using the basic presentation commands, and

  2) execute those displays for only a minimum charge
     of ECS.

This is especially useful when trying to write your own
router. You may program 100's of index pages and only
be charged for about 400 words of ECS.

See lesson "tutordis" for details (student mode).

I'd like to see your implementation of it. We have used
such a method of displaying text, problems, even judging
student answers and scoring! The best rationale I can
offer is that with a 80+ terminal site, we need to save
as much ECS as we can, and this is one way of doing it.
Also, there has been some discussion of designing editor/
drivers for use by non-computer teachers, etc. who wish
to stick to a basic format and do not desire to learn the
intricacies of TUTOR (they didn't have the "20 minutes" re-
quired to learn it, I suppose!).

We are building a -use-able driver/editor that has a
few more options than -mrouter- (like 16 topics and 
access to a general jumpout list if the instructor
wishes...) Entry is controlled by an Access Control
List much as is used for access control of gnotes.
The information is stored in a 64 word record length
dataset and is loaded directly into student vars...
Common is 322 words and will allow backout of any
student in the router. The editor is in a separate
lesson so that only the essential minimum ECS usage
is charged.

We are doing a great deal of work in this area. It is

Techniques such as this are useful in some cases (Most of
aids runs in such an interpretive mode.) but you have to
be warry of the price you pay in added CPU load and disk
activity. Lessons which use very frequent disk accesses
may have trouble on this system as our use of disks
increases. They are much more likely to run into diffi-
culties on other systems which are likely to be running
a standard range of computer jobs (with heavy disk use)
along with PLATO.

   There was a recent change in this area as a first attempt
to clear up some peculiarities. Units that contain arrows
which are joined used to be able to "unjoin" before
the arrow had been satisfied. Thus you could find
that commands which followed the -do- of a unit that had
an arrow would be executed TWICE--once as regular commands
following the matching of an answer and a second time
after the answer was correct. This mystic doing of
things in previous units before completing the current
arrow seems of extremely doubtful use and almost certainly
very confusing.
   If you put an ok command after the arrow in your
example, then the writing is done as soon as an answer
is given--but not before (which seems reasonable). Please
contact me if you want to discuss this further or have
more complete examples to show where problems arise.

It seems to have something to do with the fact that your
origin is so close to the left margin (32,176), because
when I took the same code and moved to origin to (50,176),
it worked perfectly.

(And by the way, the graphing simulation in Aids does
things even stranger with the original code!)

   This has been mentioned before, and I thought had been
put into aids. The -label- stuff does a leftspace by the
width of the largest label expected to place the labely's
on the screen. If your axis is so close to the left
screen margin that it backspaces past zero, then the
auto writing formatter puts it down on the next line.
If you don't like this, you can either
    a) move your origin to the right a bit
    b) put on your own labels
The choices made by -label- are compromises which seem
to suit most people but cannot fit every possible
artistic choice of every author.

  By the way, one of the reasons that the number 0 was put

separate it from the letter o. Despite this and our

I believe we brought this up before a long time ago but
since we could still use it I was wondering if a leslist
could be used directly in the -dataset- command. This would
be very helpful to use in changing from developmental to

   dataset <N>,RW,code     where N is an expression for
                            the leslist position.

Of course, it would also be advantageous to use a leslist in

   -micro-, -charset-, -lineset-, and -common- commands.

Although, if the single tag form of these commands were made
available then these would probably suffice.

a -leslist <N>, xxx- is not unreasonable. As for the

about single tag commands, although executable -common-s
(if we had access to them) should also be -leslist-able.

not inspecting it) until a lesson has accessed it? It
thinks that it is all of 322 words long until I use it
at some point outside the editor. Or is it that some;

1) Yes, there are interactions between the various

   understand what is going on.

2) The common editor knows how to edit the common on disk
   or in ECS. You get a different choice page for each
   type of editing.

3) If the common is not in ECS, it doesn't know how long
   the lesson thinks the common is... just how long it
is on disk.

I think you should get someone to explain to you how
common works and what all the options do.

From the -It would be nice- dept.

    How about allowing an author to connect some type
of a datafile to a specific lesson. This way an author
could collect data on his lesson's performance no matter
what course ran the lesson. In particular, it would be
nice to record whenever an execution error occured.
    Some possible ways of adding this feature, would be
1) on the lesson page, be able to specify a datafile to
be used by this lesson. 2) Create a new type of block, such
as a 'data' block. This could then be loaded by a lesson
with a 'datafile' command similar to the common command.
    I am sure that they are many other ways of doing
this, but I would like to know the feasibility of this
idea. How about it sys. progs.

There is a problem (ethical and legal) with allowing
people other than real course instructors to collect
data which identifies specific students. I think it is
very undesirable to allow authors unconditional access
to such data (and all of our present data records do
identify students by name.) In the past, I've found
instructors at other institutions to be very cooperative
in allowing me to have access to data on my lessons
generated by their students, when I explained that the
students' names would not be displayed in any way.
      In addition, in trying to interpret such data, I
have found it important to know HOW the lessons were used-
the students' background, whether their use of PLATO was
optional or required, time limits on use, etc.
      Execution errors are a possible exception -
but allowing a student to dump data into two different

be formatted in a possibly different form and put in common?

Risken certainly has a good point about "published"
lessons. Occasional execution errors are inevitable,
and it is essential to be able to "trap" them and make
that information available.

It is often easier to de-bug if you know that Sally Jones
was 3-deep in a help sequence, etc, etc., but the mere
FACT that an execution error occured in a given unit is
often enough information.

I am very aware of this right now, since I just added
"score" to 20 lessons (not mine) at the request of users
and the author. Such additions are very susceptible to
dumb typos; there is no way for me to get feedback on
execution errors except by p-notes. Not very satisfactory.

---------- note 309 SD bug
  03/31/76     21.16     snellen       medneta

Just discovered a bug in the new SD. When drawing an arc,
one receives the instruction, "mark a center point with an
O" after the first endpoint has been entered; that is fine
so far. However, it is often very desirable to get an up-
date on the position of the cursor by pressing NEXT in order
to be sure that the center point and the second endpoint
are precisely positioned; unfortunately, when one does this,
SD seems to forget where the first endpoint was located so
it is very difficult to precisely position the end and mid-
points of the arc.
This is critical in the lesson I am writing so it
would be much appreciated if this problem could be
corrected.

this case.

Just a casual suggestion: when using the SD option to draw
an arc, almost always I'd prefer to enter the other endpoint
of the arc prior to entering the "point in between".

Secondly, a lot of the time I'd like to try out several
"points in between", while retaining the two endpoints in
order to create the arc with the curvature actually desired.

Can the routine be changed to accomodate this desire - do
others have major objections to this proposal?

Also -- I concluded that the modes used in SD and that used
in SS (similar to that suggested here) are both desireable,
under some conditions. I think the SD method should be the
default, with the SS option available when needed.

Since one does get to thinking about how to draw the circles
while in the midst of drawing them, I would like to keep
O as the only key for establishing a point while in partial
circle mode. One tends to forget the functions of other
keys under such conditions, and whatever functions they
have should be innocuous.

A given key should always perform the same function with

have exactly the same effect on the cursor, whether one is

       entitled 'gamenotes'. It can be accessed either

Plato's clock seems to be a bit fast. 1 minute and 18
seconds to be exact. Am I correct, or is my watch
wrong? Is the plato clock generally correct, or is
the time it gives only approximately correct? I had
assumed for a long time that since in the editor the
time is given to the exact second, the clock would be
depended on. How about this?

The clock is set by manual entry at the time the system
is loaded in the morning. Factors mediating its accuracy
are: a) The accuracy of the wall clock used as reference
in the machine room; and b) The ability of the operator
to tell time.

Popular rumor has it that one day we will have a hardware
clock which will be both accurate and automatic.

Destroy the record and recreate it. The very useful option
of changing a record type was removed when the new records
editor was unveiled because it was the concensus of opinion

Not having to destroy and then create a record allows

to leave an open password for a while, or having to contact
the person off-line to pre-arrange a new password.

In short, what could be done in seconds with complete
security if (limited) record-type changing were allowed
could take days to completely resolve otherwise, given
the need for off-line communications.

     System 32 is probably, barring the portable 5100
computer, IBM's smallest machine. It is intended
almost solely for use by small business firms and contains
an integral disk drive, keyboard, and line printer.
In keeping with the concept of never giving the user
credit for any more intelligence than it takes to
mail checks to their corporate headquarters, IBM
has made it next to impossible to program the 32 in
any kind of machine language, or indeed, in anything
other than the microinterpreted business language that
the 32 uses. Perhaps you are thinking of the IBM system
3 or the 5100 desk computer instead, although neither
of them fills the minicomputer bill. As far as I know,
IBM still hasn't come up with anything resembling a
minicomputer.

Does -inhibit jumpchk- inhibit the checking for the

if there is not 1500 words available, will it return

Also, the jumpchk is currently for 1000 words. If you
are the only one in the lesson you are leaving, it
takes that amount of ECS into account. It should, if the
lesson you are going to is already in ECS, check for that
amount of ECS rather than 1000, but that hasn't been put
in yet. It does not do the jumpchk if the new lesson

I have an interface that connects a Plato terminal to the

NO modifications to the Plato terminal. On the Altair end,
the interface is built on a Processor Technology wire-wrap
board and plugs into the Altair bus. I have an up to date
wire list of the board, so duplicating it would require
2 days of wire-wrapping. The board and sockets cost $60.
The TTL circuits for the interface cost perhaps $40
assuming you buy from a discount house.($1.25 for a SN74194)
The interface will drive a standard Plato terminal upto

The only time a student can get "bounced" for ECS is
when attempting to do a -jumpout- with insufficient ECS.
In that case you have errtype=3 available to use.

The system word "backout" is for cases over which you have
no control. A -jumpout- is done on purpose...you _do_ have
control over that; the two things should not be mixed up

Semiconductor memory is cheap enough now to use for the

        Animation in system notes is strongly frowned upon.
This is because it will eventually be possible to print
notes, and the invisible characters which control the ani-
mation effects (backspaces, halfspaces, etc.) make for
pretty unreadable prints.

        Furthermore, the features which permit screen ani-
mation in notes are unannounced and, therefore, unsupported
by the system. That means that they could change tomorrow,
and your pretty little animation would end up looking pretty
silly.

I imagine a -long-, -write-, or anything else would be
ignored, also. Careful testing with TERM step shows that,
after executing the -arrow- command in unit "arrow",
regular state execution continues past the -arrow- (as it
should), but only until the end of the -join-ed unit;
then instead of "unjoining", it stops to await a response.
This seems to be the essence of the change.?
I have some real programs which could be seriously effected
by such subtle changes in this area. The example given
in this note seems to me to be an abbreviated version of
a perfectly valid and useful construct.

   Unfortunately as I noted earlier, the current structure
also has a very large number of problems and some peculiar
possibilities which can cause commands following the
join/do of a unit containing an arrow to be done more than
once. It is unfortunate that the beginnings of work in
this area got carried on to the prime time version without
proper notification; the "old" way will be restored some
time soon until this area can be examined and fixed
completely and adequate warning and explanation provided.
   The essence of the proposed change is that return
("un-doing" or "un-joining") from a unit that contains
an arrow will occur only once: after the arrow has been
satisfied--i.e., the question answered correctly. This
will mean that any unit containing an arrow will have to
have the associated judging in that unit or ones joined
from it--and not in ones prior to it.

  Lesson= repair. If terminal has been reported already,
the program tells you so and provides 3 options:

  1. press LAB to see earlier reports.
  2. press BACK to exit.
  3. press NEXT to submit another report.

  Since these options appear without erasing the previous
page, they are easy to miss . . .
especially since the 'NEXT' option is taken so readily by
pressing the 'next' key a second time.

  I suggest that the 'submit another report' option be
associated with a key other than 'next' to reduce un-

Keeping in mind the precident of the -compute- pointer
I would like to suggest making it possible to commit part
of one's storage (s.b.?) variables to keeping track of
nested units -term-ed to (and maybe -do-ne).
The idea of this being that when one wants to use a -term-
one might meet with a definition of that -term- that is
in turn using a term to be -term-ed... etc..etc.. ad inf..

After getting to a low enough level of abstraction in
definition the student could just press BACK to go to the
last level from which he could keep -term-ing till
that level was clear at which time he would press BACK
again...etc..etc..ad inf..
  In subjects where concepts are well structured it is
conceivable that the whole lesson could be written in
-term-s of its title!

I may simulate this anyway for "library" with the -jumpout-
command but I would rather not.

I don't think "pointer" is comparable to your suggestion.
"pointer" just contains information which says....
at CM location XXX there is information tagged by the
identifier YYY. (XXX and YYY are both stuffed into pointer)

There is no nesting or anything of that sort implied.
Either location XXX matches the identifier YYY, in which
case the compute proceeds directly; or else XXX does not
match YYY, in which case the code listed in the compute
is re-compiled and then the compute is done.

The similarity I was refering to was intrinsic in the
term you used: "pointer". Both the -compute- pointer
and the "stack" used to keep track of nested unit
computations are "pointer"s to locations not normally
accessable to users.

Where did you go in AIDS? Some sections use special

the system must reload the previous charset again, since
it doesn't know which characters were destroyed.

Once-upon-a-time, I was careful to use characters for AIDS
from the wierd part of the charset... like FONT ?=?? etc...
so that when you returned to your own lesson you would
probably not notice that the characters in the terminal
had been changed. However, now that we have automatic
loading of character sets any change causes the charset
to reload. I think that is what you are seeing.... not
a change in AIDS, but rather a change in the way the editor
is handling the charsets.

Why is option 'P' not allowed in archive notes?
It's not as if you were responding to the note in

If you're in an archive file, it requires that pnotes
remember more information so that it can return you to
the right place. This may get done some day, but for the
first implementation of the option it wasn't considered
important enough to go to the extra trouble.

If the monitoree could initiate the transformation, then

Suggestion for condense queue:

At present (correct me if I am wrong) position in queue
(for authors) is a function of total condensor usage per
author as compared with others in the queue.

        How about having it dependent on
(total condensor usage)/((time in queue)+.1)

(The .1 is to eliminate 1/0 if that is a problem)

That way, if one was really desparate to condense, one
could wait around in the queue until enough time had elapsed
so that one's priority would be higher.

Time in queue would be reset upon each entry into the queue

  Remember it is not your total condensing time, but 
your ratio of condensing time to time on the system.
If you are expecting lots of service--whether via large
jobs every so often or small jobs very often--then your
priority is worse than someone less demanding on the
average. I don't think I see how it is "fairer" if
you are promoted in the queue just because you have
been waiting longer than others this particular condense
attempt. If we can afford the time to make such a 
distinction, this would be an appropriate "tie-breaker"
mechanism to decide amongst people with the same priority
otherwise.

        I agree with the origonal comment, with a slight
modification. The 'time in' factor should not be the
only determination of the order in the Q, but should
become a factor if a person has been waiting for a 
while, becomming more important the longer he waits.
         After going in and finding:
2 of 2, then 6 of 6, then 1 of 1, then 8 of 8,....
(well, you've probably been there) one tends to give up.
        If it's too hard to include ok, but I do think
that it's good idea.

   While the new options in the editor (U for -use-d

is these kind of extra features that continue to uphold
PLATO as the best CAI system! It still has the most
educationally oriented commands and strives to give the 
author a maximum of control with ease of use! The in-

'there is no more room in the course note file...etc'
_regardless_ of whether or not the person recieving the

From the 'wouldn't it be loverly' dept:

        In the new course editor, how about putting the
inspect options before the change options? That way the 
key sequence isn't totally changed when one goes back and
forth between change and inspect only. Example: to get 
to the list of people running in inspect one presses '2'
then 'c'; while in edit mode, '2' then 'f'. Yes, I know
that if some options were turned off for a person, the
options would still be screwed around, but he will never 
see what he's missing, thus no adjustments need be made.

Well, just thinking...

Why doesn't someone fix up the editor so that you can get
the author information (from the DATA page) even if the
inspect is restricted. Sometimes I have had to look for
quite a while to find the author of a lesson when I wanted
to talk to him. It would be nice if the name of the author
would come up on the 'Type the security code' page so that
people could find him if he did not sign his lesson(or had
riged it so that it did not run).

A reasonable extension for the -find- command, and one which
has been discussed briefly in the past, is the capability of
-find-ing an object which is not necessarily "=" to the de-
sired target. For example, one might wish to -find- a var-
iable which is "¬=" to 0, or a value that is "¬<" to a certain
specified value. I would like to propose the following for-
mat for such a command:

findr object,relation,start,length,return[,increment,mask]

where object, start, length, etc. are the same as in the
current implementation of -find-. The "relation" field
could be a comparison operator, such as =, <, or ¬=; OR it
could be an integer constant or variable with a value to
specify the type of match, like:

        relation: 0 => "="? 1 => "¬="? 2 => "<" and so forth...
?(continued)

---------- response 1
  04/05/76     20.42     frye       mfl

All of the relational operators could, I suppose, be in-
cluded in this list, even $and$ and $or$... I personally
would find this command useful in

   1) table searches for "undesired" entries
   2) ranking of students by score, name, or class

where the size of the table or data base can get very large.
There are no doubt even better places to use this! This
seems to be a not-too-difficult and reasonable extension of
the current capabilities of the system -find-.

Any takers?

       I do like the idea of allowing integer tags to se-

that the way the -find- command is currently implemented
(directly into machine code) would make this rather diffi-
cult. Some of the "hard-wired" operators, such as ¬=,<,and >
would require the change of a mere few bits in the
generated code!

note I would kill the stuff I had already saved, so I
IS'd the saved note(¬$1) into my lesson and returned to
reading my notes. I then went to the other note I had
wanted to save previously and pressed SHIFT-'S'. I

    The Append option has been suggested before, by me

notes is so small that it could not even save two notes if
they were both long. Until this problem can be corrected
the append option would not be very useful.

If you enter the common editor by editting the block

are correct:

You may copy if the change, inspect, or common codewords
on the lesson that you are copying from are blank.

You may copy if the change code of the lesson to be copied
from matches the change code of the lesson you are copying
to.

You may copy if the common code on the other lesson matches
the common code on the lesson that you are copying to.

If you make a mistake in setting the mode of a
record (e.g., to student instead of instructor), how
do you change this mode without having first to
destroy the record? It is easy to incorrectly set the
mode when you are inserting a whole series of names at
once.
It seems to me that a feature is needed to change the
mode of a record while you are in the record as before.
I am not suggesting that we should get rid of the new method
of designating the mode.

length restriction?!

Question: Does common have to be locked to prevent two
people attempting to sort at the same time, or is that
automatic? Additionally, is it safe for someone to even
READ common while it is being sorted, or is the sort done
entirely in system workspace and chunked down over the

fortner/p:
What if you are attempting to sort on two bub-fields within
a major field, with say a third sub-field between?
Like this:
major field
sf1¬Isf2¬Isf3¬I

111 101 100 $$record 1
110 111 101 $$record 2

110 000 111 $$record 3

with the $mask$ option, we could mask out the middle 3 bits,
and sort with respect to fields one and three, producing
order = 2,3,1. without masking, we are reduced to doing
_three_ sorts, one on subfield one, two on subfield three, to
get the order desired. if sub-field ordering is important,
for 8 different "1st" fields, you would have to do 8 sorts
on the third field to attain your ordering. with the $mask$
option, you could get automatic sub-field ordering within
the major field in _one_ sort.
That's why.

I've been having some strange things happening to a lesson

double lines across the bottoms of the shifted characters.
Second I notice that the lesson is using a block of common
in spite of the fact that there are no common commands in
the lesson. A little testing has shown that the common only
shows up after the charsets have been loaded. Coincidence,
or some cruel game by the systems people?

It is a cruel (non-)joke. You will be charged for
charsets, linesets, and micros. The charge is reflected
in the "common" portion of ECS charges.

The charset charge will be a "temporary" charge, since
the charset loads once and then is done. I don't know
how that is going to be managed!

        It means that they are in ECS during the time
you use them. Charsets are not kept in, as far as I
know, since the load is a one-time thing, and do not
encompass the translation tables / point tables involved
in the software-generated micros / linechars.

I was loading three charsets and a lineset together.

Now that linesets are being charged for many people will go
back to using rdraws if they only need a few drawings. For
the sake of fairness to authors who created linsets asuming
that there would be no ECS charge, an option should be
provided to convert linechars to rdraws. In fact this option
should have been provided before ECS charges were made for
linesets.

When someone tries to call you via 'TALK', it would be nice
to have the terminal emit a string of "beeps" somewhat

of the recipient to the fact that he is being paged.

This might be useful if you were going to be away from
your terminal, but....
     As long as we're on the subject of term-talk-, I'd like
to mention a point that I brought up awhile back, and never
did recieve a statisfactory reply to. When a person who is
paging you ends the page. the line tells you "end of talk".
HOWEVER! If _another_ person pages you, their name is written
over the previous one, BUT the "end of talk" message remains
at the end of the line. Therefore, someone could be paging
you, and you wouldn't know it--would just figure to call
them back later. (This usually happens while editing, and
the screen hasn't re-plotted). Can something be done about
a full-line erase here? Or do the advantages out-weigh the
disadvantages?

Mr. Browne:

There is one very pressing reason why your suggestion
can't be implemented.

Doing such things requires the sending of an "external"
command. If this were to be done by the system, it could
inadvertantly change the state of some external hardware
device left on the terminal.

I hope it is never done for this reason. After all,
you have no way of knowing what damage you could
be causing by paging my terminal, if the system
sent an EXT signal to me!

This feature has been suggested before, as well as a

user option to turn such a feature on or off jus like
the talk options can be turned off right now. In fact,
this would be even more flexible if one could specify
the actual -ext- value to be sent. I suspect the reason
this has not been implemented yet is that few people have
a program control beeper and systems programmers have
more important and of-general-interest things to do.

On the other hand, can you imagine a classroom with lots

Dave Frye's response is almost correct and displays a
common misconception. The beeper in the touch panel is
not controllable from the central machine. The beeper
however is NOT triggered when you touch the panel, ONLY
when a logic signal, DATA RESUME is sent back to the
touch unit by the terminal. Hopefully, on future terminals
this design error will be corrected. There ARE non-beep
touch panel applications, such as adaptive cursors, as
well as some applications where it would be nice to beep
independent of touch.

Note that there is no objection to the design of the

One generally connects an external hardware device to a
terminal, rather than a specific record. Therefore, it
would seem more logical to make the EXTERNAL option on
the user "info" page a station option rather than a
"user" option.

Especially now that one can no longer send externals to
student or multiple records outside of the lesson that
sends the externals, this option is necessary.

It could be included as an option from the "version"
page, and could reset to "off" when the terminal went
back to "press NEXT to begin". An advantage of having
the option on the "version" page is that authors could
then change the option for a station without signing
off.

Nievergelt, Wilcox, and I have all been involved in a CAI
project, and several MS and PhD theses have been written in
our department. Some of the areas of interest are:
interactive compilers, artificial intelligence, new CAI
languages, generative exam systems, and my own interests
in evaluation and validation of CAI. Whether you call this
a program or not is probably just a semantic question.

this is very different from author to author, but is there

on the average, author's spend 10 minutes editing a
lesson then condense it and try it out 10 minutes...etc.
this means about 3 condenses an hour...

an average author uses 2 TIPS while working...
which adds up t0 7.2 seconds per hour of central processor
time...

an average condense takes about 2 seconds...so
2 ? 3 = 6 seconds per hour of central processor time...

so, an author uses about twice the amount of central
processor than a non-author...half for condensing and
half for everything else...isn't that interesting!

How about some sort (hehehe) of -merge- or -insort- command?

¬?ˆI found that the -sort- is pretty fast.
I had first thought that -sort- should take full
advantage of the fact that the info may be in order.
I found that a sort of 322 random numbers took .074 seconds
resorting the same list after being ordered took .034
seconds. Calcing nc(n1)?nc(323-n1) for a common block
took .022 seconds.

I wonder how this would compair with merge/sort methods?
Would taking advantage of the possible ordering of the
list be important? With merge/sort methods the adding of
one or a few names to the end of list and doing a -sort-
could be very fast.

-merge- could be useful for adding single names wouldn't it?
Or should this be done with a -sort- useing merge/sort
methods?

Merging has use other places. In transfering gnotes from
file to file is an example.??John (after inspiration of listening to bowery)

What these people were asking for, I believe, is an
on-line reference on this subject. Finally, Mike Berger
did what no one else could, and referred them to lesson
'sorting', which took him about 2 lines to type. This was
not a difficult process for him to do, and I am sure that
this type of information was what was wanted. I doubt that
anyone expected anyone else to write a lengthy p-note, but
maybe, just maybe, someone might take the time to enlighten
the entire PLATO community in general notes, rather than
chastise them.

  04/07/76     02.57     luke       cornell

       For a long time now, I have been wanting to write
a little unit that would jump to any unit-name I desire,
just by giving the name.
       I would _love_ a jump with a variable unit tag using
a variable name. Either the present -jump- could be
rewritten, or a new command could be added to facilitate
this; thus, -jumpv-
c ---
jumpv (n1)
jumpv (mainu) $$ jumps to main unit using system variable
jumpv (baseu) $$ jumps to base unit
jumpv n1,(neg1),(zilch),(one),(too),(etc)
c ---
      I believe this has a number of exciting uses--
especially for being able to jump to the main or base
units; or at least in bebugging where going through the
lesson hundreds of times gets to be a bit tedious.
Lets hear it--systems? people?

It would indeed be nice to be able to do a -jump (n1)-
but, as you say, this is not a part of TUTOR. What IS
a part of the language is

jumpout abcde,(n1) $$ abcde is the lesson you are
* currently in

NOTES:
  1) This kind of -jumpout- does NOT execute your i.e.u.
  2) This -jumpout- also does NOT clear your base unit
     (that is, if you TERM or HELP or some such to the
      unit that does the -jumpout-, pressing BACK after
      jumping out will take you to the unit you TERMed
      or HELPed from, unless you do a -base q-).

command.

Rick is correct, you can do a
jumpout samelesson,(unitname)
Keep in mind, tho, that this is expensive!

For debugging, -term-s are marvelous, but they do tend to
foul up the base unit.

Another easy scheme is to make a unit like this:
unit  testit $$ this will do your -jump-s and also
term  testit $$ keep your base unit untangled.

       I tried the command, and it is really sloppy to
do. For instance, if you have a unit that does a
-jumpout return- then you return to the very same unit.
       The kind of checking required for this must be
phenomenal. Perhaps the -jump- command could be changed
to be consistant with the -jumpout- features?
       Also, we might add a parameter as a unit to
jump to if the unit named was not found.

       I really think this could have more uses than
simply de-bugging.

The question of variable unit names is one that has come up
before. Some systems person (Tenczar?) said it would be
possible to have variable unit names as a TUTOR feature,
but that it would be a long time before it was implemented.

I imagine there would be some sort of special construct
to indicate variable unitnames:

goto n1,unita,unitb,¬[variable¬],unitc

or something.

arrow  1010
write  ¬0at,910¬1What unit?
match  n1,unita,unitb,unitc,this,that,those
jump   n1,jumpunit,unita,unitb,unitc,this,that,those

Which has the aditional value over -jump n1- that you
can have it jump only to main units and not to various
computational units which make sense only if -do-ne.

The variable jump reqires an implicit match anyway, and
this one is simple enough. If a way is ever decided on
to initiate judging without an -arrow-, then this will have
all the power of a variable -jump-.

A 10 second test (while writing this reply) shows that the
square key accesses whichever buffer was last accessed,
either EDIT or COPY?

Yes, as I recall, there used to be a problem with this, but
somewhere, back a year or so, (maybe only a few months, but
definitely not in archive general notes) a systems person
said that this had been corrected and that SQUARE took keys
from whichever key, COPY or EDIT, was last pressed.

Correct?

Right Eric. Original implementation used the COPY
buffer till it was empty, then the edit buffer. It
currently uses whatever buffer was last used.

From the ADCIS newsletter March '76 rec'd today...
The ADCIS Conference is designed to provide a setting for
both formal and informal sharing of CAI experience, research
findings, operational notes, educational strategies, and
other developments regarding CAI and CMI. Academic,
commercial, and government groups are invited to come and
discuss their experiences, policies, and potential ways in
which the field of computer-based education can be advanced.

Topic presentation - 20 min presentation, 10 min discussion
Typed abstract of no more than 3 pages must be submitted
no later than April 26, l976.

As to meaning of 'Implementation'...Within ADCIS there
are a number of special-interest groups, Health Science,
Health Education, Education of the Deaf, Elem./secondary/
Jr. College, and Implementation. The latter group has
three sub-groups, Course-Writer, PLATO, and Mini. At the
conferences, these groups hold both business meetings and
special sessions.
At the January conference, I was asked to chair the informal
meeting of the PLATO users group in the absence of the
chairperson. This was an informal discussion relating
mainly to proposed CDC systems and the availability of
courseware. There were no paper presentations at the
conference regarding projects on PLATO. I hope there
will be some at the August conference.
I also hope that this answers your question.

  04/07/76     13.58     d zweig       iu

    When it comes to making graphs ¬+ such PLATO is
an artist. PLATO uses, at least for the -labelx- and
-labely- commands, its athetic 'eye' to make your requests
appear "better" than you might actually request. This is ok,
I like having a machine "watch out for my little slip-ups",
but what disappoints me is that PLATO will not let you
"do it your way", even if you insist.
   An example: (this places y-axis too far left for PLATO)
origin  32,176
axes    448,228
scalex  1975,1929
scaley  10
labelx  5
labely  2,1
   What I would like to suggest is that a new tag
be added to -labelx- and -labely- which would indicate
to PLATO...."betta do it de way de boss sez"...
   (Presently, the only way I know around the problem
is to use a -marky- rather than a -labely- and then -write-
in your own labels.)

Is it intentional that pressing BACK from a helpop within
a helpop returns to original unit and not the first helpop
unit? (All helpop units with arrows.) Ending the unit
normally also returns to the original unit. It would be
nice if it went back one step at a time, but I can see that
it might not be possible.

---------- response 1
  04/07/76     16.16     dyer       meduser

Yes, presumably to make -helpop- consistent with -help-.
Of course, nested -helpop-s with arrows are(probably)
highly individualised so one could merely -jump- back
to the preceding -helpop- unit(messy)...

I would like to see the helpop return one level at a time.
If -helpops- would exit one level at a time I would save
a lot of messy code. Especially when the helpop unit has
an arrow.

         Unfortunately, only one pointer back to the base
unit is kept, so this sort of nesting structure is not
currently possible. I suppose this could be changed in
the future, but it would make the internal structure of
TUTOR more complex.

         For the present, you can set the base pointer in
each helpop unit to the previous level with the -baseu-
command.

---------- response 4

1) There is no -baseu- command. You must mean the -base-
  command.

2)The -base- command only sets the back pointer for the
  current _help_ sequence. It has no effect on _helpop_
  sequences. Please see "aids".

In the system router when one uses an:

Why does the message have to say "You have completed
all of your assigned lessons" and then just sit there.
When students who are unfamiliar with Plato see that
they get up and leave the terminal. Couldn't it say
"Press Next." Or is there some way I can sign the
student off without him having to press shift-stop
or some other confusing method.

This isn't a function of -end lesson-. To get this
message, you must have assigned the student to an
individual sequence, and specified that he should not
be able to go anywhere when the sequence is completed.

(I'll add a comment about SHIFT-STOP.)

Broadus, you are not helping the situation any.

Animation is officially frowned upon in Public Notes, and
for that matter in many group notes files. These files
(and their archives) will some day soon be printed, and
animation makes a printout into a joke.

A long time ago, we were told to cease and desist from
animation in Public Notes. or the system may be forced
to make it impossible.

If they make it impossible in here, it will be impossible
in "pad", too, since "pad" uses the same driver.

Thus we would appreciate it if you refrained from doing
animation in Public Notes.

Has someone just changed the action of the copy key at the
systems level?
The change is for the better. Before, encountering an o0 in
a line of text (common¬Dsource) would stop the copy action.
Now it seems to insert a long string of o55 where the o0
was and allow the copy to continue.
Example o01020300010002000003 (abc¬oa¬ob¬o¬oc) (¬o=o00)
in common converted to source and then in replace mode
attempting to use the copy key yields
abc_____¬o¬o (_=o55 ¬o=o00)

Found out that SHIFT COPY also exhibits this new "filler"
action but it takes more than 1 press of copy1 to get to
the end of the text line that has those nasty o00's in it.

---------- response 2
  04/08/76     21.32     koning       csstaff

Some experimenting reveals that COPY does not stop on a
single o00 but requires at least 2 in a row. One would
presume this is one of the reasons why _two_ o00s are
required as the end of line delimiter in the Tutor editor.

---------- response 3
  04/09/76     09.25     jmk       pso

I don't know if it is a permanent feature, but an o00
character in the copy buffer currently indicates that the
next 6 bits are to be interpreted as the length of a string
of blanks to be inserted.
For example, if the string o0102 0304 0005 0607 1011
occurs in the copy buffer, it will produce the string
         abcd fghi

Two o00 characters in a row signal the end of the copy
buffer. This is independent of the fact that 12 0-bits
at the end of a word indicate the end of a TUTOR line.

This action of the COPY key will probably remain, but
is very definately not a Tutor feature, it is just
something that happenes to work. It was put in to allow
the COPY key to work while editing something known
locally as a Scope Squoze File. Multiple blanks are
stored in this packed format to reduce file size.

By the way, the number of blanks is one more than
the number following the o00.

The system staff might think about taking stats on the

them in lesson "crash" as the ¬l parameter (Poisson) or
perhaps graphic information which would be more easily
understood and contain more information.

Further, this information could be made dynamically
available to a psuedo terminal which could allert hardware
personel in the event of a large-scale loss of transmission
integrity, giving information as to location(s), ¬l, etc...

We have been living with static problems for 2 years.
Since our plato room has both a carpet and a year-round
air conditionner, there is no way we can avoid static
shock.

To avoid the problems of static, we have had our terminals
modified so that you only have to press the red error switch
and white clear switch to unfreeze the terminal. (Your
maintence person can easily perform the conversion.)

We also spray our carpet with a commercial anti-static
fluid once every month or two during the winter, less
often during the summer. One quart of Staticide covers
up to 500 square feet and cost $5.

As for damaging the terminal, I have never heard of

Grounding the terminal doesn't help. The problem is
that static charges don't always seek a ground. Sometimes
they manage to hit a circuit that is above or below ground.

Pressing the white and red clear switches has always cleared
up the problem. Unfortunately (1), the students don't know
that, and (2), it makes the student lose his display.

I can't document any terminals damaged as a result of
the static charges, but one should always keep in mind that
thousands of volts maliciously applied to a terminal can't
be good for it! We HAVE run through a number of RAM cards
at the language lab. This might be one of the reasons.
Incidentally, the character set is the first to go when
a static charge hits our terminals.

        Extensive "exposure" to a particular display does
indeed permanently affect the panel. If you try this with
a terminal used extensively for editing, you will see that
the top line of the block display has etched itself into
the screen. As far as I know, no real damage is done.

        The "Press NEXT to begin" is not replotted every
few minutes. If a terminal is left on the "Welcome to
PLATO" page, it will be backed out to the "Press NEXT" page
after about five minutes. The position of the message
on that page is, I believe, randomized over a few dots--I
know the top line in the editor use to be. Anyway, after
fifteen minutes or so, the "Press NEXT" message is erased.

And another thing is, the system" of course, sends the
terminal back to the press next page from the welcome
page, but the terminal itself erases the screen if it
does not recieve any input in a certain amount of time.

This, I believe, is why the system must send that space
to the lower right hand corner of the terminal every so
often when you are signed in.

The newer panels are supposedly not going to need this
automatic erasing.

The timing is approximately five minutes for terminals
numbered 263 and below, and approximately 30 minutes
for terminals above 263 (i.e. the newer terminals). It
is also suggested that one not fill up (orange out) the
entire screen, as this too has deleterious effects on
the terminal (especially the power supply feeding the
screen).

The writing approximately a little less than five minutes
is indeed to keep a terminal from self erasing itself.
Before this option was installed, one would be working
in the editor or reading a note and copying down some
of the ideas, to find the screen erase! Then, one would
have to replot it...

However, I HAVE seen some graphics demonstrations that do

perhaps by tomorrow we should have a definitive answer

        In any case, I have seen panels with their glass
shattered because the screen "flooded" because of hardware
failure. It was surmised that it took 30+ or so minutes
for the wires to heat the glass enough to shatter it.
I recall that Tony, the master repairman, said that it'd
be okay to turn all the dots on for a minute or so, but
no longer, unless you want to risk thermal overload some-
where in the panel or the supply. Hardware, where are
you?
        Perhaps we have hit upon a means to check what
terminals are _really_ used for. (now watch the game writers

I talked to Tony, terminal maintaineur extraordinaire, and
he said that turning on all the dots is in fact good for
the panel (because it burns dots into the screen evenly)
as long as you don't leave it that way too long.
"too long" turns out to be a relative thing, but his
notion was that an hour or so was a reasonable upper
limit. Factors such as ambient temperature vary the
tendency of the panel to shatter. There is also the
possibility that turning on the whole screen is hard on
the power supply in old terminals.

        The above code would use either lists or arrays,?according to value of 'nutz', without extra overhead.
        It would be possible to have several -ccstop/start-
sequences interleaving thruout a lesson; since the tag to
a conditional condensation directive is an expression, these
sequences can be mutually sensitive.
        This would enormously facilitate pooling of routines
by author-groups thru -use-.
        I think that the required changes to the condensor
should be almost trivial (since nothing new needs to be
remembered during condensation), and cannot think of any
way this could jeopardise system integrity.

Another thing that is interesting about this idea is that
-use- code for lessons could be allowed to change based
on the values of defined constants. This would allow
an author to format more flexible code that is adaptable
to many lessons through the simple change of these defined
constants. Another important advantage is the fact that
only the code that is needed is condensed which may save
on precious ECS.

You are correct, parker. It can be VERY useful.
In B6700 ALGOL, you may set up your own compiler options
as follows:

$SET BUGFIND creates a compiler option called BUGFIND
and turns it on.
$POP BUGFIND turns the option off.

I recently wrote a routine in ALGOL which other
programmers could -use-. (It simulates the EVAL functin
in SNOBOL.) If the -use-r wanted to have predefined
constants available, he would say:

$SET  CONSTANTS
use      eval

If he wanted predefined variables, he would say:

$SET  VARIABLES
use      eval

Inside my code, of course, I had a bunch of
$SET OMIT=NOT VARIABLES and
$SET OMIT=NOT CONSTANTS to give the -use-r just that
subset of the features that he needed.

---------- response 11
  04/10/76     20.32     david       hebrew

It should be clear that there is no conflict between
two -use-rs of this code who want different options;
the appropriate text is inserted into their lesson
only; as with the normal -use- command there will be
two versions of the condensed code when both lessons
are around.

I should also point out here that the option names
(such as CONSTANTS) have absolutely no relation to any
declarations made within the actual code itself; they
are merely "option names" which control how the
compiler will look at text, and these names disappear
after compilation is done.

In short, the idea is sound, it does work, and
provides you with an unbelievable wealth of power when
you want to provide -use-able routines.

An other approach used in CSP/30 FORTRAN:
(the CSP/30 is a 'minicomputer' with a 16 bit word
and a 120 nanosec. instruction time, weird machine).

Lines may begin with a blank or digit in which case
they are always compiled.

They may begin with A,B,C, ...Z, in which they are
compiled conditionally. The C option is normally
turned off so that comments are not compiled, and
the other letters are free to be used for conditional
compilation.

$on A,B  $$to turn on compilation of lines marked A or B
$off A,C $$to turn off compilation of comments and A
A 120 ... $$this line will only be compiled if A is on

So again, we see that the idea is not really new to
higher level languages (being ancient in assemblers).

Todd--this is NOT absurd. Consider: You have a long
and complicated sequence in your lesson, in which you
have inserted a great deal of debugging code. If we
can "bracket" all the debugging code with a pair of

$SET    OMIT=NOT DEBUG
$POP    OMIT

then a normal condense will condense everything but the
debugging code. If the lesson ever goes wrong (and it
will), all you need do is insert this at the top of your
lesson:

$SET  DEBUG

and recondense--your debugging code will "come back".
When the lesson is repaired, remove the $SET DEBUG
and recondense--the lesson is back to normal. This seems
far easier than putting "*"s on all the debugging code
and removing them later. (Ever had to do that?!)

        I'll have to excuse myself for saying that the
original suggestion was absurd. What I should have said
was that the discussion that followed ranged from fair to
inane. Who cares how conditional compilations or assemblies
are done on other machines? Something along this line
would be nice but I think the systems software staff is
completely capable of implementing an adequate method for
allowing this (certainly not with anything other than
defined CONSTANTS inside the lesson.)

I have strong reservations about conditional -stop-s and
-start-s. We had conditional condensing on Plato 3,
largely because of the extremely limited amount of disk
space.
It was a dreadful headache! If you want to condense in or
out large chunks, you might as well have two lessons, or
do partial condenses. If you are planning to include/
exclude small chunks, forget it! It is not worth the
bother!

A more severe limitation: I don't think the system could
support "variable" condenses. We have trouble enough
getting ECS when there is only ONE version of a lesson,
let along 14! And there would be tremendous overhead
involved in deciding which of 14 versions should be
entered,deleted, etc.etc.

I hate to sound like George Carter, but...

Throughout its history, this system has progressed almost
solely through the efforts of various courseware groups
and concerned individuals to GET the commands and options
they needed to design everything from highly structured
courseware to fast games. They have stuck with PLATO for
two reasons: 1) there was nothing else comparable, and
2) the possibilities of expansion were endless. If Mr.
Little is going to speak for the systems staff, or even
for himself, he'll have to remember the rest of us, some
of which actually want or need the feature requested. We
have even volunteered to write such features ourselves, in
some cases! Of course, there are important things to be
done, but to downgrade this type of request for that reason
is irresponsible.??A hardened veteran,

Also, in answer to Judy, the quickest answer I can come up
with is -- if you don't like conditional condensing, you
don't have to use it (with due respect, of course)! And
I would think that there could exist at any one time only
ONE version of a lesson...namely, the last one condensed,
by whatever method. Sorry if I sounded stuffy back there

It seems that everyone has now come to a sensible solution.
That is, one should be able to cause an extensive change in
the condensed code of a lesson with only a small change in
the editor. I do this all the time. Just locate all of the
conditionally condensed code in units in blocks separate
from the always condensed code. Then -do- the conditional
units wherever they are needed among the constant code.
which reference units within them will cause condense errors
but will not be condensed.

How come I never got 23 replys when I suggested this?

It definitely would be useful, mainly for -use-d code, so
there wouldn't be any problem there with multiple binaries.
And obviously there will only be one version of a lesson
condensed at any one time, so the conditions that exist
at condense time are going to determine what users get
even if they enter later (in answer to judy.)

The last time I brought this up, systems said it was
possible and would be done someday, but it was low
priority (natch). But how about a system comment on whether
system variables such as tactive or mallot could be accesed
at condense time? It would be very useful if possible.

---------- response 25
  04/12/76     16.04     white       p

No, variables could not be accessed at condense time,
neither system defined variables or user variables.

Also, the expressions that could be used would be fairly
limited for a while. Very few functions are evaluated
at condense time.

Yes, this has been talked about on the system level,
and personally, I think it should be added to Tutor.

---------- response 26
  04/12/76     17.34     travers       mxc

I was under the impression that the condesor reduced all
constant expressions to single constants in defines and
other expressions. I don't quite understand why it couldn't
do it in a -cstop- also.

I realize there must be difficulties in accessing system
variables at condense time, but maybe there could be some
special tags for prime-time or ecs crunch situations. Such
a capability would take some strain off system resources by
not condensing a primetime-restricted game if someone tries
to enter it during primetime (as an example). I don't really
know how difficult this would be, but I think it would be
tremendously useful.

        In reply to Judy's objection, proliferation of
binaries:
        If it seems necessary, this kind of option could be confined to -used- code; and whenever a -ccstart- or
-ccstop- is encountered in a 'main lesson' (non-use-d), it
would be condensed either as a comment or as the corres-
ponding unconditional directive, whichever seems most
logical (almost certainly the former default: all
'conditionally-condensed' code being condensed).

Thank you, Dave (Frye). I agree with the Frye viewpoint
and see nothing wrong with his response, either in
substance or style. Conferencing is obviously a valuable
tool for compiling lists of alternative implementations.

If the "switches" alternative was listed, I missed it.
In RT-11 Fortran one can specify a 'd' switch which will
compile debug code(those lines beginning with a 'd'
,clearly TUTOR would require a special character) by
a '/d' specified during the compile command string.
I submit this simply as another alternative, and have
not thought through the merits of all methods. and have
discussion proves is that PLATO has little use for Jean
Sammett's well known book, 'Programming Languages' since
users willing supply dozens of past implementations; more
I am sure that Ms. Sammett compiled in her classic book.

        The GNOTES system allows you 100 words maximum
when writing a note....but when the note is stored, the
amount of space available becomes equal to the actual
size of the note as soon as anyone writes anything after
it(note, or response to any note). So, when you used 3 words
you got 3 words and no more! To do otherwise would mean
juggling everyone's notes around that come after yours.

my understanding is that the erase command is changed by the
size command, that is it tries to erase an ammount that
corresponds to the space used by text in the current size.

This makes sense even, consider a unit that will erase
a nice rectangular space for a message (best done with
the erase command!) and then write that message; I think
most users will agree that the unit should work no matter
what -size- is in effect when the unit is -do-ne.

It does indeed seem strange. For -size- smaller than .281247
when trying to erase 2 characters it will erase _63_ spaces.
For -size- smaller than .562497 when trying to erase 1 char
it will also erase _63_ full characters.

It may be that this is a known bug which is just ignored or
it may be due to the present version. The only case that I
can see it being a problem in is the one of size=.5 when
ersing one character. Most of the other cases would not
be used because of speed or readability.

Of course, above the given sizes erase works as stated.

About the hung terminals due to static electricity,
mentioned in "phenomenon" (note 250)...isn't this the
solution(?):

Two of our terminals OFTEN got hung up after a spark. We
had heard that the standard remedy is to make sure the
keyset casing makes contact with the screws, presumably
for grounding purposes. ("Scrape off some paint.")

BUT this had no effect. Apparently, whatever inside the
keyset is supposed to be grounded _isn't_.

So we externally (with a wire) connected the keyset casing
to the terminal's casing, which _is_ grounded.

This worked absolutely. Static discharges are ignored,
and the terminals haven't been hung ever since. You must
ground the keyset (sellers said "externals"), not just
the terminal itself. ¬???==??Dan===¬=I=['="]=ˆˆ_

And, for the sake of safety, make sure that the terminal
itself is grounded. The installation people have found
many cases where a 3-pronged wall socket did not have
the "ground" actually grounded (even in new buildings).
Unless the socket is grounded, a 3-prong plug on the
terminal is no help. If you don't have grounded outlets,
get someone to provide an independent ground for your
terminal.

The terminals are UL approved, but that doesn't help much
if they are installed in a non-code wired building (i.e.
one that doesn't have its "grounded" outlets grounded)
or uses outlets which are so worn that the ground is poor.
This is a real problem in hospitals (according to the
safety engineering literature) since many of the UL approved
outlets fail to maintain good contact after a bit of wear.
It's bad enough to be zapped by your terminal but when your
heart-lung machine lets you down.....

Either Double Ought (heavy duty ground wire for the safety
minded person) or a more reasonable grounding strap (av-
ailable at most amateur radio shops) should provide a
good ground. Be sure that what you are grounding to, IS
a good ground! Dont hook into a lightning pole grounding
strap or into electrical pipes. Good grounds are best
made by running your own...

1. Terminals with the newer keysets give the most shocks.
2. One can loop some bell wire around the phillips screw
nearest the opening for the line going back to the
terminal, and loop the other end of the wire around one
of the screws on the plug on the other end of the line.
This seems to solve the problem, without adding to the
problems of connecting and disconnecting the keysets.
The wire can be wound around the data line, so that it
isn't a bother.

---------- note 355 touch mess
  04/11/76     23.52     clark       lawyer

We just got our touch panel recently and so I of
course went through aids to find out the different
"touch-related" commands. WHAT A MESS!! For the -touch-
command, the format is: (1) co-ordinates of touch (2) a
comma (3) x-boxes long (4) a comma (5) y-boxes high.
For "touch" in -keytype-: (1) co-ordinates of touch
(2) a semi-colon (3) x-chars long (4) a comma (5) y-lines
high.

Will these two (and any others which I missed) ever be
consistent? It would seem that they should be consistent
for ease in use. I think the format for -keytype- is
more workable myself. Any comments from other touch users?

The reason stated for the difference in the -keytype-
tags was that many users didn't like the touch area tags,
and the keytype tags represented an alternative, based on
the dimensions of the screen rather than the characteristics
of the panel. I happen to like the keytype approach

---------- response 3
  04/12/76     11.43     judy       pso

We quite agree! -touch- is a mess, and it is certainly
partially due to the evolutionary growth of the system.

A contributing problem was that touch panels were once
so scarce that there were almost none available for
use by the systems people--so they neither observed nor
understood the problems.

Often suggestions for new commands are received with
cynicism--as you surely have noted! Here is an area
where good suggestions are needed. What kinds of touch
commands would make programming easier for _you_/

---------- response 4
  04/12/76     13.03     clark       lawyer

There would be two formats which I think would be very
workable: (1) use a 16?16 grid and make tolerances in
what would be boxes (2) use regular coarse grid and have
PLATO convert it to the nearest touch area (tolerance
in chars and lines).

One advantage of (1) is that it gives easy and exact
reference to the touch-grid. This would be very easy
for new authors to learn. An advantage to (2) is that
it makes it very easy to use variables in the touch
command without having to worry about the "n?4+1" formula
currently in AIDS.

I prefer (2) myself.

Comments from other users?

ALSO, will it ever be possible to eliminate the
enable command? PLATO could automatically enable the
touch panel with any touch, or keys=touch command(??)

As is noted in the aids writeup of the -pause- command,
a "pause keys=touch" enables the touch panel (and
disables it after you touch the screen). This is a
fairly recent improvement to TUTOR, so don't feel badly
if you missed it!

---------- response 6
  04/12/76     14.18     clark       lawyer

I had not missed it, my point is that you still need
to -enable- for a -touch- or -touchw- command? Will
this always be necessary (maybe there is a use for
this that I don't see)?

---------- response 7
  04/12/76     15.08     larry north       ve

You need the enable after arrow and before the judging
commands because:

1) The arrow disables the touch panel.

2) The touch and touchw commands are not executed until
   after judging is initiated. Touch input cannot initiate
   judging unless the panel is enabled.

Ii would be nice if we could obtain the mirror image of
linedrawn figures. Presently to make the mirror image of
a linecharacter I will have to edit the linechar copying
every point on paper and then will have to make a new line
char inverting either the x or y coordinates. I'm sure this
could be done much easier on a systems level. Since the
arguments of linechars and rdraws are already multiplied by
size and rotate it should be easy to implement, perhaps with
an optional argument on the rotate command or by allowing
negative arguments on the two argument size command. It
would certainly save a lot of work and a lot of disk space.

The "almost full" message is not meant to impart any

warn you that (1) the file needs to be re-initialized

I am site director, but really by default. The site is
untenable since the users' needs, goals, and attitudes are
so very different from place to place and time to time. 
That is why we have advised everyone who could to form
sites of their own.

Untenable in that a "site" like "network" cannot be
maintained on future systems or untenable in that
the users of "network" cannot be defended from
abuse by other members of "network?"

   In talking to elston/rhrc, an author of medical
programs on PLATO, I tried lesson 'pexamg' which contains
approximately 20000 words of ECS. Yet, before you pass
judgement, please talk to one of the "rhrc" group for more 
information.

   My understanding is that, for one, courseware is
being developed to aid physicians diagnose patients right
in their office. Thus, the requirements call for both an
extensive library and rigorous data structure.

   As for the question "why PLATO?", it appears that
as a centralized network, PLATO may provide an effective
communications web among physicians regarding such compu-
terized data handling. Otherwise, other computer systems
would seem more appropriate to me.

The size of a lesson is relevant only with respect to
other users on the same site. If a site is owned by a
group, or dedicated to their purposes, they should be the
sole determiners of what size lessons are used. There
are, in fact, router/lesson combinations that take up far
more than 20,000 words of ECS.

The size of the lesson is not the point, but the decision of
the people in charge who elected to use it while on site
"network".

Maybe PSO should do this as a public service. The tape
can be transcribed, then editted by the speaker, and then
a final copy produced and duplicated (or entered into a
plato file). If hard copy is produced, it should only be
sent to remote sites, not sent to local people too lazy
to attend the lecture (naturally there will be special cases
here). How about it Bill?

  04/13/76     16.02     bowery       comm

Something of use to all individuals using external
devices dependant on PLATO generated output would be a
terminal generated STOP code fed/back to the input line
as if the main computer sent it upon a press of STOP or
STOP1. Something like ext 0(?)

With the special nature of the STOP and STOP1 commands
I think that a special terminal function could be in order.

Users of external devices could make this code CLEAR
or initialize their device so that if a student presses
STOP or STOP1 in the middle of PLATO transmitting info
to the device, it can be easily set up again. This could
solve the problem of output in finish units, which seems
to be a burr in our sysprogs' saddle.

One could be specified by a special command in the lesson,
and if that command were not used, no -ext- would be output:
finext 0 $$ do -ext 1- when stop(1) pressed
Of course this would only work if the ext were generated
by Plato. If you want it to be a terminal function, the
programmable terminals could do this same thing.

   Since we don't have a reasonable length of time to
complete this assignment, we need your help in collecting a 
list of questions likely to be asked. Lesson 'uaq' will
store your questions. With a little help and a good measure

seems necessary NOT to display the questions already asked.

the questions already asked (some have been converted to

I have two complaints about the operation of
Instructor Mode:
1. When one has completed the construction of a student's
personal sequence, the sequence cannot be changed or
edited without destroying the sequence and starting over.
For example, this is frustrating when one wants to add
lessons to an existing sequence.
2. When preparing modules and sequences and one is
making choices from the catalog, if one makes a few
choices, then pressing + does not bring one to the
next page for more choices.

Dunno about the first item, but as to the second, you
can press + followed by NEXT to move forward, can't you?
(Something that should be fixed, of course, but you
can use it as is.)

 I tested pressing the + key then NEXT to advance and
it works as Bruce said. This nuance is a bit frustrating
to instructors even if they are somewhat experienced
with instructor mode because when only looking through the
catalog, you don't need to press NEXT after pressing +.
Glen is rightfully concerned
about making changes in individual sequences, particuarly
additions.

Not to gripe too much, but.........

It seems that the Bulletin Board consistently lags about
a day or so behind announcements of new system features,
policies, etc. Sometimes it is updated immediately,
sometimes it lags more than a day or two. For me, in any
case, this eliminates its usefullness, as a quick check
in sysfeature notes is often more up to date.

I didn't mean to say it had no use. It is a good place for
brief announcements other than new features. My point was
that a new feature usually takes at least a full note to
be understood. The note is going to be written anyway.
It doesn't take any longer to look for the notes.

The question is really one of truth in marketing.

The Bulletin Board should either say:

1. Consult "new system features" for new features
       (and omit the list of features)

or it should say:

2. Below is a one-week-out of date list of new
    features -- for recent additions see new systems
        features.

---------- response 6
  04/14/76     16.26     artman       uimatha

What I meant was that I like to be able to check the
bulletin board to see if there might be anything that I
had not already seen in sysfeature notes, or major
announcements in public notes. I never look at the
bulletin board to see what a new command is about, just
to see if there is anything that I should look at elsewhere.

I thought that that was the bulletin board's purpose, and
the reason it was once part of the signon routine.

   I don't know any reason why people making a new entry
in the system feature notes cannot take 30 seconds to
add a quick one line indication of its existence in
the bulletin board display. Only some of the system
staff seem to want to bother with it (and some others
probably don't know where to go to make the change),
but continued indications of its use may help convince
people to make that extra effort. In the meantime,
many of us do try to keep it current, but you may have

  04/14/76     12.53     nudelman       css

    This is something I have been wondering about for
a while... In aids it says that a time slice is .025
seconds. But simple arithmetic shows that with 350 users,
.025 seconds spent on each one means a gap of 8.75 seconds
between your time slices. So what actually determines
the end of a time slice?

        And a probably related question: does this code:
*
* some code
*
return $$ end the time slice
transfr a,b,100
transfr b,c,100
*
guarantee that the 2 -transfr-s will be executed in the
same time slice?

      * Mark Nudelman *

---------- response 1
  04/14/76     13.06     woolley       p

Not everyone needs a timeslice every time around, and
of the users that do, few need their full 25 msec. The
end of the timeslice comes when some break in the processing
occurs (end of unit, pause command, etc.) or when autobreak
interrupts you when you have exceeded 25 msec.

No two commands are EVER guaranteed to be executed in the
same timeslice. In fact, sometimes a break will occur
within a single command! However, in your example it is
unlikely that the transfr's will be executed in separate
timeslices.

---------- response 2
  04/14/76     13.08     golden       s

I just looked at today's statistics: The average timeslice
was a little less than 5ms in duration; The average poll
(the list of users waiting to be served) was 26ms. So, on
the average only 5 or 6 users need service each poll.
Even though there are more than 300 users.

Changes made a few months ago give variable length
time-slices. They are never longer than 25ms, but you may
be stopped a lot sooner than that.

2 Questions that require one number each:

Q1: What is the probability that a given PLATO course will
    be more effective than an equivalent conventional one?

Q2: What is the probability that a given PLATO course will
    cost less than an equivalent conventional one?

I'm aware that the database is pretty small but I would 
like what information you have anyway.

Some more questions:
1)How is effectivness measured?
2)How is cost measured?

A given implementation of PLATO, given appropriate use of 
its features (see reply to previous note), may be designed
to give (a)higher performance on same objectives,(b) same
level of performance on more material,(c)higher level of 
understanding on same material, (d) more positive student
attitude toward the subject.....
  Costs may be in terms of monitary input, student time, 
instructor time, etc. as well as trade-offs among these.
  Documentation of major aspects of these considerations
is being prepared as part of the internal evaluation of 
PLATO and will be available some months in the future.
Meanwhile, the PLATO publications list is the best source
of info. But remember, it ain't simple.......
    (so much for the effectiveness of that grammer lessons..)

In general I have found that educators and people in 
acedemia choose to look on grades as the indicator of 
effectiveness. I asked the question so they could 
understand it with a minimum of argot translation.

I didn't mean to argue about the definition of real 
education. I meant to ask about "education" that is mapped
on to our grading systems to show "effectivness." Whether
that mapping is a useful one is a good question but not
necessarily related to the one I was meant to ask.

ie: How much higher or lower are the "grades" of a student
    taught a subject on PLATO than those of a student
    taught the same subject with conventional methods?

It is a simplistic question that contains little information 
of value to civilization but if one wants good "grades"
one doesn't necessarily ask if something is effective in 
a globalistic sense.

Thanks to the many people who have responded to 'arizona's
request for help (note ¬$478)!!
       The response was so overwhelming that it swamped our 
collection routine in lesson 'uaq'. Had we anticipated the
degree to which the Plato community offers assistance, we
would have allotted additional common for storage of the
questions. Unfortunately, the circular buffer wrapped-
around sometime this morning, overwriting the first 100
questions. We estimate that all questions entered before 
¬;11:00 CST were lost. (SIGH)
        If you were one of the early responders, we apprec-
iate your help this morning, and if you feel inclined to 
re-enter your questions, we promise that the lesson will not
destroy your contributions again.

Thanks,

     I notice that, at least as of this version, a 
-cstop- / -cstart- sequence interrupts a -define- sequence
that it occurs within (that is, the lines after the -cstart-
are not recognized as continuation of the -define- set).

This is indeed a long-standing "error". It will be 
fixed someday, but an easy fix is not available or it would
have been done. Since the problem is just a "nuisance"
it may be a while before it is fixed.

     There are a couple of problems/errors in this general
area; there has been some consideration given to re-doing
the way in which the next line look ahead is done
in the condensor. If and when this is done, presumably
several different things (this problem included) will
get fixed.

     Does anyone out there have a routine for a moving
arrow? That is, the student has a list of variables which
he may alter at will; if he presses next or back without
entering anything at the arrow, the variable in question
is not changed and the arrow moves forward or backward.
If he enters a number, the variable is reset, then the
arrow moves.

the student to move a cursor to the desired location, and
at that point, enter either a single value, or specify
a direction in which he would like to move after each

CONTROL DATA UNVEILS AN EDUCATION COMPUTER
   By William D. Smith
    The Control Data Corporation introduced yesterday a
computer-based education syste, called Plato, that appears
to be the largest and most sophisticated commercial attempt
yet to utilize computer technology in the educational
process.
    The Plato system which uses a large-scale Control
Data Computer, will sell for $5 million to $6 million,
but terminal time will be available for $4 to $10 per
hour.
    William C. Norris, chairman of Control Data, said at a
news conference at the Park Lane Hotel that the corpora-

            Computer Utilization
    The utilization of compter and other advance technol-
ogies was a topic of considerable attention during th
late 1960's and early 1970's, with many major companies such
as the General Electric Company, the RCA Corporation and
the Xerox Corporation going into the z "educational
business." For the most part the anticipated profits were
not forthcoming and the boom became a bust for some of the
entrants into the field.
    A drop in the anticipated rate of school population
growth and a drop in Federal subsidies to education
contributed to the market's failure to live up to
expectations.
    Mr. Norris said that the industry was now a much more
solid base and that the growth in computer-based edu-
education (continued . . . )

"will make possible terminals in employees' homes within a

    This will be the biggest consumer market this country
has ever seen," he said.
    The company will offfer its Plato system in three ways:
    P=¬IThrough a subscription service involving the instal-
lation of terminals in customer facilities with communica-
tion links to the nearest Control Data Plato computer sys-
tem.
    P=¬IThrough a chain of learning centers in major metropol-
itain areas for business and industry training needs.
    P=¬IThrough privately installed computer systems at
customer installations.
    Plato operates through visual display terminals that
connect directly to the large-scale compter and interact
through lesson materials in the computer's memory. Users
see their instructional material in the form of text,

    The student interacts with the computer-stored lesson
materials in some what the same manner as with a teacher --
foloing instructions, asking and answering questions.
    More than 500 users can use a single Plato system
simultaneously, each calling up different materials and
getting respones in less than two-tenths of a second.
    The company will supply course materials, but the sys-
tem has a simplified computer language that will allow
teachers to implement their own specific courses.

CDC stock was really depressed last year when it was selling

depressed. I would think that the brokers would be refering
to some of CDC's other activities. I would not think that
revenues would start coming in all to soon from the invest-
ment that they will have to undertake to do a proper
marketing job of Plato.

When you think about it 10 dallars per hour of computer
usage is not bad but I would think that people would use
the system for other things than teaching just because it

Is there any reason that -course- is a command rather than
a reserved word...such as "user" or "zreturn". I realize
that it is necessary for -name-, since it can be 18 letters.

Also, is there any chance for a system reserved word for a
random number generator...returning a random no. between
0.¬D1. I realize the -randu- command will do this...but this
way would make it neater for random deviate generators.

The course is not given as a reserved word so as to be

I think the system answer shows a foolish consistency.

How about having system reserved words name1, name2, and
course. name1 would give the first 10 letters of the
name and name2 the rest; course would give the course.
Then we would still be consistent.
Look at the defined random number generators in
lesson library (inspect only) -- I think they

-course- -random- and many other commands came into
existence long before there were reserved words in the
TUTOR calc machinery...indeed, even before the calc
machinery was very powerful...it would be a close battle
to see how these options would be implemented today...
there are plus and minus sides to having options as
reserved words / TUTOR commands.
For example, the -calc- is the slowest of all commands
during condense time while commands such as -course-
are the fastest...this is of course counterbalanced by
the fact that one generally wants to use this information
in a -calc- situation...

so, someday when we get some free minutes, we will probably
re-evaluate the whole works...

   The question also tends in its extreme to become
one of just how much "embedding" one wants to take
place--at the farthest end the system could be reduced
to just a -write- command and a -calc- command with
all graphics simply embedded into the write and all
computationally related things embedded into the calc.
The balance point in readability and efficiency is
not always easy to define.

Just noticed a funny thing about a notefile, "accnotes".
I had just finished writing a note, and stored it. I
pressed -BACK-, and of the 4 notes in the file, only the
first 2 appeared, and I never got an "end of notes" message.
I pressed -NEXT-, and got the last 2 notes, and the "end
of notes" message. What I'd like to know, is what happened,
ie, why didn't all the notes appear on 1 page when I pressed
back? (There's only 4 of them in the file). When I "stop1"
out, and came back in, there were all 4 on 1 page, just as
it is supposed to be.

My guess is that you pressed BACK twice. When you back
out to the index, it starts showing notes beginning
with the last one you read. Then when you press back,
it goes back a ways and shows notes until it gets to
one that was displayed on the previous index page.

I have found it very useful when translating from other
computer languages to create a partial converter
consisting of a number of TUTOR units which perform the
functions of those commands in the source language which
have no direct counterparts in TUTOR. For the reasons Judy
suggests, I too have doubts about doing much more,
unless there is a very large number of lessons to covert.

---------- response 3

The $65 figure comes from the experience of the Med group
who used student hourly programmers for converting 56
coursewriter lessons. They also made various changes in
the lessons to make available PLATO capabilities not
expected by the lessons. You don't really want a machine
translation. People will do it so much better for so little
cost.
As a direct answer to your question, I don't think a
converter exists.

*
The "costs" cited were "direct" costs- salary,
travel and such and did not include either hardware
or conventional institutional "overhead". Costs were
divided into two segments-- first that of acquiring
the data-base (conferences with the original owners and
the like), and the initial coding of the driver programs.
*
The second cost component was the cost of actually
converting the modules or the "recurring costs".

The non-recurring costs (setup) were $3470 for 56 modules
or about $67 per module. The production costs were
$5054 for 56 modules or $90 per module. This could have
been cut back further a good bit by doing a literal
translation but instead, each module was carefully
edited by one or more subject content experts and
some of the displays were reconstructed to conform with
applicable PLATO features.
*
On the one hand, the modules do far more on PLATO
than they did on the original version. They are
far faster, more fun to use, and keep much more data.
*
On the other hand, they were produced at less than one
tenth the cost of starting from scratch-- and academic
point anyway if one considers that the originals were
produced by a staff of 18 PhD pharmacologists--

That certainly makes sense in the case of instructional

possibility that the student presses STOP by accident,
and besides many lessons wouldn't make any sense without
the characters loaded. Think of a hebrew lesson without
hebrew characters, for example!
On the other hand, there are no compelling reasons in
most non-instructional lessons to do the same.

Touch Panels tend to "die" when attached to a terminal in
a hot room. This can happen before the terminal starts
suffering from heat stroke. One can observe this by taking
off the hot touch panel, putting a new one on and watching
the new one "die" in 10 or so minutes. The symptoms are
touches being lost or misinterperted.

a change in the jump statement(I _still_ don't know how it

should ask people to leave _Unless_ they have a justifiable

within both 165a and 165b are the terms of the game
playing policy for the two rooms. Among other things,
it states that at least 7 terminals must be empty before
game playing will be allowed, and that "any violation
of the policy will be handled by the operator on duty".
        I completly agree with Mr. Harkrader's methods
of this evening. Students kept arriving to do homework
and found NO empty terminals, let alone the required
7. Repeated requests by the operator were entirely
ignored by many of those playing games, as is the case
quite often after prime time on weekends. The messages
across the bottom of the screen were ignored, students
kept comming to the operator trying to get on the
system, and the natural result followed. The operator

Inhibiting all author signons caused any author wishing

fore-warned about the consequences of playing games
on such a night at this, when there was an exceptionally

would eject anyone playing games. As the room filled once
more, I restricted authors but allowed people who were
editing to remain. I repeated this on-off cycle 3 times.
The change was preceeded by a warning each time.
As we all know, there's a little ritual that gameplayers
go through when I announce the impending restriction: they
all sit around inspecting lessons, re-reading pnotes, term-
talking and reading notes. The terminal crunch continues.
I turn away students. Finally, I go into the classroom and
tell the gameplayers that they must do more than get out
of games, they must leave the room.

    There is a similar crunch here at ISU, where there is
at least one class which, all by its lonesome, can take up
all four terminals, twenty-four hours a day, all quarter.
Since we have no operator here most of the time, it is
necessary for us to watchdog ourselves and each other.
The problem of students who don't know their rights has
come up here, too, and while I personally think the answer
is to tell the students what their rights are, I can't
be sure. It's a pretty problem, and I wish someone had

Someone ought to write a routine that would do this:

1) Find all authors who are in a selected list of games
  (this list would probably have to be revised often).
  (This ought to include students and multiples too, now  that I think of it)
2) Kick them all out
3) Restrict all of their signons

This routine would be used five minutes after a warning
(game-players have remarkably short memories, and would
be game playing by five minutes after the warning).
     I believe that this would be preferable to inhibiting
entire courses (such as uni), when not all members of
these courses are playing games. I enjoy games too, but
I realize that there are limitations, and I only play them
when there are few users (Sunday morning, for example).

Re: the comparison of Al Harkrader to an insane baseball
     umpire

When one is dealing with people who act like insane baseball
(or airfight, trek, moonwar, etc.) players, one may often
get the best possible results by acting like an insane
umpire. While I was not at CERL this weekend, on past
weekends I have observed countless similiar situations,
and I have watched many approaches to the problem. I feel
that Al's is probably the quickest method, and definitely
the method with the most lasting results.

It's interesting to see that the person complaining is in
course "ed". The department of education has 5 terminals.

CERL is extending them a courtesy by allowing their authors
to use CERL terminals. Rather than demanding rights on 
those terminals, the complainer ought to reconsider his
responsibility to those nice enough to let him use their
site - either that, or stay at your own site.

  That attitude is easy when you have 70-80 terminals
available to you 24 hours a day, Berger! As for myself,
I try to follow the rules as much as possible,and there
are clowns who ignore them;however, common courtesy
never hurts;both in the case of authors AND that of

       If we are going to start the bit about common
courtesy again, what about the gamesters being courteous?
Do you call it courtesy to (in effect) refuse to leave
a terminal that is badly needed by a student who may want
to study for a test? That student is paying money for
the privaledge of using PLATO to learn. Yes, money. It's
called tuition. Are those gamesters who are obstinate
and refuse to leave when asked (and lawfully asked) by
the operator on duty being courteous?
        And let me ask this: Were those same gamesters
to show the very same courtesy towards students and
operators which they are herein so loudly demanding,
would they not recieve it? The natural reaction on the
part of any authority when dealing with obstinance is
to finally exert its authority and launch a barrage of
orders. Past experiance has shown the futility of using

You people miss the whole point...I don't challange
the right of the students for terminals nor the right
of the site controller to remove people who aren't
really working. The POINT is that I recieved
NO warning (nor my friend brooks ed). Also the
attitude of the Site Controller on duty should
Include a little more COURTESY if he is to expect some in
return. Students represent a special problem since
they often don't know what to, however there are
signs there that tell them where to get help. If they

  This is a reponse to the student-vs-author-playing-games
conflict at Cerl (or anywhere else for that matter). I
believe the operator handled the situation about as well as
any human could. Plato, after all, is an educational tool
and not just a plaything. Therefore all non-students on the
system have soom responsibility to the students doing plato
lessons. This means, for example, that when student demand
is high, an author should try to get a terminal elsewhere
or get off the system entirely. Last night, the physics
building terminals were restricted to all authors so that
students could work. In instances of high demand, I would
not find this an unreasonable thing to do at Cerl. However,
a more reasonable soltuion would be for the author to devel-
ope a sense of responsibility toward the student. So if an
author sensed that student demand was high, he would sign

off. This would include authors working on programs who
don't have immediate deadlines to meet.
  Rules like the "seven open terminals" rule are needed
because some people fail in their responsibilities to the
student. When this happens there is bound to be some ten-

Mr. Weiss of course ed:
        My suggestion to you is this. Before you make
a further response, I believe that you should re-read
the early responses to this note. First, several and
repeated warnings were given (I myself lost count somewhere
around 5) that game playing WOULD NOT be tolerated, and
second, a SITE CONTROLLER is an inantimate piece of
machinery sitting in a corner, while an OPERATOR is a
human being inhabiting an office directly across the hall
from room 165 CERL.

Mr. Weiss: 
     You claim that you were not warned about games.

        First, you were warned 3 times by signs when you
entered the classroom. Second, I sent frequent messages
to the entire site warning about games. There are a few
problems with site messages; they erase the last 3 lines
of text on the screen which is annoying to students, they
are not displayed if you are doing full screen erases as
when replotting, and they are very time-consuming to send.
Third, as a frequent user of our classroom, I know that
you are aware of our policies. So, if all these efforts
failed to reach you, I most humbly beg your forgiveness.

      One comment on your last response: students do
_not_ represent a special problem. They are the reason for
this educational system. On the contrary, gameplayers
represent a special problem, especially if it is _they_ who 
can't read signs.

It seems as though there is much uneasyness concerning
peoples' attitudes and what part COURTESY plays. I was
the originator of this GAMES note. I was never, never
"warned". I was simply backed out. The fact is that I
was working on the programming of a computer assisted
game of cooperation. I was not playing. The site dir-
ector did not speak to me but without warning backed
me out. In fact after I was barred from use of the
terminal I noted that there were in fact seven term-
inals open from time to time and also that at least
5 individuals were engaged in a game of Michelin.
In the future I would urge all to use a measure of
courtesy. I would have gladly let any student use the
terminal I was occupying. That's what PLATO is for.

I do not frequent CERL frequently (sorry), but it seems
that the problem here is caused by one major factor: the
monitor in the room cannot be expected to always act with
the maximum courtesy because of the amount of time
that such courtesy consumes. I agree that a little
courtesy can go a long way, but there are times when quick
action, rather than amiable reaction, is the only route.

On a system in which there are large numbers of people,
personal attention cannot always be supplied. Perhaps
communicating more with the monitor on a personal level
would be advisable. They are people just like anyone
else and their job is to make your life on PLATO easier:
talk to the monitor, don't yell at the site controller.

Sorry if I offend anyone, but I have always found the
people who operate this system to be helpful and generous.

I hate to tell you this, gameplayers, but you WON'T see

The PLATO operators have many duties which are not held by
any other site monitor. Theirs is the responsibility of
overseeing the smooth operation of the entire system. The
classroom is a relatively small (and frequently irritating
part of the job.

The ops must act with dispatch and without much compassion
when our site here is being misused or is overcrowded.
Scheduled students have first priority at all times,
followed by non-scheduled students. The "offended" parties
are lucky if they were warned of their "doom": when I work
I back out gamers and restrict their courses on the first
offense (almost always without warning)!! We are looser
during non-prime time, but it is up to the user to exercise
responsibiliies implicitly granted with the use of the

Since this is the second incident of this nature to occur
during my shifts, I assume I am doing something wrong. In
the future I will try to be more concerned with warnings
to site abusers. I would not want to be the cause of ill
feelings towards the fine group of people I work with.

But, if I am to put on the sackcloth and ashes, then so
must the gameplayers. The original complainers threw the
word 'courtesy' around with ease, Webster defines it as
cooperation and generosity. If gameplayers had courtesy
for students, there would be no need for monitoring the
classroom or ejecting abusers. Room 165 CERL is a class-
room, not an arcade. I can't believe you weren't aware
of the crunch for terminals when you entered the games.
Many students got shafted by you, only you did by me.

Why does your save buffer get wiped out if you:

1. save something in a source block
2. back out to directory page
3. press capitol letter to create a block
4. accidently press lab (copy from another lesson)
5. immediatly realize this and press back (without entering
   lesson name)
6. create a source block (no mistakes this time)
7. do IS only to find it rejects this.

These forms...are they the only agreements the University
will take part in?
Granted a standard form is convenient, but might not
the University and individual authors sometimes have
something mutual to gain by 'personalized' agreements?
A standard agreement is really good as a starting point
but. the relations between the University and individuals
are not the always the same. I can't see a
standard agreement being really sensitive to the common best
interest of the University and the individual.

I feel the the extra sensitivity of the University
to the individual would be a big step toward superior
University/individual relations and healthy productivity.
If anyone wants me to dig out and document the foundations
of this point of view I am willing and able to to do so.

Still, in full lesson X search, specify for example:

with the underscore representing a space. It will
not stop at -pause-s or much of anything else. This
works since command fields are padded with spaces till
it reaches the tag field.

A suggestion - (hope it hasn't been mentioned before)

Would anyone like to see a warning when they press
shift-lab in the editor or the block directory if
their lesson is not condensed? Possibly next to
recondense, back to return to the editor.

I think this would be very practical because many
times I would like to take another look at a small
error I spotted before, but it may not be something
that is so important as to require another condense;
it can wait until I have made some bigger changes
to the lesson and need to recondense anyway.

A warning like this would not only save your time,
but it would also help keep the queue short.

Any thoughts? Larry

I should have said "not worth a new condense in itself."

Suppose you're in the middle of a long section of code that
isn't ready to be condensed yet, and you suddenly remember
a bug that you keep forgetting to test. It would be a
waste to condense just for one piece of information, so
the thing to do would be to write yourself a note to check
the bug next time you condense. But it would be much better
to just check it now. IF the condensed version is still
around, you CAN do this for free. The ratio of fixes per
condense rises victoriously!
In other words, it's we who are both forgetful and too lazy
to write ourselves notes who would benefit.

---------- response 10
  04/23/76     08.39     cnb       faa

Negative to suggestion:

1. When you shift-LAB, if the lesson is available you get it
 immediately; otherwise you (usually) get the condense
 queue. It takes only a STOP1 to escape.
2. The only place I can think of where a warning is given
 before an action is taken is the (drastic) action of
 deleting a student. Warnings of this sort could conceiv-
 ably sprout up all over, ie. "Are you sure you want to sign
 on?", ad nauseum. Extra keypresses will be more vehemently
 opposed than anything else...
3. documentation comments should be used liberally--yes,
 even to note bugs to be fixed. If you leave tomorrow
 (voluntary or otherwise) it is extremely helpful to leave
 such notes to your successor.

Lesson jcl is temporarily an opinion poll on what should

things SHOULD be covered will be appreciated.....
Let me add that the lesson WILL contain a syntax-checker

By the way, some interesting research was done on artificial

For those of you who haven't seen the lesson as it was
(and will be again after I get the poll out of it), it
gives you the choice of seeing JCL from 3 viewpoints:
1. IBM standard JCL;
2. U=?I "standard" JCL; or
3. Both.
So, if you see things in the poll you don't understand,
it's probably one of the options you don't know about.
I tried to include every keyword that I could think of at
the time, so don't hesitate to give something a "worthless"
rating...If I put all that stuff in the lesson, it'll take
36 parts....For those who worry about such, _yes_ the design
will be open-ended enough to add things as IBM and CSO
change their "standards".

Suggestion: In all commands that reference a lesson
(-charset-,-common-,-leslist-, maybe not -jumpout-) let a
asterisk mean "the same lesson". For example:

common *,testcom,322

in lesson 'zither' would reference the block 'testcom' in
lesson 'zither', and would reference the same block in the
same file even if the filename is changed to 'autoharp'.

The main use of this feature would be to protect lesson
integrity during filename changes, but it might also be nice
for -use-d code, and might even have some applications
to published lessons. I don't know how easy it would be
to do, but it'd be nice.

That would be just as good, I suppose. The asterisk makes

I need an algorithm to generate permutations
of 6 numbers, but not have all of them generated.

For example: if I have the numbers 1,2,3,4,1,
then one permutation would be...(all start and end with
1)....1,3,2,4,1. However, another possible permutation
would be...1,4,2,3,1. I do not want this last one,
as it is the reverse of the first.
If I can find an algorithm that will not generate
those reversals, then I can save much time and space.

If they are all to begin and end with "1" then you really
only want permutations of 4 numbers. If they are to be
random (i.e.-no particular preference for low digits
appearing in the low digit positions) then the problem is
one of both generation and selection with no way around
actually generating all numbers and then screening for
mirror images. With 4 numbers to be permuted, there are
only 24 possible ways of producing sets ( with mirror images
weeded out as they appear). The least expensive way to
handle things for such a restricted problem is to hand
generate the sets and select one particular set randomly
at time of use. The sets could be stored very cheaply in
about 5 variables if packed without the leading and trailing
"1".

Situation:
At the beginning of this semester, we created a
sizable number of courses, ifiles, and datasets. A small
handful of instructors added their students BEFORE their
datafile was attached. Unless a datafile is attached,
you cannot inspect or change the students data collection
options. Also, unfortunately, students created without
a datafile attached to the course will have their data
options ALL OFF when a datafile does get attached. Only
those students who are created AFTER the datafile is
attached get their data options automatically set ON.?
        A lot of what is considered 'important data' was
lost because of this. To prevent this problem in the
future, data options could be automatically set ON for
everyone in the course when a datafile is finally attached,
or at the least, a warning be given that existing students
will have their data options OFF.

I re-initialized my datafile. For about a solid half hour,

Prints are handled with quite a bit of human interface.

1) Requests are stored for prints (names of files only).
2) An operator goes through every so often and checks
     each request to see if someone is playing games
     by requesting many many prints, etc.
3) The operator then requests the operating system to
     print the lesson. (again only file names are passed)
4) The operating system allows the prints to go through
     sometime (maybe).
5) The operator picks up the printouts and checks to make
     sure that they are alright (no running out of paper
     in the middle, ruined ribbon, etc).
6) The operator then goes through and marks each print
     request as done.

Not exactly fully automated.

Is this a systems error?

---------- response 1
  04/21/76     17.25     frye       mfl

No, it is not. The -calcs- command assumes that a continued
line is simply more "entries" for the -calcs-; in your ex-
ample, the generated code is the same as:

calcs index,z?1,2,a?b,c?d,e?f

for a value of index=1, "z" and "a" are both set to "b".
This ability to "continue" a calcs is almost necessary
in cases when the expression being calculated is lengthy,
and you might not be able to fit the entire -calcs- on one
line.

Of course, in your specific example, (x=y) will never be
equal to anything other than -1 or 0, so the last three
expressions can never be used...

Would you have the condesor check the range of every

writec frac(z),u1,u2,u3,u4

Well if you want to do a phd thesis on an algorithm

computer time to echo your keys to ask questions in

The problem (human-engineering of TUTOR, that is) is really
one of continuation of commands. Combined with the fact
prehaps that 'calcs', 'calcc', and 'calc' are easily
confused...?
A better syntax could perhaps have been?
calc [condition, negative, zero, one, big] $$ calcc
     a ? [condition, negative, zero, one, big] $$ calcs
* the compiler _c__a__n_ detect the cases!?
Out of curiosity, did the original author want to say?
calcs x=y,z?1,2?calc a?b?...?
As for the second reply - may I suggest some study of the
folding capabilities of optimizing compilers? It isn't that
hard to detect quite a number of impossible ranges - the
logical range ¬[-1,0¬] being one of the easiest to detect.

---------- response 6

Yes, the intent was

calcs a=b,z?1,2
calc  c?1
      d?2

It would be nice if the missing -calc- would cause a con-
dense error, since the absence of a command makes no TUTOR
sense there. (If the previous line were -calcc- it might
make sense.)

---------- response 7
  04/22/76     11.58     frye       mfl

But it makes sense to me! Here's an example of where I

calcs (direc(player)-2),hitchk?((deltay>0)$and$(deltay=del tax))
      ((deltay=0)$and$(deltax>0))
      ((deltay<0)$and$(deltax=-deltay))
      ((deltay<0)$and$(deltax=0))
      ((deltay<0)$and$(deltax=deltay))
      ((deltay=0)$and$(deltax<0))
      ((deltay>0)$and$(deltax=-deltay)) 
      ((deltay>0)$and$(deltax=0))

You CAN'T fit this entire -calcs- on one line. Admittedly
there could be a check for a boolean expression branch
value, but don't take away the current capabilities...

---------- response 8
  04/22/76     12.20     judy       pso
I think what Celia meant by "no sense" was, that since
a logical expression can only have two values the other
tags would never be used and thus did not "make sense".

I don't think you would want it to be a condense error---
I can easily conceive of instances where for the moment
a true-false expression is used, but where you don't want
to change the whole -calc- statement. But a warning would

Sorry about the terminology that "muddied up" the issue.

When one of the arguments in a conditional is a number
that is not in the "range" of the expression (function)
then that argument makes "no sense." The issue becomes
clearer if one then thinks about Johnson's note being
written with "frac" instead of "=". Where do we draw
the line bettween those functions which ARE and those
that are NOT checked by the condensor?

It is not so obvious to me that "=" is that special.

Yesterday, I "turned off" a multiple file for the
remainder of the semester. Tonight I was surprized to
note that the record was being used again. A little
experimentation revealed that when a course is shortened
(through accounts), the "turned off" flags are lost. (I
haven't tested this for students, or authors, but it
does happen for multiples.)

Something similar may have also messed up the (s,i,a,m)
indicators on the roster page of 'rhrc'. All of our records
are now indicated as (s)tudents except one created after the
course shortening. -NEXT1-ing thru the records does not
reset the indicators. (They had been correct after the

On 4/20/76 extensive changes were made to my instructor file
I was still listed as the last author. The changes were
noted immediately after I expanded the file. In principle
they may have occurred any time between 4/19 and 4/20.

Chronology: 6 of 9 modules in existence. Ran out of room
while editing module 2. Deleted contents of seldom used
module 5, finised editing module 2. Next day: Expanded file?
I found alterations in modules 2 and 4. The most extensive
were in module 2 where the most intensive editing had
recently occured.

The alterations consisted of interchange of 3 contiguous
lines of titles with 3 catalog names of lessons. Only the
titles appeared, ie, they were not inserted as lessons.
At least 2 lessons had their 1 line description interchanged
with the catalog title of some other lessons existing in the
catalog.

There still seems to be some link between module 2 and
module 3. I just altered the wording of a line of text
in module 3. Then I deleted 2 blank lines in module 2
and inserted a lesson. Then I deleted one line containing
that lesson in module 1(ie that lesson was moved from
module 2 from module 1.) and inserted a new lesson in
module 1.

When I looked back at module 2, the line of text previ-
ously insterted in module 3 now also appeared in with other
text in module 2.

?In other words, possibly the lengthening of my file may
have and some permanent effect on the editing of this file.

a while ago there was a discussion about adding to
the talk machinery an option to state what you want
to talk about before the connection is actually made....
*
whether you decide to take calls or reject them on the
basis of issues of on the nature of the caller, there
are times when it is really inconvenient to talk-- for
example when burning long distance time on dial-up or
when making urgent repairs, giving vip demos, or
just concentrating.
*
what i wish people would when i can't talk to them is
simply leave a p-note. this is almost always a better
and more efficient means of initiating a conversation
than "talk". after an exchange of pnotes, it is easy
to see if "talk" is needed and it can be scheduled at
mutual convenience.

_busy_ talking to someone else so that you could let him know

   I noticed something VERY strange when I stopied out
of a lesson today. The lesson had used >2000 words of
ecs when it consisted of a measly unit command,a lineset
and a single line of text. Looking in aids, I discovered
(for the first time) that linesets are charged for(they
didnt used to be). Now that is fine and dandy, but upon
taking a closer look, I found that the charge is in
ADDITION to an authors 1500 wds, leaving >1400 wds of
UNUSED storage charged to me. Certainly something is
wrong here. I dont appreciate being deleted when I
try to do some work with code that is SUPPOSED to be

Do not take this as a knowing reply, but I noticed the same
problem in a lesson. I also noticed that the extra charge
for the lineset only appeared if I left the lesson while
the lineset was in use. It appears that the new ECS
allocator is able to vary a particular lesson's charge
dynamically.

In other words, if my lesson is buffered up to 1500 words
with useless storage, and I execute either a -lineset- or
a -micro- command, *lcommon* goes up, but *lstorag* does
not go down. Is PLATO smart enough to tell the difference
between storage I want, and storage it wants, and shorten
the latter when appropriate? This may be too sticky to
fix...but I wish it could be done.

Probably the middle of this summer.

The conversion could have been done much earlier if we
wanted to settle for a one-shot conversion routine
that required a system programmer to monitor its
running, but we decided to design it as a general
conversion driver that we could send to multiple
Plato systems to be run by operators. As such, it
requires much more work than was originally expected.

Also, something known as a Master's Thesis has
delayed my work on the conversion routine.

A similar thing happens sometimes when you use a judging
sequence at an arrow that includes -judge exit-. It seems
that the x-coordinate ("column number") of the last margin
set (i.e. the location of the last -at- encountered) is
taken as the left margin of the writing at the arrow.
Strangely enough, it will work correctly if the location
of the last -at- command is the same as the left margin
of the writing at the arrow. So, in your case, if the
helpop unit contained -at 112- rather than -at 101-,
the effect would have been unnoticable.

guerra's explanation is the best explanation that I know
of...notes about errors like this appeared in public notes
about 2 months ago and it was explained that:

in retrospect, we have to keep lots more information at
an -arrow-...like the margin, font, size, rotate, etc.

there is some work in the area to do so...but don't expect
much what with all the necessary work going on.

so, you can "cludge" a solution by making sure the margin
is left at the right place in you helpop (and font, size,

AIDS quote: "Logical operators are meaningful only when
used with logical expressions. An expression such as:

47 $and$ speed

is meaningless and will provide unpredictable results."

How about making any expression ¬= -1 equivalent to a'false'
for $and$ and $or$? It would be logical, and eliminate
a source of error (since it is undefined, but produces
no error indication.)

---------- response 1
  04/22/76     19.05     white       p

We can achieve some sense of speed if we leave the
logical operators undefined for non-logical values,
allowing us to produce code that works fastest for
logical values, though maybe strangely for non-logical
values.

In this particular case, it is easier for us to test
for zero and assume all other things are "true", than
it is to test for -1 and assume all other things
are "false". This action, however, may change at any
time, and without warning.

The whole thing could be made right if 'tudor' had
some type checking and could then either generate an
error if the types of the operators on $and$ and $or$
were not Boolean (T/F) or it could stuff in slower but
more general code in that case.

Suggestion:
  Would it be possible on the course page to bump
periods, commas, and slashes in addition to capitals?
Pressing ? while trying to hit STOP1 is a minor hassle
encountered by fast-typing authors, leading to
          "Course 'iued/' does not exist."
      Bumping of periods and commas, on the other hand,
is suggested to aid new students. A student is told, in
class, to use course name "IU music". He types "IU music"
on the course page and gets in in course iumusic. The
fellow next to him types in "I.U. music" and gets rejected.
This leads to the infamous cry to the consultants;
      "But he did just the same thing and he got in
      all right!"
Since periods and commas are not acceptable in course names
anyway, bumping them will produce no inconvenience for any
present users.

re: helpop, labop, etc.

  It seems that when one uses an inhibited arrow under-
neath an already-plotted character, pressing help (helpop)
will erase an arrow at the inhibited arrow's location, thus
crunching the aforementioned character. (m - ¬6 = m=[¬6> $).
(helpop unit contains an uninhibited arrow.)
  I fully realize that a kludge-fix might be to make
sure that in every case the arrow arrow falls where there
is no character, but this does little for the aesthetic
effects of spacing, etc.

  Is it possible to get a fix, or is tooter going to
have to live with this one?

To demonstrate the "scrunched" character, Hugo some
of the "unreleased" keys which shift the terminal mode
from 'write' to 'erase', etc. He also happened to use one
which starts backwards writing during the times that the
systems people are testing backwards writing. Hence, the

A few questions regarding the "re-registration" process...

1) What will be the determining factor for deciding who
   the director of a given course is? Course ownership
   is not necessarily the same as course directorship.

2) How are the course directors to be notified, since
   they most likely have author records, which will be
   turned off? Also, who do they see to get THEIR
   records turned on?

3) How is the course director to know which of those
   authors in his/her course have signed the forms?

4) What happens if the course director fails to sign
   the forms?

5) Will there be any kind of message put onto the
   "turned-off" page explaining the reason for those
   who do not usually read system features?

implemented. Since the answers may change, I don't want to
answer here and now. Every effort will be made to reduce
the inconvenience and confusion caused by this change.
On the other hand, a complete reregistraion of authors
may turn out to be useful in weeding out records which
should have been deleted long ago and in reminding course
directors that they are responsible for the authors in their
course and should always know who they are and roughly what
they are doing.

Yes, it is unfortunate to have to make announcements with-
out having a complete policy and plan formulated.

1) This requirement to have everybody sign the agreement
   by May 1 or lose their author records is a requirement
   imposed on CERL by the wording of the contract signed
   by the university of Illinois. The systems people and
   others involved here (such as Shiela, poor thing!)
   would have liked more time--but that's how life is.

2) Since the systems people will be working frantically
   right up to the deadline, it seems reasonable that Bill
   put a notice in notes even if it had to be incomplete.
   At least you know that a few days around may 1 will

Is this policy meant to restrict authors to their supporting
institution only? If someone from 'iu' or 'pfw' comes to
Illinois for a visit, will he be unable to sign on? For
if he is able to sign on, it would seem that he would fall
into the "other" author catagory (the 20: group). If this
is the case, I am sad to see the downfall of the "open-
house" approach at CERL, for in many cases the personal
contact from meeting someone from outside Illinois here
greatly added to my author experience. Which leads us back
to the question originally proposed by Peter Maggs, I think:

Why was this whole she-bang tied to author records instead
of file spaces????

the touch panel has and enable/disable function which
prevents it from generating output if its disabled.
If this is the case it would seem that the software
is doing more then is necessary. The reason for this note
is that enables get enabled/disabled at strange times
and when working with external devices or intelligent

A simple test (TERM calc) will verify that the bit patterns
for -0 and 0 are indeed different. The one's complement
representation makes it inherently simple to negate a
number (bitwise complementation). But this necessitates
an end-around carry of the high-order carry bit when doing
addition. That last part is what is considered "messy"
by some designers. It just depends on what is considered 
"in" for computer design. Apparently now two's complement
(not requiring end-around carry) is considered more
aesthetic than one's complement arithmetic. NOTE: That
last statement does _NOT_ imply that one's complement
machines are inferior.

    Note that the " messy" part is there for two's
complement machines in that negation there requires
bitwise complementing plus the addition of 1 (which
can propagate). The "mess" is there either way.
    One's complement does have something in its favor:
all bits are "equivalent" -- carries off the top bit are
added in to the bottom one. You can thus move the binary
point (with regard to simple integer aritmetic) anywhere
you like. It also has an equal range in positive and
negative numbers (if that is an advantage). It suffers
from having two different representations for 0.
    Two's complement has the advantage of having only
one representation for 0. It has one more number in its
negative range than in the positive one (if that is a
disadvantage).
    The choice really is mainly related to circuitry and
speed/economics considerations (as well as the designer's
preference perhaps).

In light of the preceding, I once again bring up
the suggestion for a "bitwise equivalence" operator.
Since '¬)' is not being used for anything important
at the moment, it would appear to make a good candidate.

With the '¬)' (or 'is') operator:

      a ¬) b returns TRUE iff _a_ and _b_
            have the same bit patterns

Thus:

      0 ¬) 0 returns true
     -0 ¬) 0 returns false

If it is too difficult to use '¬) bksp /' ('¬)=/') for
the 'is not' operator, you can always use:
branch not(a¬)b)

       There's a lot of irregularity and fluidity in the
names that units can have.
       Sometimes any string up to 8 characters that doesn't
contain semicolon or comma is ok.
       Sometimes leading blanks are ok before digits but
not before letters, and so on.
       What's the most liberal definition of a unit name
that will always work?
Thanks.

As procedures are worked out, author re-registration
details will be described as responses to the "reregister"
note in new system announcements.

For example, see the current addition there, asking
account directors to send to the write-only gnotes

May 1 can still contain author records.

Section 7 in the "Agreement for PLATO Instructional
Materials Development" reads as follows:

"It is understood and agreed that the Author will not
provide any other person with access to the University's
PLATO system,¬ .¬ .¬ ."

Notice that this means that students (and every user of a
multiple) at the U of I must sign one of these sets of
forms.

Is there a discount rate on 36,000 copies of these forms?

---------- response 1
  04/24/76     22.59     golden       s

Only authors need sign. The intention of the quoted passage
is to prevent passing on your author record, something which
has always been frowned upon.

---------- response 2
  04/25/76     00.59     alan       hebrew

Contracts can always be modified by mutual consent. I would
assume that, for instance, making someone a course director
would clearly by implication free him from any obligation
that might be read into the contract that he not make

have to be a cigarette smoker to take it. It's being run
for a Consumer Behavior class project so please help me out

       Before you waste your time in "adjecticves",
wait till the thing works! I typed in the numeral "3"
at the first (and last arrow I was given), it was
judged no, and I was told to pick a number between
1 and 7.....
       It may have changed since I went to school,
but at that time, 3 certainly was between 1 and 7.

Regarding the ed317s survey:

        How can those questions be answered by someone who
has never smoked? The questions ask you if there is any
difference between two given brands of cigarettes, but if
you have never smoked, how in the world can you answer the
question with any pretence of intelligence?

It seems to me that these surveys will be meaningless anyway
because of the highly selected subjects. (Only a certain
type of person is willing to spend 5 minutes on such

How about making this a more accessable option for
instructors, rather than having it necessary to enter
"user," which few of our instructors even know exists.

a P.S. to those who have desperately wanted to contact
an instructor with his/her -talk- options off: in an
emergency, the operator on duty CAN page someone with
their options off.

I agree. However, I think we should be careful to

       The new command zcondok seems to be useful for some
aplications; yet it would seem to be even _more_ useful if
it would return the number of errors and/or warnings
rather than just indicating they occured.
       Some times the author knows there are a given
number of errors, and would be more interested in knowing
if the error count exceeds what is expected. If this were
the case I see no need to distinguish between errors and
warnings.

       We have always required working system

and have usually encouraged users to do the same.

       I question whether adding new -zcondok-

less seriously than they should.

       Are there reasonable cases where people
can't easily remove all condense errors?

We had a large series of line errors at Valpo.
Evidently the phone co. made some changes in the
lines to clear up some line error problems (noisy line)
and their changes "fixed" things so that the
auto-answer wouldn't stay locked on our signal.

The problem has cleared up somewhat after some Plato
service from Chicago and after much talking to 
Urbana. The output level of the modem required
adjusting. Still not quite right but working enough
to leave it alone.

Authors still need the codeword to edit or inspect the

new option only DISALLOWS editing the course (regardless

There is no way at present but it certainly would be nice

ignorable words which could be merged with several other

Yes -- this type of capability should be implemented.
I would also appreciate a service routine that did a
vocabs - concept correlation, putting unused vocabulary
words in one list, and used words in another. Otherwise,
the bigger the vocabs gets, the worse the deadwood problem
gets.

This afternoon I'm having some problems with the editor.

Shift-P to set blocks for condense (erase the -mark) does
not seem to work. When I type the letter of the block to
erase the '-' mark, it erases it, but then pressing next
or back and when the screen replots, the mark is still
there. This is very repeatable as I cannot now (at this
moment) reset my blocks to condense. Any help??

Why, if you are affiliated with the University are you
not allowed to be an author in a non-UI course? I'm
sure that there is someone who is affiliated and is also
affiliated with some other institution that uses PLATO
(maybe a summer job somewhere else using PLATO) and for
some of various reasons needs to be registered in that
institution's PLATO courses...of course, (according to
the System Announcements Note) the system doesn't check
to make sure the person isn't affiliated, so the course
director simply says no, but... 

Is the name typed in going to be kept permanently with
the author record (or maybe a pointer to the on-line

You see, the SHIFT-COPY pulls 1 word from the front of the
block, which in your case was probably " " or something
similar. When others tried it with their own blocks, they
got whatever was in that first word -- which could well have
been nothing at all (i.e,, a 0 word)... You might try con-
verting the entire unused portion of your lesson to common,
then destroying the common, then trying your procedure
again. If it works then, you've got a problem...

We do back-out users if at all possible before reloading

not an intentional reload.

However, even in the event of a crash, students should

It would be handy when you are re-working some code and

   Your jump command will jump you to another unit
no matter what the value of lesname is at the time. You
have a 'jump condition,true,false' since you don't allow
any way to fall through the jump, you will never get to 
the judge command. You might want to either do the
judge prior to the jump, or change the jump so that if
a desired condition is not met, the student will fall
through the jump. i.e. 'jump condition, right1,x'.
If the lesson is the right one, he will be jumped,
otherwise, he will fall through.

The problem is that the -judge- works fine, but execution
continues and the -transfr- and unconditional -jump- are
executed, no matter what the judgement. You may want to
use a judge tag such as "noquit", which will not only
change the judgement to "no", but will stop processing
regular commands. You don't need a -space-.

do with your question.

arrow   1010
ok
judge   (v6>5),ok,no
transfr blah blah
jump    newunit

   A judgement of "no" does NOT stop processing. The
-transfr- and -jump- will be done _regardless_ of the value
of v6.

   If the -transfer- and -jump- should be
done only when the answer is "correct", then put an
-endarrow- before the -transfr-.

are now. If this changes, there will/may be temporary

Concerning the new course editing options which can be
set for instructors: A more useful interpretation would
be to have those two bits mean the following:

        1) Can edit own course without change code
        2) Can edit any course, given change code

rather than the current

        1) Can edit own course
        2) Can edit other courses

That way, an instructor could edit his own course if he

with option (1)  turned off cannot access his course at all.

It seems that it is impossible to change the 'edit own

that option is turned off in your own record. That way

of the jumpout q or if the lesson name is no longer

Hello, all.
I would like to suggest an added attraction for
the lesson editor. As most of you know, pressing
Qxxxxx... at the directives arrow, zaps you to AIDS
for a handy-dandy explanation of xxxxx...!
     In most of my work with the Q option, it seems
that I usually look at command definitions.
     Also, these commands are the first non-zero(or
non-055) word of a lesson line.
    Thus I suggest that the Q option should be able to
take a decimal integer number as a tag, the number being
the line of code which is used to locate the object of
search in AIDS. The info is available, as in the R option.
Also, instead of inserting a string of chars directly
into the tag, PLATO does it indirectly, after locating
the first word of the line specified.

I think that a good range for the numbers could be

31 as that is the max. lines per plato editor page.
And I include 0 so that you can search the line just
above what is displayed (so you don't have to B1).
e.g.:
1 unit     what

3 at        2121

Usually, a student can STOP1 out of the condense queue.
There are, however, soem unfortunate exceptions:

If the student is a routed student and is condensing
the router, he cannot sign off until the router is
condensed.

If the student is not routed, and goes straight to the
lesson specified in his restart information. he cannot
sign of until _that_ lesson has been condensed.

    I have noticed that there has been a lot of uproar
concerning whether a person is allowed to make a list
of lessons for the purpose of jumping out to them,
and then advertising the fact that he/she has that
list.
  The question is whether there will be the same
problem with leslists containing game names for the
purpose of scanning the site, e.g. intergraf.
It would seem that the same principle would apply
in both cases, and the author of the scanner should
be required to get the permission of the authors
before he/she releases the lesson.

---------- response 1
  04/28/76     01.04     anderer       ee

Not necessarily....As I see it, the furror over jumpouts
is dictated by system policy that you _should_ not enter
or execute a lesson without the authors permission. And 
these jumpouts provide an easy route of access that tends
to submerge this concept.

HOWEVER, knowing that someone is in lesson 'example' is a
different case (in my mind) than entering it yourself.

I'm also afraid the concept you propose is somewhat
unworkable. For carrying the argument to it's logical
conclusion, lesson 'site' shouldn't display lesson names,
unless the operator has the author's permission to
view the lesson name. Rather absurd.

I guess it comes down to the difference between 1) listing
a lesson name, and 2) providiing an access means to it.

There were was one crash and several backouts while trying

information as to what caused the first very strange (and

subsequent loss of access to many disk packs. Many system
programmers, the Computer-Engineers and PLATO operators

We of course regret the interruption of service. The down

---------- note 7 lineset sg
  04/28/76     11.48     ahasic       med

   I have some suggestions for the lineset editor. The char-
acters in use option simply gives a list of the characters
being used. Unless the lineset contains gothic characters
this gives no hint of the contents of the linechars. Why
not include a key option to display the small linechars and
a one word label for the large linechars?

   Why on earth is the grid and the gross cursor movements
7?15? The slight deviation from the 8?16 system used every-
where else on Plato makes it too confusing to be of any use.
It is easiest now to ignore the present 7?15 system and use
the cursor location update option for reference. I think an
8?16 grid and either an 8?8 or 8?16 gross cursor movement
would be much more useful.
---------- response 1
  04/28/76     13.45     fortner       p

        To plot the linechars along with the slots on
that page would take forever for most linesets: if one
want to see what a particular linechar looks like, one
may press that key on that page.
        It would also take a large amount of computing time
to plot all the linechars: since you may have changed the
lineset, the editor simulates the plotting, as opposed to
just executing a lineset command.

        The cursor used to move 8?8, but it was changed
to 7?15 by request, for reasons i cant remember now.
        If there are no objections, i could change it
back to 8?8 or 8?16.

---------- response 2
  04/28/76     14.15     friedman       csa

Perhaps it was changed to make consecutive characters
connected; I recall that was a problem people had with
linechars, and one suggested solution was to have them
overlap by one dot. But I would favor going back to 8?16,
the same as everything else in Plato. Connection can be
achieved by designing multiple linechars so that no one
line is in more than one char; see lineset "keytops",
lesson "cslibrary", for an example of this technique.

---------- response 3
  04/28/76     17.06     d sherwood       uni

the misleading 7?15 makes it impossible to get large
linechars right when you're doing them from a charset --
unless you know about it, and do everything one dot at a
time in order to keep your sanity. I agree that it should
go back to 8?8.

ps -- could you put in an option to allow medium-size
pictures? i.e. from 3?2 char pictures. The large grid has
too small a scale to show clearly.

---------- response 4

would this then mean that everything now in a lineset
would have to be redrawn? If so and no easy conversion
was made, I am aginst it because this would then
cause everone who presently uses a lineset to
edit every character --which in some cases
is no small job..

Yes, but that's no help if there's no -dataon- in the

not have a -dataon-; if it crashes, there's no way to

We have talked before about an execution error collector
attached to the lesson, rather than to the course. Maybe
it could be attached through accounts?

CDC will surely have to have some of execution error
collector for the "published" lessons in order to catch
any errors. And don't say that "published" lessons won't
have errors--we all try, but!

I remember McKeown (I think it was) telling about going
absolutely _crazy_ looking for an execution error. He
finally found that if you entered the HELP sequence,
entered 6 (!) incorrect responses, and used ERASE to 
erase each one. that it caused an exec error. CDC will
never be able to proof-read sufficiently to catch that type
of error in advance.

        Is using "*list parts" that difficult to type?
Or is it that partialling in blocks is more difficult
then typing in all the block names correctly spelled?

I don't think that arbitrarily changing partial flags to
get some blocks (with notes, for example) listed would help
the executability of the lesson...

   I would be suprised if you were storing your
notes in a lesson t was in general usage. I was under
the impression (maybe incorrectly so) that most people
stored their notes in a work lesson in which case changing
the partial flags around isn't to much of a burden.

looks good.. How about a compliment to it that would
list everything except the listed blocks? Partialling
out and *list parts isn't always feasible.

      Would it be possible to have the *list off command
take the block number, letter (ie. 2b) instead of the name?

Most of the blocks in my lesson have the same name
because it is "use"ed. When I am working on one or two
blocks and the rest of the lesson works I can't play
with the parts flags so I have no choice but to print
the entire lesson.

Well, I discovred the ERASE key before the help notes

When you do use erase, the cursor is at the endpoint

Be sure to get the exact way your people signed. Unless
you type in their name the way they signed, the routine
won't recognize them (in general, a full formal first name
and middle initial will be listed unless the person signed
in a different fashion).

Be sure you know the correct name and middle initial

they signed it without using their middle initial that's\
the way it is going to be on the list and the only way

U of I authors have to. Period. Pardon my potential ig-

agreement? If you don't write lesson material, then tech-

records will work adequately in that case. Does that
answer the question?

I assume you are working at Parkland Community College,

after asking for HELP, NEXT or BACK should leave you in

although it is very tightly packed, there is probably
enough room in the HELP paragraph to specify that
NEXT is the key required to exit with the chagne
in effect.

        Another suggestion:
        I don't know if this is practical, but how about
a method to go to a different part of the lesson while
in the "p" option. If you want to condense only two
blocks which are in different parts, you have to leave
"p" option, go to the other part, then push shift-p
again. (Since + and - are being use, how about the number
keys for this?)

---------- response 5
  04/28/76     23.23     koning       csa

The point about making BACK exit without changes is
that you don't want to have the changes take effect
because of a backout (if you're in the middle of changing
things), and the backout uses both BACK and SHIFT-STOP.

---------- response 6
  04/29/76     03.04     broadus       css

I think you need some key-press a decision point
to mean "I think I really don't want to do this."
If it is decided that BACK should be changed as the
key for deciding not to make changes, then this
change should also be made in the instructor mode
editing where BACK is ALSO used to mean "I think I
really don't want to do this."

I agree that SHIFT/STOP is not the proper way to get
out of such a situation.

I would like to suggest a revision to the -find- and
-findall- commands so that more than one (consecutive)
variable can be searched for at one time. In other words,
I want to be able to compare n1 with nc1,nc3,nc5,... and
n2 with nc2,nc4,nc6,... and have the location where n1=
nc(1+n) $and$ n2=nc(2+n). Right now, you have to do this
with two -findall- statements and then compare them:

findall n1,nc1,200,nc500,100,2
findall n2,nc2,200,nc700,100,2
doto    1,n10?1,100
writec  n1=nc(1+nc(500+n10))$and$n2=nc(1+nc(700+n10)), I've
        found it, It's not this one

etc.

I think the advantages of the extended -find- or -findall-
is plainly seen when you start talking about character
strings of, let's say 40 chars, which would require 4
-findall-, etc.

Hmmm. If all the suggestions for improvements to -find-

13 or 14 arguments by now! There is a certain amount of
time and space overhead associated with each argument,
hence we reach points where it just isnt practical to add
all the excellant suggestions that have been offered.

        One -findall- followed by looping thru the found
items for the other tests will do it pretty efficiently
(especially if you know which record will be matched the
least frequently, and do the -findall- on it).
        Well, if somebody writes PLATO for the STAR machine,
more of these exotic suggestions could be met...

In the system-designed groupnotes files, you can go back and
edit your note. You can then accidentally delete it by
pressing BACK1. Since the deleted note still takes up
space, wouldn't it be worthwhile to install the ability to
un-delete something? It seems a shame to type it in again,
storing it twice.... (Or am I the only idiot who's done
this?)

This sounds like a good idea to me except for the security

the director or the writer. But that could be minor enough
not to inhibit this change.

But why should SHIFT-BACK delete the note? Shouldn't
it just leave the original copy of the note intact?
If you want to delete the note, you have the option to
do that after you hit SHIFT-EDIT to re-edit the note.
Why have an additional, semi-warned delete option
several keypresses later?

(Yes, I too deleted a note using SHIFT-BACK and was

They typically look like like the following:

The lesson directory is (in my words) the page that
permits the AUTHOR to go into any of 7 blocks per
part of a TUTOR lesson. I'm sure that is covered
in AIDS somewhere.
It appeared to me that I was at my directory, able to

I know what a directory is but your wording was a little

supposed to be able to do this thing. As it turns out,
there are some strange things a lesson can do to force
a user to the lesson's directory page, but I have no

I just thought of what could have happened. (In case there
is no known way through tutor.) If that lesson jumped you
to your lesson, and it was empty (that is, it ran without
plotting anything), a NEXT keypress would then give you
your directory page, since Plato remembers the last lesson
you were in. In other words, was your lesson empty, and
did you press NEXT twice at that arrow? If so, then you
were simply allowed in because your security code matched
properly, and there's nothing to worry about. ¬???==??Dan===¬=I=[='"=7]=ˆˆ_

  04/29/76     09.04     fay       o

Earlier this morning a small portion of one of the active
packs was inadvertently overwritten. The result is that
some files are in a "funny state". If one of your files
were affected you will note one or more of the following
symptoms: the lesson directory may be messed up, you may
not be able to edit your file, one or more blocks may be
messed up, and various and sundry other funny things.
We have a listing of most of the files which have been
affected and are in the process of getting backups on-line
as soon as possible.

The only pack which seems to have been affected is "scope".
The individual authors will have to "fix" the files by
themselves: we are providing the backups for this purpose.
The backup of any file which was messed up will bear the
same name as the original, preceded by an "x".

We are limited to 10 chars in lesson titles: if the
original lesson name was already 10 chars long, the backup
name will be 10 chars and we will drop the last char in
order to accommodate the "x" on the front of the name.

If you have problems with one of your files this morning
please be patient: we are creating the backups as quickly
as possible. If you believe you have a problem which is
not going to be solved by our current backup efforts, please
get in touch with the operator or leave a request for a 
backup in lesson "backups".

We regret the inconvenience caused. We believe no one will
end up irretrievably losing anything from the affected
files.

The showing of the added pack information in lesson

As for the other problems:

a) As George Myers pointed out, we are notifying authors

   the lesson.
b) We are continuing our search for damaged files; this
   requires the preparation of special software which
   necessarily means the problem's solution is going to
   take a little time. We cannot guarantee a time for
   completion of our search.
c) As individual users encounter damaged files they are

   the problem, in lesson "backups". The processing

  The reason that the three sites vary is because

causing the signal to shift out of the detector

To summarize previous notes on the subject:
We had a problem with pack "scope" which occurred around

other files on the pack to be partially overwritten.
We have backups of all files affected but do not yet have
a complete list of which files were affected.

Here is what is being done/will be done:

a) We are conducting our own search for damaged files.
   When we locate such a damaged file we will get a
   backup (same name with an "x" preceding it) and will
   notify the author.

   If, in the interim, you come across one of your own
   files which is on pack "scope" and which appears to
   have been damaged, submit a request in lesson "backups".
   Give any info you can on the nature of the damage. We
   will be giving top priority to backup requests today.

It seems the editor has been changed so that a change

editing the block to be changed. Could this please be
changed back? I don't know about others, but I want to
know when any change has been made to the block, including
its name. In fact, I have been using this in a backup
copy of my common and leslist to tag the common and
leslist blocks with the date and time I copied them:
I just changed the name to itself. As it is now, I
don't know ANY way to set the date and time last edited

  No, this was a deliberate change to fix what was felt
to be a system error. The date/time of last edit for a
BLOCK is meant to reflect the time of last change to the
source text in that block. Note that setting/changing tab-
sets also no longer cause that date/time info to be updated.
Changes like these and changes to the partial flags and
to the lesson data ARE all reflected however in the listing
of last date/time of edit for the lesson as a whole.
  Obviously that date/time info should be preserved
during a block copy--if that is not being done, it is
an error and we will get it fixed eventually.

create another unit somewhere else in the lesson.

There is a major conceptual problem in accounting for the
use of -use-d lessons. And some programming problems too
if you want to know which blocks of your -use-d lesson were
used how much by each separate -use-ing lesson!

There doesn't seem to be any automatable way to determine
the royalty split between a -use-ing and a -use-d lesson.

Well, for starters, does he want to know how often the

presumably be easy to get; or does he want to know how
often the condensed lesson is executed, which is harder?

The capability doesn't currently exist, and I haven't
checked with the relevant systems person on the Arden Hills
system (that's CDC's PLATO system), but I suspect it would
not be difficult to provide (off-line, in CDC's account
structures) the owner of a -use-d lesson with a monthly
listing of the activity of files that -use-d his lesson.

But there are problems there. What if a new -use-r comes
along. How does he find out about the existence of a file
available for -use-? How does the original owner (who is
not on the AH system) arrange permission for him to -use-
the file if he does find out about it? Who pays the costs
of doing that monthly accounting?

---------- response 6
  04/30/76     16.49     john risken       cdcc

These and other questions make -use- lessons conceptually
hard to handle in an environment where the original owner
is no longer present or able to exercise direct control.

I would appreciate further discussion of this topic.

Sorry, I am VIOLENTLY opposed to such a change! That

which is always our overriding consideration in all that
we do here.

In particular, you could always send a note to all
multiples EVEN IF THERE WERE NO multiples registered
in the course! AND YOU CAN STILL DO THIS!

Therefore, it is clear that consistency requires that
you be able to send a message to all the authors in a
course even if there are no authors, and even if there
can never be any authors!

HUH? I can see why you'd want to send a note to all
multiples, simply because it is too much work for the
editor to determine that there aren't any. But that
does not hold for authors if there can't possibly be
any because the course doesn't allow them.
Allowing you to do something that will always be useless
just for the sake of consistency is ridiculous!

Try lesson "kludge". It is very useful for such things
as dropping storage (and linesets) and starting your lesson
over again, re-executing the ieu.

In other words, in a unit where you want to drop the
lineset, do a "jumpout kludge,kludge1". That will return
you to the unit you came from so you better do some sort
of varaible checking so you don't get into a loop of jumping
up and back.

the records editor still works well, with all the

of minor suggestions.?
1) Could we have the ability to change an author into
an instructor? There will be times when a person ceases
to be an active author, but continues on Plato from time
to time, either for actual instructor use, or as an
administrator, or just as an occasional user. It would
be useful to be able to change his record, rather than
destroy and recreate it.?
2) On the page on entering an author's "real" name to
check for registration, would you activate -COPY- at the
last name and first name arrows? Frequently, the signon
name is one these names; it would make for less typing,
especially for a long name.

instructor can study. Instructor sign-ons are often
give to people who use plato very little and have no
idea of what the plato names are to the lessons they want
to see.
        So these instructors have 2 sign-ons one for
editing the course and one that is a student.

        As a simpler solutions could I see a flag that
would give the instructor the option of going to the
router attached to the course instead of the option
to choose a lesson to study. This would mean only
one sign-on for these instructors and a lot less

It's easy if you use the system router: you can set flags
in the instructor's signon that allow him to execute only
lessons in the "catalog", i.e., in the instructor file
attached to the course. If you're not using the system
router (mrouter), then you're stuck, because it's not
possible to attach an instructor file at all.

        I believe about the simplest solution would be
in courses which are routed by routers other than mrouter
to change the flag which allows the instructor to go to
the catalog of mrouter.
        In courses not routed by mrouter, this flag would
read 'Go to the ROUTER for your course', and would have
that effect. Once in the router, instructors could be
controlled in any way the router designer decides.

There seems to be a strange interaction when there is

shift STOPs from a routed lesson. What happens is an
execution error with an unknown error type. This happens
whether or not the student should have been jumped out by
the command.

Pressing DATA from the press DATA to continue page however
then allows normal reentry into the router. Initial

And yes, upon initial entry into the router the jumpout

   I don't think I really understand what your problem is,
but I'll make a couple of comments anyway. If you have
a set of "answers" that are fixed and which you want
to use in several different contexts, the use of -vocabs-
and -concept- may be appropriate. Typically "anscnt"
is most useful in that case; note too that one can now
set user information with this structure which is
independent of anscnt.
   It is hard to see what reason there would be for
repeating entries or putting in spurious -wrong-s.
With a fixed number return guaranteed from the answers
unit, judging in each case then just requires a
-judge- and a -writec- to give the proper judgment and
any desired feedback for each individual question.

---------- response 3

also, you should be using -answer_c_- for the type of problem
you state. It is very inefficient to go through the entire
list of all answers for an entire drill and then check that
the answer the student matched is the particular answer
for a particular drill item. With the -answer_c_- command
you conditionally pick just the one (or several synonymous)
possibility for that particular problem at hand...and save
tremendously on system processing resources.

        Now that you can have a charset loaded upon entering
a lesson to be edited, is there a chance that any of the
aids lessons that use special characters could be modified
with:
        -1- inhibit charclear... with a meaasge that
            the present charset has been modified and
            the author may want to re-load it when he
            returns to the editor.
         or
        -2- Only have the charset loaded the first time
            that you enter the lesson.

If you had notes before the crash, and then deleted them,
Plato still has the NOTES flag set from when you last signed

      The notes flag is part of your author record. If 
the system crashes before you sign off after reading new
notes, the disk copy of your record is not updated, and,
consequently, the notes flag is not cleared. Short of
writing your record back every time you read a new note
there's no way to prevent this from happening. Its not
a bug, it's just something you have to live with.

That shouldn't have anything to do with it. Do you remember
whether or not you received any notes during the last time
you signed on (i.e. just before the crash)? If you

        a) received a NOTE and saw the NOTES flag,

        b) read the note, then deleted it, and

        c) didn't sign off before the crash,

THEN under these circumstances you will see the NOTES flag
after the crash, but have no notes. I can't think of any

One situation in which I often find myself where this
feature would be extremely handy is when I have ordered
a print of a nearly full datafile which is currently in
use. Naturally I want to reinitialize it as soon as
the print is done so as to lose as little data as possible.
This forces me to interrupt my work frequently (ca.
every 5-10 minutes) during the period from request of
print to the completion of the print, often as long as
2 to 2 1/2 hours. Again, like so many of the requests
made of the systems people, this is very far from a
life or death issue, but, if it would be fairly easy
to implement and not impose and inordinate burden on
PLATO operations in general, it _would_ be a nice feature.

While such features could be implemented (as the current
notification feature has been) remember that the fact that
a print has been executed and verified by the operator
does not guarantee that it will get to you (far be it from
me to question the safety of the U.S. Mail,etc. but...).
If you have data that are really important, NEVER destroy
your original source until you actually have the hard copy

The terminals in our classroom run without a human

the earphones for the audio lessons. Does anyone have
a little black box than hooks into the audio unit and

        This isn't too hard if you use a standard
1/4 inch phone plug, with a stereo phone jack. The
extra channel will be connected to the ground sleeve,
and if the plug is removed, contact is broken, meaning
the phones have been removed for one reason or another.

          Let me rephrase that to be a stereo plug, and
stero phone jack (three wires, common, plus two channels).
The third wire constitutes a dummy circuit, which no

should be able to be detected.

One alternative sometimes used by language labs is to
follow the lead of the airlines. Students buy the
disposable plastic-tubing "headphone" for their own use
and plug them into a socket that contains the transponder.
Each person thus has their own headset (preventing transfer
of bacteria, etc) and the expensive part of the system is

Authors who are writing or revising lessons with an eye to
their possible publication by Control Data should bear in
mind that CDC's version of TUTOR often lags several months
behind the U of I's version. For example, CDC PLATO has
none of the commands (-sort-, etc.) that have been
released in recent months, though these will be available
in a few days.?
Eager beavers who keep their lesson coding up-to-the-minute
can therefore easily make their lessons non-exportable.?
There is not yet a formal schedule whereby CDC receives and
implements updates to PLATO from the U of I. Thus there is
no sure way of knowing when a new command will become
'safe'.?
It is now safe to use new commands up to and including
-sort-. I will post a notice here when a firm schedule
for the next update is established.??

I do not see this as any kind of problem. The time between
the writing of a lesson and the publication of that lesson
by CDC will almost always exceed by far the update time
for PLATO systems. That update time has already been
reduced to a couple of months, and will soon be a few
weeks. Publication will take longer than that.

Authors include new commands primarily because such
commands provide new capabilities. I don't think anyone
changes running lessons for the fun of it.

Since we are moving to a scheme in which all PLATO systems
will be close to each at all times, I would prefer not
to burden authors with this consideration. After all,
lessons to be distributed surely will be lessons which
have already been used for a period longer than the
inconsistency time between systems.

I do hope you will keep us informed of CDC's considerations,
in order that our author community can have continued
inputs. Still, our own authors should be aware
that the suggested policy (in terms of avoiding new features
in instructional lessons) does not apply on the CERL system,
since features are not formally announced until ready for
use, and we do need feedback on potential problems.

the intention of both the CERL and CDC system software
staffs is to have all PLATO systems compatible...
AND to allow for the continued development of PLATO/TUTOR
at the CERL site. This
remarkable feat has been planed in several meetings
between the two groups...and fully half the software
work now going on is directly concerned with this.
(are you aware of such efforts?)

It should be a close race to see if the software staff
has weekly compatibility between systems a fact before
the publishing groups at CDC have the "published" library
mechanisms working.

---------- response 4

No policy is stated in the note. Indeed if authors do
not anticipate immediate release of a lesson (where
'immediate' currently means 'within four months') there
is no reason to avoid new commands.

The note was prompted by the fact that one very heavily
used lesson which was transferred up here for review two
weeks ago used new commands that CDC's system did not
have. The lesson in question had been used for well over
a year, but the author, being conscientious, updated it
to include a desirable new feature.

Authors frequently do change working lessons in minor ways
to improve their performance. This is all to the good from
our point of view except when the changes make the lesson
incompatible with our system.

no, something has been changed...in retrospect, there was
an error in the system in that -judge- commands WERE
executed in the "erase-unit-contingency!..well, that should
NOT have been the case since no "jugding status" remains
at this time. The change was done to fix a system bomb-off
condition. -judge- commands in the "erase-unit-contingency"
were changed to cause an execution error to inform authors
that Judge- commands in this situation have NO function.
The other option would have been just to ignore -judge-
commands in this situation...but it seemed appropriate to
"force" a "clean" use of the language.

This doesn't seem consistent with the way the rest of Tutor
works. For example, an answer command does not cause an
execution error when it is encountered during the regular
pre-arrow state. Since the same unit containing a judge
command could be used as an eraseu unit and also executed
when the judge command would be appropriate, it seems the
judge command should simply be ignored during the eraseu
state.

PLATO tries to allow an instructor to run classes with
little programmer intervention. One of the tasks that
teachers face is setting up individual curricula for each
student, without using the system router.

Programming considerations make it necessary for me to
use bit maps in student router variables to set up
individual curricula. It is unreasonable to expect
teachers to set up the variables, particuclarly with the
course records variable editor.

It would be VERY useful, and within the spirit of the
PLATO teacher-programmer concept, if we could "write"
router variables directly from a tutor lesson with a
command analogous to the "readr" command.

I would appreciate any comments. I would be especially
nice if we could have this in time for next semester's
routers!

I agree. Such a feature would be extremely useful, not
only for beginners, but for anyone who uses segmented
variables for diagnostics and/or routing. If one could
set the value of any segment, regardless of its size,
simply by typing the desired value at the appropriate
arrow, it would be great. As things are now, I'm
frequently tempted to use 3 (or 6 or 9, etc) bit
segments even if I don't need such large ones simply
because they are easier to work with in octal notation;
this frequently results in wasteful use of some student
variables.

        When one enters a lesson which has a charset to
be loaded, and one wishes to skip loading, it is often
convenient to press STOP. This leads to a warning message
telling the author that STOP was pressed, and to press
NEXT1 to go ahead and enter the lesson.
          I cannot think of a case where the error message
is really necessary. If STOP is pressed accidentally,
and the charset does not load, it should be immediately
obvious to the author. He can then back out and load his
charset again, since the charset flag is not set by an
interrupted load.
        So...can we, just once, have the system a little
_less_ fancy? Or, can the key for passing the warning be
changed to NEXT rather than NEXT1?

"eades" of "propman" has an elaborate setup where he has
interfaced what I believe is one of IBM's memory typewriters
with his terminal (with the benefit of a custom built
interface). As I understand the setup, you pretty much
have to write your own print routines to drive the little

   I have a question concerning the new PLATO V terminal
that was mentioned in projects. Will this terminal have its
own built-in air conditioner?!?! the reason I ask is over at
chem annex we must keep two room air conditioners going at
all times and it gets COLD in the room( any thing below 27¬oC
is cold to me). And if I recall correctly there has been a
few times this year when the operator at cerl had to clear
the classrooms and turn the terminals off because of air
condiioning problem and langlab to for that matter. Now if
every terminal had its own air conditioner then that would
make a lot of people happier.

a more serious question about new terminals and cdc
plato is with respect to support of microfiche. there
is an interesting though slightly old discussion of
this issue in "peripherals". the discussion is
noteworthy for its lack of systems comment.
*
this information is important to many: does the
system plan to support microfiche, as it is now used,
in the next generation of terminal equipment and
in subsequent issues of the existing equipment?

       Jack Stifle mentioned that microfiche will be
supported as a optional device with the newer terminals,
and will fasten to the back of the unit in some manner.
        It would seem that the CDC-CRT terminals could
not easily use the standard PLATO microfiche units.
       Good luck with self conditioning for terminals.
Most people are happy with the optimal temp for the
devices, about 23-25¬oC. It would be nice to be able to
take them outside and get a tan while you program..

The cheapest way to protect against on/off overheat is
to get some tape and tape the on/off switch in the on
position. This would be unobvious to the beginning user as
the on state of the switch is flush with the terminal
cabinet. Those in the know could just peel the tape back.

Before we air conditioned our terminal room, physical plant

      Also, term talk's demand your immediate attention
(the same way a telephone 'must' be answered right away)
no matter what you are doing, while a pnote can be put-off
for a while until your 'current crisis' is over. Gossiping
is much better in person or on the phone anyway..

    I would much rather receive and reply to a pnote in many
cases than try to get something across via -talk-.. Pnotes
can be written, re-written, corrected for grammar and
spelling, and be censored from obcentities all at your
leisure. They can also be saved and/or printed and/or
written down until you are finished with them.
       
       Not to mention that one pnote can be sent to
many different people much easier and faster than calls.
Of course, some term talks are ture problems requiring
immediate attention, but really not that many.

Besides, slow typists are pure agony.

It's hard to believe that there is much of a correlation
between [number of terms talk] and[ listing on user page].
Surely most people find it easier to just call and perhaps
get a "not present" than to check the user page. If you
don't want calls, turn off your talk option--you'll get
pretty near your usual number otherwise. So again I ask
for a reason.

I beg to differ.

For those authors who are will known on the system, having
their name in the user list is an open invitation for
anyone and everyone to call them. I have sat next to
Bruce Parrello and Mike Berger, and watched them get so
frustrated with spurious TERM-talks that they went into
the user's list and removed their names. That cured the
problem immediately. I have also sat next to some idiots,
who, between games, look at the users list, and say some-
thing like "Gee, I think I'll ask Eisenberg how things are
in Delaware." The abuse comes mostly from those who get the
idea to call only after seeing a name in the list.

The correlation is there, I assure you. (But please don't

them a note. It can wait.)

Yes. My basic reservation on this matter is that it
should take a pretty good reason to justify anonymity
on a publicly-financed system like PLATO. Admittedly,
suppressing the user page listing doesn't exactly make a
user anonymous, but it's a step in that direction and
deserves explanation.

---------- response 11

I don't agree.

1) It certainly is true that well-known people can't get
their own work done if they show up in "user".

2) A person doesn't need any "reason" for not listing
himself -- public financing has nothing to do with it.
There is absolutely NO obligation to advertise that you
are present. Rather than saying that a person should have
a good reason for suppressing his name in the list, I would
say that a person should have a good reason for cluttering
that long list with his own name. (Example: a site
director should probably list himself in order that someone
can ask questions related to using that site.)

If you were a judge and this case came before you, Bruce,
you'd have to disqualify yourself because of your position.
Lots of people think that performance is improved by accoun-

Such people might well support user-page suppression for
your reason no.1, but not no.2 By the way, which is the
default position of the user page listing switch?

To speed up eraseing of odd-shaped paragraphs of text
without taking up all the disk space needed for seperate
at's and erase's, I suggest the following format for the
erase command:

erase 12;3,4;52;;13.5;0;12,10

this would (starting from the at) erase 12 chars on the
first line; 3 chars for the next 4 lines; nothing on the
sixth line; 13 on the seventh line starting 5 chars in
from the margin; 0 chars; and 10 lines of 12

This of course would condense into the individual at's and
erase's but would save a lot of disk space and make things
a lot more readable.

---------- response 1
  05/04/76     00.18     blomme       s
   The new terminals have a block erase feature and
with this it saves time everywhere (and even disk
space if that matters) to use the normal multiple
line format for the erase command, like:

erase 50,8 $$ 50 characters, 8 lines
  
   To spend time counting characters on each given
line and to try to implement some complicated format
to permit such a thing both seem a waste of time and
attacking the problem at the wrong end.
   Precise dot for dot erases are of course most
readably and simply done by simply setting the mode to
erase and re-executing the original write.

   Then you probably have a plasma panel problem.
The "erase threshold" is probably set too high. This
means that when the terminal cuts off voltage to a
wire pair on the panel, it doesn't cut the voltage
low enough to turn off all the dots.
   That is the case if writing the same text over
in mode erase does not work (and you're _sure_ it's the
same text.) Probably the most sensitive test for this is
the 'paused boxes' in testor.

The following code seems to do the job about as effectively
as it can be done in a quasi-block fashion:

define endin=n1,index=n2,place=n3,seggy(j)=n(3+j)
       segment,sgmnt=n4,6
calc   endin?19
       place?307
calc   seggy(1)?014040404640015001512

doto   1loop,index?1,endin
at     place+100*index
erase  sgmnt(index)
1loop

Of course, it doesn't adjust the margin as per "13.5",
but additional segmented variables could be inserted into
the code to handle that as well as other aspects. In a
"finished" lesson, the -calc- s into "seggy" could be
stored in a common, etc. It is both FAST and efficient.

The block erase feature of the new terminals is indeed

   The question is whether work should be invested in

encouraged to waste their time counting characters when
the "ulimate" solution is at hand (if not yet generally
available). There was much thought and work by a
number of people in the past few years with regard to
getting faster erasing and the implementation of the
block erase feature on the new terminals was the result.

   The answer to that one is yes, as one of our authors

some of his lessons depending on what packs they were on.
Recently some lessons changed packs by themselves, and
he found that he could no longer correlate the code of
the lesson wth the pack it was on! (inspect codes were
open so he could see the packs.)

The system does reserve the right to move the files around
on the packs for purposes of efficient management of our
growing database. It is not safe to rely on a file being
on a particular pack, although from experience changes
from pack to pack have been relatively infrequent.
Because of the potentially transient nature of the pack info
I doubt that it would be useful to include it in the
"accounts" database.

Also, normal backup procedures will not usually result in
the original file being moved to a different pack.

In answer to the question of why we need to know which pack
a lesson is on was demonstrated in the 'scope' problem. Out
of the 42 files effected 5 of them were our files. Before
we were informed of which files were involved two of us went
through 380+ different files by hadn. A process which took
half a day or so. We collect a list of which pack the files
were on for future reference. This information is probably
worthless now in case of future pack problems.

In addition, we need to rapidly know which if any of our
files would be involved in similar disasters so that data
was not stored into a trashed dataset and thus lost when a
backup was brought in.

We are in a very similar situation. Rather than search
through all of our files, I waited for the system
to search through all the files on Scope. I was
notified indirectly the next day that none of our files
were damaged except one that we found ourselves.(This
notification came only after I put an inquiry in Public
notes.)

In the near future, if an error like this occurs, I
may have to bring down our whole testing and record
keeping system until we locate all the damaged files.
Considering the somewhat blase¬e attitude on the part of the
system in notifying us, having an easy way to find
potential damaged file would help.

Schreiner and I just realized that there is a remarkably
simple way to get a -long 1- without the effect of the
force. The following code will accept a single key
only, but will not judge it until NEXT is pressed:
arrow ...
long  1
ok
judge key=next,continue,exit
...judging commands, etc.
Of course, if you have any -jkey-s, then you'll have to
test for them in the -judge-, also.?
I report this here, since I have never seen this little
trick before. Try it...you'll like it.

How about next time a system conversion is done changing
long 1 to long one, and in the future having
the tag 1 mean just plain long 1, and the tag one have
the effect of forcing judging.

Some other tag such as long 0 or long -1 might
be ok too.

        I would imagine that the -long 1- is generally
used when one wants to accept one key and begin judging.
In the cases where this is not so, the suggested code is
an acceptable, and not particularly kludgey, way to achieve
the desired effect.

        I suppose, at the time of implementation, you could
have argued either way on this point; but, now that the
-long- command is well-entrenched, it would seem impossible
to make any change.

An experiment shows that long -1 gives an execution
error now. That means that this tag (-1) could be used
to take care of the person who wants a long command that
doesn't force judging. No system changeover would
be necessary.

Alternatively the system could introduce some junky
code on those few long commands with variable tags
that would change the variable or expression to -1 if it
evaluated to 1, and then in the future long 1 would act just
like long 2, etc. The tag -1 would then replace 1.

long n3 $$old tag
long n3+2(n3=1) $$new tag supplied at system conversion.
*
long (alpha+beta=gamma) $$old tag
long (alpha+beta=gamma)+2((alpha+beta=gamma=1) $$new
*      tag after system conversion

The command -long 0- is a valid specification and is
useful in applications where you are using an arrow
which should only be -touch-able; the -long 0- prevents
the student from typing any keys, but DOES allow touch
input from the panel.

Wow, I wasn't trying to get this sort of discussion going!
I think it's probably true that most uses of -long 1-
benefit from the implied -force long-. The suggested
code is for the benefit of those few that want it the
other way. Let's not make a federal case out of it!

I don't think anyone is making "a federal case" out of it,
I think this just shows that there are a good number of
people who have run into the same problem that you have.
I agree that -long 1- is probably most useful the way
it is now. Rather than fooling around with exotic tags for
the -long- command to override the implied -force long-
in -long 1- , I think a much better solution would be a 
new tag for the -inhibit- command, -inhibit long-, which
would do the opposite of -force long-, that is, always to
require a press of a j-key to initiate judging. I also don't
think it's terribly important, since I get along just fine
with a setup like Professor Friedman suggested, but it
might slightly increase the readability of the code used
in such situations.

The uses of -long 0- are interesting. I got a question
on
long -3*(user=7author')

just yesterday, which allows non-authors only to press
NEXT.

Unfortunately, for this case -0 is not equal to 0, so
the above requires an abs(-3*(user='author')).

   This is the case only if each and every one of the five

is placed in a fixed position on the screen--no tolerable
way has been found to do the extra processing required to
compute a "proper" screen position for the arrow. This
is a point that people raise every so often; perhaps
the arrow could be dropped one line further still--but

problem is with a bad interaction between -force firsterase-
and -judge ignore-...both of which do some fancy things:
-force firsterase--causes the previous answer, "ok/no"
    judgement, and last answer-contingent write statement to
    be erased from screen
-judge ignore--causes the current answer (in a -long 1- case
   the current character) to be erased from the screen
The problem comes in when we try in the -long 1- case to
"wipe out" the character before it is ever sent out to the
terminal" this is done so that the display looks better
in that the student shouldn't see a fast flicker if we
actually sent out the character then immediately erased
it. This takes some fancy selective "wipe-ing out" of
information in buffers yet to be formatted...and that is
where an error occurs. A klude fix and interesting look
into the system can be obtained by inserting a -return-
just before the judge ignore

---------- response 4
  05/05/76     12.12     tenczar       s

so:

ok
return
judge   ignore

this -return- forces the system to finish the -force
firsterase- operation (properly) before going on to do the
-judge ignore- operation...and hence everything works out
properly.

should be running the government! And while one can
explain the problem, it is not at all clear how to fix it.

the "OK/NO" comes out before any answer-contingent
writing (things don't feel right if we don't do this...

Is it the usual practice of CERL to leave blank lesson

for almost two months that has a completely blank data page

unknown to me?

We know of some such spaces, Eventually we take them back,
but you would be surprised at how often we get a question
about where the space went from the person who had been
assigned the space and had left it unused for months.

Suggestion for an editor option:

From the block directory page pressing "I" (or something)
would initiate a "U" type search generaing an "index" in
the directory block with a format like (maybe):

*dumby      1-a
*preset   
*init       1-b
*intro
*keys
*imain
*tuder      1-c
*debug
*etc..

all unit names in the lesson with the associated part-block
numbers (until 1-a is filled of course). Also some method
of moving between blocks avoiding the block directory
would be nice. (cap B while in a block gives ¬6 1g) (?)

        You of course realize that you can generate a unit
index by using the lesson X search (X from the block Direc-
tory page) and searching for "unit____".

The I option is nice, for documentation's sake.
The B option, though, seems to be superfluous. One
could just as easily use the U option with a NEXT1 to
go to any unit you wanted. Would there be some
advantage as far as time used? There is no advantage 
as far as number of keypresses between backing out to
go to a block or using this proposed B option.

---------- response 8
  05/07/76     00.35     bowery       iowa

The advantage would be purely time. There would
be 3.5 keys presssed (shift=.5) to get from any block
to any other block. The problem is block directory
information plotting out, auto-catchuping etc.. gets
to be frustrating if you are a fast moving author.

---------- response 9
  05/07/76     14.10     putch       arizona

     Also, suppose you wanted to cancel your changes? If
you back out to the directory, you lose the use of the OUT
option. For example, suppose you make a major change in
block 1-a, and then back out to go to 4-g where you find
that you didn't want to make the 1-a change after all! You
now must waste a lot of time you could have used otherwise
getting backups! Clearly, something along the line of a
"B option" would be most beneficial.

I like the idea, too. I also would like to see some
sort of cross-index of units and variables. I take it
that these features are part of the lesson condensor,
so could some sysprog move the relevant parts into a
service lesson? Maybe one that could be run separate
from the editor, or maybe an option to see the listing
after a condense? Probably these suggstions are hard to
do (most likely), but they might cause some other,
more workable, suggestions.

        Notes are actually sent by the time you receive
the message "Last note sent to xxxxx of course yyyyyy".
To retract a note after it may possibly have been read
is not really a good idea, just like being able to
edit a note that has a response, in gnotes.

        Although I can't speak for Kim, I think that this
would involve several non-trivial changes in the -note-s
machinery. Perhaps it shouldn't be quite so easy to
send a note; maybe one extra keypress should be added to
the process to make one think twice about sending a

     First of all, the problem of deleting a note already
read shouldn't be a problem; simply make the ability to
delete a sent note dependent on the Notes flag still being
set. Second, the idea can't be too far out of line because
it is done exactly that way on the DEC-10. Third, the
ability to delete ill-considered pnotes that haven't been
read is as much a benefit to the receiver as it is to the
sender. After all, not many people enjoy stopping to read
pnotes because their flag is set, only to find that it is
only one note cancelling another!

The -erase- command can be confusing, because if you
say
at     1313
size   2
erase  4
the command will try to erase enough space so that 4
"size2" letters will be erased. And it _does_ work.

There have been various bugs with sized erasing in cases
where the erase went past the edge of the screen, etc.
I don't know if there are any bugs at the moment.

But for "normal" cases, -erase- is working fine.

Transmission errors that are related to humidity are the
result of bad lines (use of high quality components and
reasonable installation practices should eliminate such
problems). Whenever these problems occur, we want to know
so we can get the phone company to provide the quality of
service that you are paying for. Your report to repair
provides us with this information and is much appreciated.
        Usually, where large numbers of sites are having
the same problem, a system-wide message is posted.
However, if only one or two sites are having problems
a system-wide message can result in a site with unrelated
problems failing to notify us because they think everything
is being taken care of. Hence, we are very sparing of
use of such messages.

Also, the repair people can be phoned at 333-7466.
When it is a transmission problem, they often like to be
able to talk to you on the phone while simultaneously
looking at the terminal. So, in _addition_ to the report
in repair, you can phone.

the source is almost too long (10100 words). Frankly I
don't see how it could possibly be that long. The lesson
is 16 blocks long and -use-s 12 blocks, which makes a
total of 28 blocks. Even if each block was a full 322
word block completely full, that would make only 28?322 or
9016 words (and I know that most of the blocks are _not_
completely full). The lesson uses a 1-part charset, but
no common, leslist, or other little "extras". It seems
to me that I am condensing about 1500-2000 more words than
I should be. Where can it be coming from? Any suggestions?

I think that the "almost too long" message refers to
binary size, rather than source size. Also, if you have
use commands inside your used blocks, you may have more
source than you think.

The length of calcs or branches on the disc is different
from their condensed length, and the only way to determine
the condensed length is to condense the lesson.
A calc with a save length of 30 words might condense at
90 words.
A few other things look short, and condense long:
writec flub,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Over twenty words!
The last time I made a test, every null in a writec
tag was one word long in ecs.
writec flub-17,,Over twenty words! $$much shorter
Also, the condensed length of a lesson will vary with
what version of Plato is running.
And embedded at's and carriage returns condense the same
as regular at's and new line starts.
In general, commands which are calls for routines
are about as long condensed as on the disk:
do call
goto blazes $$about 4 words for 2 lines.

Calculations on "segmented" variables can greatly expand
the binary length of a lesson. A define set named "student"
remains as part of the binary, also -- I don't know how
much greater this can get to be. The commands silver men-
tions take 1 word apiece.

In other words, don't count on the lesson binary length
being the same as the source length. If the lesson con-
denses with a "warning" once, it might just as easily not
condense at all on another version of PLATO. Shorten it.

As an extreme example, defined functions can be used to
generate a 12,000 word binary from just one block of source
code. You need to be careful and put in -unit- commands
every 500 condensed words, and the result is rather useless,
but it is an example of "condensing". (hahaha)

If that's been ripped off, include whether it is an old

the bottom of the keyset, incidentally.

For the past two days, under various conditions and
in various programs/editing states, I have lost complete
usage of my keyset. It simply would NOT function--I
have sometimes heard "klicks", usually nothing (not even
an error light!).
   Needless to say, this is _very_ frustrating, especially
in the case that I might be talking to someone with no
way to let them know I've gone dead!
   Control comes back after a bit, sometimes just a few
seconds, usually a minute or two.

    I hope Indiana has set aside some time for keysets

if your keysetfails consistently after you have dropped it 3 inches, you can send it to silas warner for repairs,
dropping the keyset is not always a good idea. after all, you wouldn't drop your television if something failed in it,
would you? terminals and their accessories are considerably
more expensive than television sets. seriously, please do not attempt any do-it-yourself repairs until you have checked
with the maintenance group.

        Account directors can turn off the author creation
privilege of author signons in the account. He/She may
allow that author to set up his own account with the
constraint that the author cannot create other author
accounts within that "sub-account." Now, if this sub-account
director can create instructors, why are the instructor
options turned off? Why cannot the instructor options
be set such that they copy the restrictions imposed on

those authors cannot modify the course-editing flags of

Since instructor course-editing flags are initialized to

I learned something about the priority of operations today
that strikes me as being sort of unusual. I found that
a formulation like:

branch n1-(n1?n2),x,0equal,x $$where n2 is not equal to
* n1 before encountering this

always takes the branch to "0equal", because the computer
does the assign (n1?n2) before it evaluates the left-oper-
ator of the subtraction. That is the opposite of the way
I thought it should work, since I thought expressions were
evaluated from left to right and that subtraction had
higher priority than "assignment". What's more,

branch (n1?n1)-(n1?n2),x,0equal,x?
DOES do what I thought the other would. Could someone please
explain how operator precedence works in these cases?

The surprise guerra expresses is genuine if he has been
used to working on other types of computers. "Stack"
machines, especially, are usually set up to compile code
in a strict left-to-right order, since the operands can
simply be "pushed" onto the stack, and the operation is
then performed on whatever is "on the top" of the stack.
The CDC machine is a "register" machine with no hardware
stack. In this case, an operand is either a) a register
or b) an address (like the student bank). For your par-
ticular example, the compilation might go like this for the
subtract:?? 1) get two operands (returns either address or register)
          a) "n1" returns address? b) "(n1?n2)" returns register
  2) load both operands into registers (2ˆnˆd already there)
  3) perform operation.

In your case, a variable is changing values during
evaluation of the expression. We will NOT specify
whether the old or the new value is the one that is
used. We will NOT guarantee that it will continue
to execute the way it currently does.

Referencing a variable that changes value during
execution of an expression is an example of a poor

        Why did TUTOR support a marginally-useful feature
such as embedded assignments to begin with?=! In certain
cases, such as -writec-, using assignments for the express-
ion can create a huge mess. It seems that if the -writec-
autobreaks (as can supposedly happen if the tag gen-
erates a lot of output) it evaluates the expression AGAIN,
doing the assignment AGAIN. For an expression such
as (n1?n1+1), it could be the end of a beautiful relation
with PLATO. There are other examples, such as parameters

The present system of designating touch areas is atrocious.
So far I've seen three different methods which are all
equally confusing. Not only that but the two argument from

that "touch 1009,1" will pick up the four touch squares
around location 1009. However on my terminal it picks up
those four _and_ the two squares to the right. Talk about
adding injury to insult. (continued)

give a location within the touch square desired. A two
argument form would give two location that were diagonally
opposite corners of a rectangle. Then any touch squares
included in this rectangle would be indicated. What could
be easier. It could even be added to SD.

 I just noticed an error in the previous note.
"touch 1009,1" includes the 5 touch squares above and to
the right of the ones indicated in aids.

I agree. I wrote a similiar not long ago. Your

now used in -keytype- where you give the co-ordinates
of the lower left hand touch square and then the
number of spaces to the left you want and the number of
lines above it you want.

Along the same lines, why isn't it possible to include
t(  ) in the -group- command? Whenever I want to
make keys synonymous will touch boxes using a pause
loop, I have to make some kludge.

The latter situation is only part of the general problem
of equating touch areas and keys. As I understand it,
the solution lies in getting some space in the student
bank to store the necessary info.
As mentioned earlier, some folks like the keytype format
because it is not tied to the specs of a particular model
touch panel.

In regards to "touch 1009,1" there seems to be some
confusion between what Aids says and the way touch actually
works. The one argument touch has always worked the way it
does now. Essentially what happens is that the coarse grid
location 1009 is considered to be in the center touch box
and then the touch judges ˆ+=?- one boxes around this central
box, hence 9 boxes are included.

I will talk to the pso people about this. Eventually we
will get all the touch features standardized into some
reasonable system based on the plasma panel grids and not
the touch grid.

       Y
       Z
       pnt=(full)
       scalar,r,s=(-3000:3000)

Would condense the same as:

       segment,vertical,Y?1=n7,14,13,s
       segment,vertical,Z?1=n7,27,13,s
       X(xx)=X?1(xx+1)
       Y(xx)=Y?1(xx+1)
       Z(xx)=Z?1(xx+1)
       pnt(xx)=n(18+xx)
       r=n29
       segment,s?1=n30,13,s
       s=s?1(1)

On a future computer the same define set would generate
different explicit internal defines to accomidate
the size of the student bank, zbpw,..... etc..?whereas the above define set might be totally useless.
This would make problems like making functions, constants,

define sets academic.

The problem presented by this type of implicit definition
is that one does not easily find out where everything
is. This could be overcome by an editor option that could
convert between implicit and explicit structures.

It amazes me that anyone can learn tooter from scratch
nowadays, especially those who don't know much about
programming to start with. People keep suggesting changes
to make the language more elegant, yet which if implemented
would hopelessly confuse all but the professional. This
may be a good way to keep professionals employed, but is not
really the purpose of tutor. Ideally, everything should be
done to maintain the "hands on" qualities of tutor, whereby
a programmer can understand easily what his lesson is doing.
For example, judging in general, which causes new progs the
most trouble, is something that involves difficult concepts
and is not readily broken down to easily graspable bits,
unlike current defines. I also doubt the practicality of
converting back and forth between Bowery's style and the
one in common usage.

        Bowery means to imply that his proposed way
of defniinition would be treated as a subset of the present
structure. For people who like to keep track of what
variables are in use versus which are available, it
necessitates the use of some very condense-time consuming
methodology, and is not as satisfactory as it could be.
        Certainly you people at Cornell do not mean to
imply that his proposed structure would be any harder to
deal with than the present. If it is harder, then it
might be taught (or learned) AFTER the present - this is
the way that things tend to work now.

My suggested addition to the present define syntax would
not make any present define set in-operable. The added
features enable one to write a define set knowing fewer
rules than the present define set syntax. It would be
EASIER to learn because of the fewer rules. To show you
what I mean:

        as,symb(domain)=nvc(loc)(range)
<symb> is the only mandatory attribute for a variable.
as= array or scalar; symb= variable name;
domain= array index up and low bounds; nvc=n,v,nc,vc;
loc= location; range value up and low bounds

Thus the present syntax and the suggested syntax are not
two non-integrated entities. It is discouraging to have
thought out an idea as carefully as I have this and in
fact (mike b are you listening?) written code to see if it
would be practical on a systems level and have someone
make irresponsible responses based on ¬;4 seconds thought.

   Because of necessity to manage very small set of
variables, it is thought wise that author know where they
are. With autoassigned system, special rules are needed
for equivalences, commons etc. Don't think this approach
hasn't been discussed! Two years ago I was seriously
investigating a scheme which only needed special defines
for array domains or special types such as integer or
segments. All v-type variables would have been defined
when encountered in code. Ran into too many difficulties
to discuss here, so gave it up for now.
   There is no particular hassle with your elegant
nomenclature, but it would seem that it would insist on
making integers segments unless you specified elsewise,
thus making a default case use up extra cpu time? It
almost seems as if discussion is academic until other
machines are made which can run Tutor. At that point,
the defines will be asmall problem!

---------- response 8
  05/07/76     18.30     bowery       iowa

Well, academic or not, for the record the assumption that
integers would have to be segments is false unless there
was a need for room. The default atributes would be
        scalar,symb=n1(2?ˆzbpw-1??-1;2?ˆzbpw-1??-1)
Thus the a define set could start out like
define a,b,c,d
and have no loss of cpu time.
  There is nothing that would mandate segmenting
unless some range was imposed on the variable or array
explicitly.

I have no objections to Bowery writing such a feature
for himself and using it as a subset of the
present defines. However, I don't think that this
is the kind of thing that systems people should give
a lot of time to (unless it was part of a total

In comparing those lessons that bowery has written (quite
a few) to Mark's (ummm, I cant think of one...), I would
say that Bowery's points are much more valid as he is a
very much more experienced PLATO programmer. It is hard
to keep track of most variables and a system that aids the
inexperienced author in doing so, making it that the author
need not worry about unnecessary particulars (except of
course complex cases) is a great boon. I thought that
this was the goal of Tutor, to make it easy for people
that are not CS related...

Maybe so...

Bowery's scheme may/may not be useful for "ordinary"
programmer types--somebody with experience who is not
a systems programmer, say Stan Smith or Connie Curtin.
Those people know for sure what a "variable" is.

But I see gobs of people who barely know what a "variable"
is. They are the ones who suffer the most, and I think
that for them the very explicit writing down of
  numstu=n1
  probno=n2
is a very useful thing. It makes their work more concrete.

However, these same people still have trouble with
overlapping defines. We have a whole slew of new
authors around here from course "ll382", and over-
lapping defines rank second only to search state
interception of branches as a major cause of frus-
tration.

Example:
        probno=n1
        score=v1
        ...

Even worse is the case where they have to use arrays
(a recent example was a finance lesson that was draw-
ing a bunch of weird randomly-generated graphs that
the student would later be quizzed on). Figuring out
where in God's gray student bank that array ends is
often very difficult for an untrained mind. And of
course, a segmented array can give one the heebiejeebies
keeping track of it.

Interestingly enough, this all goes back to the point of
making the program easy to follow. As long as we have
the current define structure, the integrity of a defined
variable is ALWAYS suspect. One can never be sure that
=glorp= has remained unchanged between lines 22 and 42
simply because it hasn't been referenced. The chain
reaction from an overlapping define can often be as
destructive as that of a blown atomic reactor, without
the attendant visibility.

---------- response 15
  05/08/76     20.32     dave fuller       uimc

         Absolutely. The people that are trying to defend
their stance by saying "but gork=n1 is so much more under-
standable" do not see the possible fact that this might
be a boon to programmers. There is no law that details
the features that a beginner must use. It seems to me
that there are many people in first-semester CS classes
that use declaration structures not unlike Bowery's
suggestion with great ease. I don't think the somewhat
blindly horrified expressions that Jim is getting are
deserved.

---------- response 16
  05/08/76     20.43     dave fuller       uimc

        It also seems to me that the structure of such an
addition could be much more understandable than what now
has to be dealt with. There would be implicit declaration
delimiters to allow integer or floating vars, and maybe
even something as hog wild as being able to specicy the
desired bounds for a segment, and having the system make
the decision as to how long it should be. Don Shirer has
already made some very elegant additions to tutor, with
his arrays, and the general form of their allocation and
use. Certainly, all that Jim says has been done many
times before with different languages.
        All in all, Jim Bowery's suggestions are not really
meant for a "next week" implementation. The essence of
PLATO being evolutionary, and responsive to the needs of
its users, I would venture to guess that this input we're
giving will be remembered by the people who make the de-
cisions.

   Since no one else has bothered to re-state the
basics of this case again, I guess I'll take the time.
We have a problem in that the "jobs" we run are ones
that can be interrupted and resumed on some other day
many times over the course of a semester. A compiler
that "randomly" assigned variables would be a disaster
under these circumstances; our choice has been to "pin"
variables specifically to locations by the current
technique. Various less rigorous possibilities have
been considered over the years and perhaps something
somewhat freer will be implemented some day. Meanwhile
another possibility might be to provide the ability to
check at condense time for overlapping definitions--this
would help find the most frequent types of problems.

If the proposed define structure behaved in such a way that

define i=n,j,k,l
        etc...
  when changed to
define i=n,j,k,l,m
        etc...

  had the effect of re-positioning everything in the "etc."
  part of the define set, then I don't like it.

It is also true that often it serves a useful purpose to
define the same location in several different ways, e.g.,

vtype=v1,ntype=n1
zroseg=n11, segment,seg=n11,1 $$ allows "calc zroseg?0"
...
so if overlapping defines are ever checked by the condensor,
I hope no error or warning that can't be shut off is
generated.

What Blomme proposed is NOT what I proposed.

I proposed making it so that if one wanted to overlap one
would have to explicitly ask for such an overlap. Otherwise
no overlap would be allowed. eg:

define  a=n1,b,c,d
        e=n2,f,g,h

I have decided to write and publish a -define- generator
myself since the system's staff does not feel it is worth
their while. If it is not usable or not used then I will
be shown to be wrong.

   I did not propose any change to the compiler, merely
pointed out why we cannot have a "standard" one which
picks its own storage assignment.
   As far as warnings re overlap, obviously the current
structure sometimes nearly requires that defines be
overlapped, so such a facility would seem most appropriate
if invocable up on user request.

The ¬W0 and ¬W1 features will not go away unless some

they may change form; that is why the feature is not
yet "announced".

Let us say that "backwards" writing is most likely here
to stay. I have not heard any mention of an embedded
form. The embedded commands actually stick "commands"
into the write string. The shifts between frontwards
and backwards writing would just be done with special
character codes _within_ the write string.

As for making it more "obvious", the current setup is
MICRO-CR to start a backwards writing line, and
MICRO-L (left) and MICRO-R (right) to change directions
within a line of writing.

   Is this some sort of joke? If so, this is not an
appropriate place for taking up space and other people's
time. If not, then simply notice that the open command
stores the characters in the judge buffer starting at n1
and the following close then retrieves them and puts them
right back--therefore nothing observable happens. The
close and loada commands are intended as means for
people to load the judging buffer with their own
character strings to be judged--as I feel sure aids
explains.

   The close command takes characters (one per word)
FROM student variables and puts them into TUTOR's
internal judging buffer. You naturally cannot "see"
this except as a result of the judging which follows
(or by storing the contents of the judging buffer--
as with a storea).

         Did the system responses to this note really have
to take the tone they did? This isn't the first time
I've seen someone tripped up by the "judging buffer", or
even by a command description in AIDS. Anyone who doesn't
want to "waste his time" responding to a person's request
for help can easily keypress his way past the note. If
one doesn't understand the person's problem, then one
can ask for a clarification, or say nothing. But there is
no reason for such ill-temper, especially from systems
personnel.

Mike,

All of us sometimes have trouble recognizing real requests
for help, especially when all the original note gives is
a piece of code and some indications of frustration. The
original note in this case was such that Rick could not
tell that it was a real request for help, and he said so.
However, he also took the time to try to answer what he
thought was the problem. You may notice he spent most of
his note trying to do that, and he did take the time to
try to help. i admit, his reply would have been better
without the first two lines, but we are all human.

I have experienced the same difficulty with accuracy and

a curious example where
.400000000 # 10 = 4.0000000001

---------- response 3
  05/08/76     22.58     danny       research

_OCTAL_ .3146 is correctly rounded to .32
Therefore, 11.1 is being rounded correctly, and 111/10 is
not. There are two machine instructions for division.
One rounds, the other does not. Apparantly the two
above cases are being done by different types of divides.
( Frankly, you have no right to expect two expressions
which mathematically give exactly the same result to give
exactly the same computational result. The number of bits
per word is finite, and you just have to learn to live with
it. )

One might point out that which way it rounds to is
an arbitrary choice each of which is equally correct.

In other words the amount of correctness lost is zero
if the result is unpredictable.

If you want the round to be in a particular direction
you can add a very small amount or subtract a very small
amount before rounding.

     The entire -use-d file is brought in from the disk,
just as the entire lesson is read in one read when being

One of the parameters on which it would be helpful to

a given student and/or lesson. Although this is
recognized to be important and most of us have a
pretty good idea where disk accesses occur, it would
be nice to have that statistic kept with a given
record, or available within a lesson. If this is
already kept or easily kept, making it available would
aid in the evaluation of whether some uses of
PLATO are feasible and should be expected to continue
to be supported.

There are several limitations on the area data collection
reserved words. None of the counters except *atime* can
go over 511 (*aarrows*, *asno*, etc.). Although *atime*
gives you the time spent in an area in milliseconds, it
is correct only to about 1/10 second. It would indeed
be appropriate for this information to be included in
AIDS (it doesn't seem to be there.)

It is not easily possible to increase the range of these
counters, since the amount of space available to the
system for keeping them is limited. Yours is the first
case I've heard of where the 511 limit is a problem.

Last week I was discussing the topic of security on the
plato system with a friend, and it was my understanding that
it would be possible to write a password-breaking program
which rapidly tries various permutations of characters until
the correct one is found. This started me thinking about
the number of passwords that could be written, and for what
it is worth here is what I came up with:
The different characters which can be used in writing a
password include: 26 letters, 10 numerals, 1 shift, 4 arith-
metic operators, 1 sup, 1 sub, plus ,./; and ? for a total
of 48 possible character codes. Since a password can con-
tain opto 10 characters, the number of permutations possible
is:
  ? --------======?ˆ48!??====??(48-n)! ?ˆ where n varies 1¬D10.

I calculate this to be about 2.5 ? 10ˆ1ˆ6 possible passwords.

It is incredible that one would worry about a method like
this to break security codes.

Besides.. you don't want "permutations" of the codes..
you want combinations. The number of combinations
for security codes is ¬64ˆ1ˆ0.

If one had a routed student or something being driven
from a router lesson that pressed keys at a rate of
2/second, one would need about (64?ˆ10??/2)?5 keys to be
pressed assuming that you only had to try 1/2 of the
combinations and that the average number of keys in a
combination was 5. Thus you would need about
(64?ˆ10??/2)?5/2 seconds OR 4.5667?10ˆ1ˆ0 years to get an
'average' password.

Well, first of all, if you're talking about your PLATO
sign-on password, you have absolutely nothing to worry
about, since such a program would have to press keys on
another terminal that was not already signed in, and no
program in an ordinary TUTOR lesson can do something like
that. However, there are some commands, like -readset- and
-dataset- that can compare a programmer-specified alphanum-
eric with a security code. Now, it would be possible to
write a program that looped through all possible alphanum-
erics and compared it with a security code, in order to try
to figure out the change code to your course (or something
like that), but unless your course is unfortunate enough
to have 'a' or something similar for a change code, the
chances of such a program actually succeeding are virtually
nill. Such a program would autobreak so badly, due to the
excessive number of disk accesses and

I just noticed that I forgot to include the 'space' code in

that could be used in passwords.
Taking this into account, there are more like 3 ? 10ˆ1ˆ6
possible passwords which do not use any character more than
once.
Oh yes, in answer to bowery's point about combinations and
permutations--you _do_ calculate _permutations_ in this case.
Combinations take into account only the way things can be
grouped _without_ considering their order. Since the order
of characters in a password is important one must calculate
the number or _permutations_.

If you really wanted to play the "crack the password" game
you would interface a mini or micro computer to the keyset
connector and let it generate those permutations or
combinations at a rate of close to 10 keys a sec. This would
still take a long time but we have had dedicated Nasties
on the system in the past. If you couldn't afford a computer

To answer once and for all to the pseudo-statisticians,
the number of possible passwords typeable on this system,
assuming 10 "characters" (actually six-bit codes) per
password maximum, is
??        ?==??i??=??1==¬=ˆˆ1ˆˆ0 63ˆi =¬n 1.00082?10ˆ1ˆ8.

I really get upset when someone makes insinuations about
knowing all kinds of cute ways to breach system security.
Certain people seem to be having quite an ego trip dropping
all kinds of hints about "I know something you don't know",
but what's a minor boost to the ego to some people is a
matter of deepest concern to me. First of all, in antici-
pation of the stream of responses calling me "paranoid",
let me preface this by saying I can't afford not to be
paranoid. The project I'm working on involves storing
student records on PLATO. This includes grades, GPAs,
addresses and phone numbers--the whole schmeer. These
students have a right to their privacy. If I had reason
to beleive that "anyone can get passwords", as certain
people have implied, then there would be serious doubts
about the continued use of PLATO for this purpose. Now,
I want the truth: how vulnerable are we?

I am not trying to have an ego trip. I am telling people
that PLATO security is not the impregnable fortress some
people think it is. However, it is about as secure as any
onteractive computer system can be. I have discovered
two flaws in system security myself, both of which I 
reported and have now been corrected. I will NOT go into
details about them; you can ask Bill Golden. The point
is, there may very well be more.
The safest way to protect your private data is by hashing,
and protecting access from programs by signon checking
with _no_ partial access. But even this would not guarantee
safety. And always remember, a systems person can read
anything. (No, that is not an accusation.)

But I wonder what the percentages are:

  Passwords broken by inputting all possible combinations,
system security loopholes, etc.

vs.

1) Using an short, OBVIOUS password
2) Telling others the password
3) Not caring WHO peers over your shoulder
   (Yes, Virginia, keypresses can be remembered!)
ad infinitum..

       So I think the point is that the system, while
not perfect, is MUCH more secure than it's human users.
So, PROBABLY, the next security problem you have will be
of your own doing.

*sigh* I must admit that my mind boggled somewhat at frye's
comment about "pseudo statisticians".
Let me explain it this way--suppose there were only 3 pos-
sible characters (a,b, and c) and the password could be
only 1 or 2 characters long. According to frye/mfl, there
would be 3ˆ1+3ˆ2=12 "passwords".
Well, count 'em:
a,b,c,ab,ac,ba,bc,ca,cb
in other words, there actually are: [3!=(3-1)]+[3!=(3-2)]=9
"passwords" which do not use the same character twice.

By the way, Dave Anderer makes some very good points; if
you want a reasonably secure password, for God's sake don't
make it only 3 or so characters long and at the same time 
pick something obvious such as your initials or nickname.
You would do much better to use 8-10 characters and pick
at least _two_ items (e.g. your initials _and_ your wife's
nickname) and connect them together with a * or something.

        Why does one want combinations rather than permuta-
tions? A password is an ordered set.
        Also, while the number of available characters and
the number of chars/password does make the problem of sys-
tematic attempts to break a password rather academic for
PLATO, it has not been so for the field in general. I'd
have to really dig to find the cases I was reading about,
but there have been a few important problems in the last
few years with users/employees writing just such security-
breaking programs and succeeding, with predictably unfor-
tunate results for those interested in limiting the access
to various materials.

P.S. When one considers the limited number of characters

     I have a feeling that a shift lock was not included

A lot of people have trouble getting use to letting the
SHIFT key go when typing a space as it is--can you imagine

of time. I got here just as the system went down for
45 minutes. Even a recording saying "Plato crashed and
is expected to return at 0100" would be fine...it would
also save gas and time for many individuals.
     2. How about some character space after each variable
listing in common so different variables can be identified
while inspecting common? The space could be provided by
eating up common space, if that's possible. If not, then
maybe space could be weaseled out of somewhere else in the
lesson. It would sure be nice, I don't always have my notes

   My sympathies. Having worked remote before, all I
can say is to call the repair people at 333-7466  during
the day. They are the ONLY people to call, as they know
when/where/who/why to call in the phone menagery if it's

The most frustrating thing is that most of these line
troubles can be traced only while they are in effect.
Hence, if you are having problems during normal working
hours, make sure to get thru to the maintenance people
(by phone if necessary) so they can contact the phone
company immediately. The maintenance group seem to have
developed contacts within the various nooks and crannies
of the Bell and (shudder) General System that actually
permits them to get things done. Chances of someone else
trying to get the same response in reasonable time are
slim.

    (217) 333-7466 is the number to get things done.
If you call the operator, we can check to see if you are
getting line errors, but you know that already. We can
see if something is wrong with the site controller, but
in the past 8 months, I've never found that to be the
problem. Only the maintenance people can get the tele-
communications system back in order.

How about modifying the define command to allow matrices

    Such as:

define segment,vertical,arrname(x,n)=n1,startbit,bitlength

Thus the variable arrname(3,6) would be equivalent to the

exploring ways to increase revenue through increased
utilization of the PLATO facility in ways that will not

Several thoughts have been to charge students and

outside users (e.g., educational institutions in the
area, local Civil Air Patrol, etc.).

We would appreciate any insights into:

True, but how many commons have no codewords? The point

by some villain, but it is less likely to be found than
the change code (which is entered much more often). And
since common may be changed with merely the change code.

who is currently editing because everyone in the lesson
accessing it would have to listed, that could be quite a
list to drag around. Even if this were the case and you
could somehow update the last editor info each time the

You don't seem to understand. What the problem is is
that the common codeword is HARD to get, since it is not
entered so often. The change code IS entered often, and
is therefore easier to get. I am not asking that those
lessons that access common should update 'last edited'
info, just when the system common editor is used to
edit common. Anyone who has the change code to a lesson
can edit common without leaving a trace. This should
not be the case, since the system editor can do VERY
extensive damage to common, whereas a lesson that accesses
common must 'know' the common code, and I think that
it is very unlikely that someone other than the owner
of the common (and trusted associates) would have the
common code.

i just tested this but maybe i am missing something too:
*
the only way a condensed lesson can change the common
of another lesson is to match the _common_ code word
of the lesson the common is in. matching the _change_
code word alone gives the message " common codeword
protected" when one tries to attach the common to 
the other lesson.
*
there is then a distinction between changing a 
common from an editor program condensed "outside" of
the TUTOR editor (requires COMMON codeword) and
making changes from the TUTOR editor within the
common block itself (requires only the CHANGE code
of the lesson).
*
without passing on the merits of the issue, couldn't one
say the original question is valid?

(1) Yes, we could mark the time of last edit for a
  common when done via the system provided common editor.
(2) There is a difference from marking source text changes
  since text blocks are basically changeable only via
  the system editor.

   So: perhaps we will one day mark the edit time on
common blocks, but that time can NOT be taken as the
last time the common was changed! It might tend to
be confusing for some authors who would assume that
the last time their common was changed was indicated
by the date/time listed, whereas that info would
reflect only the last time the system common editor was
used to change the common--not the last time the common
was actually changed (presumably changes to common via
lessons which use it are far more frequent).

If the date ¬+ time the common was returned to disk was

Of course, there would perhaps be some times when the common

And for manipulating large volumes of data that's
already stored. there is always "dsedit". My utility
routines allow multiple record zero/copy (yes, you
CAN copy between two datasets (different record sizes
you say? sure!) or intra-dataset copying). And of course
you can inspect/change anything in your dataset, or search
for a specific item with a X-search style search mechanism.

If a site is near or over its allotment and a student needs
ECS, authors are deleted until enough space has been found.
Authors are deleted as they are found, rather than according
to any formula. No deletions occur if the director of the
logical site sets a flag prohibiting deletions.

  One more for the how about department...random number
division. How about a new form of -randu- that would
give a random number between two fixed points. Example:

randu n1,num1,num2 $$ where num1 is lower limit and
                   $$ num2 is upper limit.

  As it is now, if you want to simulate this, it takes
quite a bit of work, so would this be a possibility
or is there something allready around that will do
the job for me. I seem to dimly recall something

I'm not sure, but it is conceivable that you can charge
it to the telephone company if it is indeed necessitated
by something that is their fault. Check with your business
office.

Unfortunately, calling by phone during non-office hours
will not help since the maintenance people are here only
during those hours (the rest of the time they are out in
the hinterlands installing terminals). The maintenance
people are the only ones who can cut through the red tape
with Ma Bell to get line problems traced while they are
still happening. If problems aren't looked for then, they
normally can't be found at all.
Sooo....report the problem in "repair" (if you can) and
get someone who can afford the call to do so during office
hours the next time your terminal starts acting like a
traffic signal. The "repair" report will alert the
maintenance people and they will be waiting for your call
to start the tracing procedures.

  Should you have phone line problems during the evening

continue, call your local phone company and report the
problem of excessive errors. Where the Plato equipment
terminates with the telephone company phone line should
be a trouble number that you can call them at.It is possible
that if your diagnosis is wrong, you will get a bill for
the trouble shooting the telephone company has done. We
have found that a large percentage of trouble clears it

perhaps it's worth mentioning that when the line errors
occur ONLY in conjunction with pressing keys (that
is to say there are no errors when text is being
plotted from a program origin, but there are
errors when keys are echoed), a special problem
exists which can sometimes be ameliorated by
an adjustment. i don't want to promote do it yourself
terminal tweaking so i won't say more about it
here --if you have this problem, i am sure that 
the repair people can tell you how to deal with it.

The new instructor mode options (yes/no features) are
excellent, but it may be necessary to devise a special
key press which will activate what most site directors
feel is useful for nearly all instructors.
The problem with the current system will be that site
directors who have many class users (e.g. Kennedy-King
with something like 70 courses) will be spending an
incredible amount of extra time at the beginning of
a semester getting instructor mode options set up

Seeing as how it's prime time, and considering that

the following two phenomena?

        * The condense queue is unusually long
        * The system has been EXTREMELY slow all
          day long.

For example, I pressed SHIFT-DATA to change my security
code while inspecting a lesson; I got a blank screen,
and only SHIFT-STOP got me to the "enter your security

Such things are prevalent during periods of high CPU usage

much during prime time, you would have noticed this

Have a form of the -term- command that works similar to the
-keytype- command (-termt- or -tterm- or something of the
like.) This would make checking for terms much easier and
less bulky than with the -edit- buffer that is now necessary
for such a procedure. The form would be something like:

tterm n1,term0,term1,term2,term3,........etc.

The variable n1 become 0 if the unit is entered by

have planned for some time to make available a system
defined name (say "zterm") which will contain the

to remove that incredible patch that used the edit
buffer to store such information. Maybe we could also
make the edit key operational when you press TERM--without
destroying or touching the edit buffer in effect in your
lesson. Having the EDIT key operable would be especially
useful when you are being monitored and can write a full
line after pressing TERM.

        To go back to an old suggestion:
        There are various commons around that are intended
as 'read-only' commons, accessable as such by various members of a user-group.
        It would seem logical to allow the person in charge
of the common to enforce its read-only status, and the way 
to do this is by allowing for both a common-inspect codeword 
and a common-change one.

Read-only access is also usefull to datasets and leslists. 

It also seems fitting that one be able to completely 
restrict the use of linesets, charsets, and microtables
from those without the proper codeword.

An "inspect common" codeword and an "access microtable/
charset/lineset" codeword would be usefull.

While I'm not so sure that I'm just opening another can
of worms:
I think we are heading towards more of a 'name-check'
security system rather than a 'codeword-check' system.
Hence, in the future I would expect a person in charge of 
a dataset or common to be able to specify those lessons 
which may access that dataset or common, and specify what
type of access those lessons may have. This is analogous to
the security system that David Woolley has developed with 
Group Notes, and seems to be much more secure than any 
codeword based system.

Nate, it's easy to check to see if someone has tried to 
jumpout to some particular unit of your lesson by making 
a simple test in the ieu of the lesson. (See lesson
[although I sorta hate to mention it here ... ] klass
for an example of this.) I think the jumpout codeword
should be eliminated for this reason.

Kim, it is my impression that we are heading AWAY from
name and course checks - I was surprised when the new 
notes mechanism worked that way - because signons are 
so fluid, and we are supposed to be trying to make material
transferrable between systems. It seems that codewords
are the best way to do that.

Problem with original suggestion: we have enough codewords
as it is, and separate dataset and leslist codewords
should probably have higher priority.

Mike: I fail to see the connection between system transfer-
ability and the proposed name/course access system. The 
owner of a lesson is the final arbiter of by whom his/her
lessons will be used anyway. Now, if the lesson is "sold"
I'm sure it would be a relatively simple matter to zap
that portion of the lesson directory which contained the 
access info. Perhaps you could clarify for me.
(PS: I also am very fond of jumpout codewords--in lieu of 
a better security system, they aid me in exercising my 
right to control access to my lessons where necessary.)

You could spend an AWFUL lot of space in a file just storing

file--especially in a "library" type lesson, like 
"cslibrary", where the list would be very large.

But the need for the ability to specify read-only access

we need read-only as well as read-write code words.?

In Re to the last common change issue. I think that one
possibility that was mentioned in notes is a good way:

1) Date changed when common editor used.
2) Date not changed when under lesson control.

I think this in combination with one other new feature it 
could be a important,useful feature: 

3) Way to tie lesson to common in such a way that no other 
   lesson can change the common, and the connection can 
   not be changed without changing the last changed date.
The purpose of this would be to have a survey record which
could not be tampered with via ordinary means. (Ignoring
the fact that security on ANY computer system is suspect)

A way to proof survey information by examining the program,
the last date changed, and inspecting the common will be?needed one of these days.

In respect to the lesson-common tie, the common would have
to be zero by the act of making the connection and setting
the date. The sealed program would then contain any

I fully agree. Commons and datasets are often vital portions
of a lesson. Their security should not be entrusted in
a "codeword" which may at any time be breached. I look
forward to the day when something like Woolley's scheme
in groupnotes (see replies to previous note) is
implemented for commons, etc. Until that day, it would
be very nice if the editor displayed the last time
a common was edited using the system editor.

I would assume that the method that they would use for
the "Access Control Lists" (implemented on many other
systems alread) would be similar to a charset/lineset
microtable etc. (ACLsets?) possibly stored in the first
block (the one that is used for the directory) and any
blocks following (depending upon how many signons are
needed to be entered). The ACLset could be used from
(not -use-d folks) any other lesson and also could be
the set used for gnotes. This would greatly reduce the
amount of disk/ECS needed for the ACLset and would ease
the control of an entire series of files.

to keep its own information -- the information that is
at a level above the lesson level. What would we call

time of entering a lesson to the time we leave the lesson?

This may be in the realm of the "Somebody please protect me

sure that any saves have been returned to disk before
deleting the original. The save buffer can be lost through
a thoughtless keypress here or there, not to mention a
system crash. This would seem to be an encouragement to
skip this, and possibly create an unfounded reliance on
the save buffer by new and inexperienced authors.

Now that the above is out of the way, I can understand your
request, as there are many times that I would rather risk
it for a minor code transfer than to come back and delete.
However, S¬$ (or A¬$) followed by D¬$ isn't all that many

        I think a better idea would be the once-suggested
SU and DU commands, which would save a unit and delete a
unit, respectively. Also, you would want an AU to
append a whole unit. The unit acted upon would be the
one with the -unit- command on the first line of the

        I certainly always transfer before I delete an
important piece of code. I don't think the convenience
is worth the risk at all. Also, the message that informs
you that you have saved "xx words" is to protect you from
deleting something BEFORE you _know_ it has been saved.
Since nothing dramatic happend externally when you
_S_ave a line, it's good to be informed that something

The other side of the slip of the finger problem is
being sure to delete the same number of lines which one
previously saved.

How about a DS (or maybe named DN) option which deletes the
same number of lines as are currently in the save buffer?

The use would be as follows:

1) Save n lines starting at line: "Delete this mess..."

2) Insert save at any point one chooses.

3) DS (or DN) starting at line: "Delete this mess..."

I suspect that line errors are causing these messages to
not erase properly at night when no one is around here,
and the down display's might stay on (along with the red
light) for many hours. Would someone please
send STOP (to turn off the red light) and a full screen
erase whenever the system comes back up to prevent this.

Can't you just turn the terminals off when no one is
around? It should not affect any of the newer terminals
(serial numbers greater than 64, I think).

Is there some reason why the terminals are left on over
night? They use a substantial amount of power which could
be saved by turning them off (as well as avoiding problems
like this). I may be mistaken but I believe clear signals
are already being sent with each tape message so you may be
being plagued by line problems as well. Al Avner

this is with TLC from the author trying to get it to

CS 196 (and its predecesor, CS 109) is and always has
been described simply as "Honors in CS". The idea of
the course is to be something extra given simultaneously
with the other 100-level (introductory) CS courses.
The content of the course has always been up to the
instructor. It just happens that, as members of the CS
faculty got into Plato usage, they chose to do Plato
things with CS 196. This fall, Prof. Watanabe prefers not
to use Plato. Who knows what will happen with the course
next spring--it will be up to whoever teaches it that

You guessed it, NO NOTES. Yesterday it happened when

Fear not for your sanity--When you read a new note, PLATO
makes a note to itself to switch off your note flag (and
does so on a temporary basis as long as you are on the
system). When you sign out in the usual fashion, it then
turns the note flag off permanently. However, if a crash
occurs, PLATO doesn't get a chance to make the permanent
change to your records and you see the flag again when
you return to the resurected system. Note deletions are
done as they are made so the note originally causing the
flag to be set may not be there if you deleted it before the
crash.

         Well, I still have my sanity wrapped up in a

couldn't have caused this one, because prior to the
crash, I had been off for awhile, and came back on the
system, with a _clean_ note flag. It would seem to me that
the action you speak of is done at the lastest at signoff,
right? Don't get me wrong, I accept your explaination
if that were the case, as it has happened to me before
many times. But this just wasn't the case....

-judge exit- is what is causing your problems. It restores
the original judging copy, thus destroying your attempt to
add the 071. This is, I might add, a difficult problem to
solve -¬=-¬=- the adding or removing (or otherwise altering) of

         Another way to do what you are trying to do
is use a micro table and a force micro at the arrow.
This allows you to put NEXT to CR. I have used this
in a notesfile sort of thing and think that calcnotes
used this idea. Other than that it is very difficult
as Dave says to alter the judge buffer while still
allowing student input. There may be security problems
in allowing this, i.e. something getting into the buffer
that shouldn't be there.

Recent improvements in the error checking and character

These errors should be corrected now that they are being

You should _always_ consider both the line just-before and
the line just-after the flagged line when you have a
condense error that you can't explain. It can happen that
an error in one line causes a 2nd line to appear wrong.

A very simple case which causes confusing condense
errors is an omitted -write-:

unit  test

      that was a nice unit $$ causes error in -do george-
unit  george

It seems that right now the -data- command (and the other

*baseu* if the unit you go to is the unit you're in. In
other words, pressing DATA in unit "zap":

base
unit zap
data zap

does not set *baseu*. This is convenient if you want DATA
to be used for replotting the page or some such thing, but

One of the Plato projects I work with keeps student scores 
in each student's records, and uses a utility routine to
transfer them to common in an easily readable format. The 
project also uses datafiles to keep track of errors and
certain other operational data. The teachers for this 
course are not Plato-oriented, and so learning the in's
and out's of lesson names, print requests, security codes, 
etc., would be quite difficult for them.

The ability to request lesson prints (exactly like SHIFT-P
from the Author Mode page) and zero datafiles from inside
a lesson would allow this process to be automated, thus
freeing teachers from the responsiblity of learning all
of this.

Is there any possibility of these things being implemented?

In the interest of debugging code, it would be very nice 
to be able to have a command which would "interrupt" the 
condensor so that what would normally condense as one
command could condense into two commands. For example,
since -calc-, -doto-, -branch-, and statement labels all
condense into a -calc- statement, one could do:

calc  n1?15
break $$ start a new command now ¬X¬X
doto  1end,n2?1,10
      branch n2=n3,1out,x
1end
break $$ start another new command
1out

and have the above condense as 3 commands rather than 1, 
as it currently does (without the proposed -break- command).

   You could use the return command in the example you
have. Calculations are somewhat optimized by gathering
them all together into one command whenever possible
and we will not be spending any time providing something

   block of common.

2) Each time you changed a define (even if only

Recently, I have heavily used the copy-a-character option
in the charset editor. I have noticed that when you attempt 
to copy into a character that already exists the system
will verify that this is what you really want to do.
It would be a great time and labor saver if the charset 
editor would display the character to be overwritten. This 
would allow better verification in cases such as this. At
the present time, the only way to verify what character you 
will overwrite is to examine the character in one of the 
other options. 

This minor change to the charset editor would be of 
great benefit to all authors.

Upon looking in AIDS at the -array- feature, in the discus-
sion in array operators (dot, cross pruducts, etc.) it says
that long chains of commands may not produce correct results
as some of these require temporary storage and if the calculation
is auto-broken this can garbage the results. This can only
be judged as wrong. If the system cannot guarantee the
results of a command or calculation then what good
is having it available? On a computer system, the system itself
is responsible for maintaining the integrety of its result
if the calculations given it to evaluate are meaningful.
It does me little good to know that I can express in TUTOR
A?B¬?C¬?D if I cannot be guaranteed that I will get the same
results on two different tries. This "feature" should
either be made non-autobreakable or removed if TUTOR is to
be regarded a language to do other than trivial programming

PLATO-TUTOR is a _developing_ system, not (and probably never)
a finished one. It used to be that the regular -calc-
command had timeslice problems. That did  not prevent it
from being extremely useful. In due course, the problem
was removed. Similarly, judging used to have time-slice
problems that required extra care on the part of the
programer. That problem was also removed. If your logic
were followed, the array commands would not yet be releasd
at all. The philosophy of this system does not follow
that logic. The array commands are known to be useful
in their present form, so they are released and used.
That way, experience is gathered which cannot be gained
in an armchair. Presumably the time-slice problems with
array will eventually be fixed, but even if they aren't
the commands are useful. Just use a little extra care,
that's all.

This seems to be a frequent misinterpretation. At the time
your institution got access to PLATO, it was carefully
explained to your representative that this implementation
of PLATO was an experimental rather than "production"
facility designed to gather design data in a realistic
setting. To as great an extent as possible, the system
acts like a production facility (in order to insure that
"realistic setting"). Features available and reliability
actually exceed that of some so-called production CAI
installations. When new features become available, they
are released as early as possible to permit user inputs
prior to freezing their design. The AIDS documentation
was intended to give the full truth while allowing you
to test and comment on this expanded capability.

Dear fellow Hoosier:
   At the time the array features were released last
summer, it was carefully explained in lesson "array"
that they were not complete and that more features would
be added. It IS intended to make these autobreakable, but
there are major problems to be solved, like, where do
we get space for storing arrays of intermediate results
if you are autobroken in the middle of an array multiply?
I will be working on these problems, among others, this
summer, so pleases be patient. During the school year I
get paid for teaching other Indian-ans, not programming.
If you still feel irritated because Pangloss' promised

does the writer of the note propose that any CAI
language which doesn't handle vector cross-products
is trivial? if so, he hasn't recently examined any
of the other "trivial" systems--most of which have
neither graphics, nor any reasonable way of dealing
with student responses.
*
however, this problem is probably due ot the sequence
and manner of description of the new features--in which
the description is first, followed by the qualifications.
if the item were presented with a preface saying something
like: this feature is developmental only--it should
not be used in programs which must work consistently but
can be employed for experimentation... then maybe
the expectations would be more reasonable.

    I had thought that the case was simply that one
must live with the restriction of one vector operation
per line. I didn't think the feature was "experimental"
but rather just not completed in the most elegant final
fashion. If this is indeed the case (I hope Don Shirer
or someone else who is absolutely positive of the facts
will confirm this), then there is no reason whatever
to avoid using these nice capabilities, but only to use
an extra line or two (where one may in the future be able
to use only one).

when you continued the tag of your answer command, you

the specific error the condensor is objecting to: is that
a phares cannot go over one line.
However, your use of phrase (words connected by "*") just
can't be helping you a lot...TUTOR phrases were meant to
indicate that several words have the same meaning as one
word, e.g., mary jane = marijuana. Indeed, the use of
phrase was primarilly meant to allow these "several word
wasy" of saying things to be made synonymous with "one word
way" of saying things.

        answer (marijuana,mary*jane)

you will seldom want to use the phrase option in TUTOR
answers unless this type of synonymy is required. indeed,
the use of phrase looses you several important student
feedback possiblilities (e.g., order markup).

secondly, you should be using:
specs okcap

and not:
specs bumpshift

"okcap" specifically checks for first letter capitalization
while "bumpshift" removes the shift codes from the student
answer even in the middle of words.

finally, I don't think you need the -endarrow- command.
This command is intended to allow the author a place for
processing after the student input to the current arrow gets
an "ok" judgement. It is particularly useful when there
are several correct -answer- commands and when there are
several -arrow- commands in the same unit. Otherwise it
just takes up space and time.

to Chabay...its never right to have something that serves
no purpose. To say "always use an -endarrow-"
is like saying "aways knock on wood before starting
a new venture"" If -endarrow-s seem to help the code but
with no better explanation than knocks helping one's newest
venture. then something is wrong with TUTOR and that needs
to be fixed/improved...not perpetuated!

good point jim--i have ALWAYS wondered what accounted

i never wondered ENOUGH to ask).

personally i prefer to let the students enter as
many things as they want to explore the feedback
to wrong as well as right answers-- but that, of
course can play havoc with data collection--but
then what can't (for example students taking
the lesson more than once, etc).

I really have to hand it to the Big U this time. It has
total control over its authors, not only does it take any
lesson it wants and publishes it, but it also decides what
lessons are worthy of being written to begin with. Back in
the old days when lessons were not a financial investment
for the University but rather they were for academic support
I could understand why there should be tight control over
all space, it was logical that all lessons be of practical
use to the University of Illinois. Today, the Big U makes
money (or will be shortly) off of these lessons, without
"honest" permission of the authors (no release, no sign-on).
Unfortunatly though, authors is a bad term since they
have neither the right nor the ability to write what they
want. We still have to scrounge lesson space from anywhere
we can. put in untold hours developing the lessons, only to

author could always claim that his lessons are unfinished,
but I for one would like my work to be used. Authors who
are fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to be writing FOR
the U. of Ill at least get their lesson space provided.
I have gone so far as to offer to pay for lesson space
since I need sufficient space to at least test the lesson
my only chance was to buy my own terminal and pay the
annual fee. It is sad that this must be so since I am
willing to pay for space so that in the end the Big U will
be able to reap the benefits from my work which they won't
be paying me to do. I suppose all you authors out there
who work for the U or others, will think this whole thing

Maybe I misread the agreement, but I had the impression
that having lessons sold to CDC and having lessons which
are used by UI students are not necessarily the same thing:
if I could use the analogy of authors of books: in many
(most) cases, the writer doesn't know if the book will be
bought till after he has written it. On the other hand,
textbooks are often bought on the strength of a Table of
Contents and a sample chapter or two, and the author gets
a tidy advance....

You only have to convince any one faculty member that the
lessons you propose to write will be of value, and you get
lesson space without cost. Is that a bad policy?

As long as disk-space is in short supply, I oppose selling
it. Too many things go only to the people with money.

Another point: You misquoted the Universities policy. It
will not publish lessons against the author's will. If
you are uncommissioned, you do not have to pretend that
the lesson is unfinished, you merely choose to not publish.
Commissioned lessons are another case, of course.

You say, "As long as disk space is in short supply...",

My own guess is that as long as disk space is allocated
"without cost" to the user, the demand will always
outstrip the supply (brief transition periods excepted).
In that case, your reasoning is totally circular.

If one were to charge accounts for disk space, it would
certainly be possible for account "uiuc" to give out free
space as it saw fit. But the advantages of then letting the
laws of supply and demand determine how much disk a project
is willing to rent are obvious. Then CERL would not be
forced to semi-enforce the guideline that disk should be
allocated by the number of terminals owned -- a rule which
is honored more in the breach than in its observance.

I just don't understand how the supply of money is related
to the legitimate demand for disk-space. Yes you can reduce
it to that. We almost always do in this culture, but I'm
against if for this first PLATO system. I fully expect
CDC and any other commercial vendor to use that method,
since their purpose in life is to exchange service for money

Ours is to develop this medium and explore its uses. I try
to allocate resources accordingly.

"I try to allocate resources accordingly.¬??=====Bill Golden"

This declaration reports accurately that your personal
judgment plays a large role in determining how resources
are allocated on this system. Without necessarily
impugning the quality or degree of impartiality of your
judgment, I point out that it goes largely unaudited.
If prices are rejected as a means for determining who
gets what, then perhaps the principles which _do_ determine
who gets what should be set out for inspection, and
some mechanism provided for recording the ongoing
results of the decisions made according to those principles.
I'm thinking of a lesson which, like 'crash', allows the
user community to participate in a running audit of a
crucial aspect of the system.

---------- response 14
  05/18/76     18.26     michael       english

Point: If users were allowed to rent disk space, then
a higher priority might be given to acquiring more drives
and a new controller/extender when the existing space is
all gone. I would hope that CERL would respond positively
to having money shoved at it; as it is now, the only
recourse the user has is to shout louder that he needs more
space. Additionally, there is little -- if any -- incentive
to turn in lesson space when no longer needed.

Actually, I think the little users might benefit more by
such a scheme, since any U of I student could then come in
and plunk down his $10 for a lesson space.

It is amazing how quickly a controversial subject fills up
note space. Let me restate my point more clearly now that
the initial frustration I felt has been slightly eroded.
     1. I feel that I have a good, solid, marketable
series of lessons to write.
     2. The department that would cover these lessons here
has consistently shown itself to be negatively inclined
toward further expansion and doesn't properly keep up
those lessons it already has.
     3. I am convinced that if done properly this series
could be very effective.
     4.  i am willing to consider paying for the physical
space in which to create such a course because:
        a. I have other's who would author some of the lessons.
        b. I need space to create student records to test
the material I already have, and;

        c. I feel after talking to others in the field
of aviation that PLATO has great potential for training.

     Since Bill has stated that essentially space is
allocated on a somewhat subjective basis, I am only
countering his decision and asking for the right to
purchase space because I feel I have a good idea.
It is in no way similar to the author of a book as was
used as an example. I am willing to invest the time, and
effort, to write the lesson without any type of pay or
advance. I just want the "paper" to write it on, for
which I am willing to pay. For the privilege of access
to a terminal the University of Illinois will get 25: of
any profit that the lesson might make. That is a better
deal for the U of I than they get from most authors, and
if the course should not sell, then it is always available

       Perhaps what is needed here is a thrid avenue to
appeal. If a faculty member rejects the idea, and Mr.
Golden rejects the idea, possibly the person could approach
a "review board". If the review board feels the idea is
worthwhile enough to warrant the space, the person could
re-ask Mr. Golden for the space, with the boards' approval
behind him. By no means would this force Mr. Golden into
giving out the space if he still felt the subject matter
unworthy, but possibly he would have to explain his
"actions against" to the review board.

     The board would have to exclude the already involed
people. The more diverse the constituency, the better,
perhaps, a faculty member, a member of CERL staff, and
an active author on the system. Of course if the board
rejects the idea, that would be it. 3 strikes and you're

Dave Lombardo's point ¬$2 of response 15 is utter nonsense.
I will speak to the people involved. If he has something
creative to do, he will get the space. I have nothing
against intelligent argument, but the kind of
misrepresentation that Lombardo is engaging in here is
of little value. Even though his premises are
incorrect, there is some substance to the discussion.
PLATO should consider setting up organizational structure
less dependent on the good will of Don Bitzer, Propst,
Lyman, Golden et al. Inevitably, these people will
leave and the university will hire a semi-competent
group of administrators. The Student Computer Research
Program, which was established at my suggestion, provides
a model for one such structure.

The standards of intelligent discussion also exclude
sweeping slurs, such as contained in sentences 5 ¬+ 6
of the preceding response. "By their fruits, ye shall
know them...": In 15+ years of continuous development,
PLATO has been brought from the humblest beginnings
to what must, by any standards you choose, be considered
large success. That doesn't happen by luck, but by shrewd
management, whatever creative disregard may be shown for
textbook principles of administration. Bitzer is a superb
administrator, by the most objective measures available.
   The proposals for review machinery are largely beside
the point, partly because avenues of appeal already exist,
but more because (in my view at least) the crucial missing
ingredient is not necessarily good decisions, but continuing
independent audit of whatever decisions are made. What we
need is not more bureaucracy, but more information.

      The problem of who shall decide and by what criteria
they should decide is effectively eliminated by the renting
and/or selling of disk space. The idea of "by their fruits,
ye shall no them..." applies not only to admistrators but
to policies as well. Under the present policy a shortage of
disk space has arisen; let us judge that policy by this
consequence. The supply and demand approach has been shown
to be a workable and fair method of allocation is other
areas; therefore, it is a logical choice to replace the
persent policy. Under such a policy, the intended author of
a lesson (or whoever is paying to have it written) would
have to decide whether the value he/she sees in the lesson
equals or exceeds the cost of the space to write it in.
This process would act as a natural check on the frivilous
and inefficient use of disk space without placing the

I don't wish to digress but I must contest Mr. Carter's
comments. If he were to only take the time to review
some of those lessons he would find they are not well
kept up. There are improper erases causing overwrites,
and several other flaws which have existed for a long
time. I offered to go over the lessons once and was
told that it was needed, but then the issue was avoided
there after. Additionally the department on this campus
that would derive the greatest amount of benefit from
such lessons is not very responsive to their use, I am
sorry Carter, but you really need to check your facts
before you condemn someone else for not checking their
facts!

One problem with rental is that supply and demand works
in a two handed (bladed?) method. Example:

        A price of $10/part is intially set up.
        User demand is high. Disk space becomes "tight".
        Price raised to $15/part. User demand slopes off.
        Later, demand goes up (when the people get "used"
                to paying more)
        Price goes up...

Also, as Mr. Golden says, the people with the money usually
will be the ones to reap the benefit. Your department
(lombardo's) will not find money for you any quicker than
they would find space. Your own investment could become
large. Another problem exists, which will be pointed out
in the following note.

      I don't know whether this has come up before in the
discussion about SD, but I am bringing it up anyway. What
is interfering with the handling of -size- commands?
Several days ago I noticed that, although entering a -size-
command with the S option affected the size of inserted text
_as you wrote it_, removing the -size- command with ERASE did
not allow subsequently entered lines to appear normally. At
the time I didn't pay to much attention to it; I either
backed out of SD and reentered (it would not suffice to go
to the SD index) or inserted and removed a -size 0-.
     Now, however, the size-handling mechanism has been
changed somewhat, but for the worse. Although it does not
mark it as an "unrecognizable line", and it still allows
it to be inserted with the S option, the -size- command is

This problem did not exist, as far as I remember, last week.

Does the lettering have to be white ? Look into the various

jectors: the transparent sheets very considerably in
thickness, durability, etc., but I should think that you
could find one that would suit your purposes: if the
lettering doesn't _have_ to be white, then ordinary inking
on ordinary paper can be Xeroxed and then put through a
device that makes transparencies directly from the Xerox
copy: otherwise, the techniques used to develop colored
transparencies, e.g. in gradeschool classrooms, should
work. Many libraries offer this service.

 Is it planned to make it easier for us to draw
arc's and circles in a lineset (in largegrid mode)?
 I know that a circle could use too many lines,
but it might be possible to let us specify how 'fine'
the circle/arc is to be drawn (i.e. 2 dot minimum length
lines would be a 'fine' circle, while something with
is or more dots as minimum length lines would be 'coarse').

of "fine-ness" should be included in the parameters.

condense lesson -onotes- and got the message "Not enough
ECS" centered in the middle of the screen. However, when I
pressed next and _then_ pressed data from the "Press Data.."

quite puzzling.

Not as strange as it looks... there is a -from- command
in there that detects the fact that the 'Press DATA to
try...' and the author mode page are two different units.
The reason the lesson doesn't work is that it tries to
use system commands that don't condense because the lesson
is not a system lesson (300+ condense errors...).

        If the PLATO network starts acting in a politically
controversial manner, then the normal moratorium on
political discussion in general notes is automatically
suspended.
        And supporting the Shah of Iran is political.
        Maybe most subscribers don't consider admitting
the Shah's CIA-propped autocracy to PLATO to constitute
support for the Shah, nor for fascism generally.
        If this is the overwhelming sentiment, then I'll
drop the issue. (For the reasons stated in my original
note, I consider ANY legitimization of his regime to be a
grave matter.)
        Please, what is the general sentiment? IS
admission of Iran to PLATO a political act? Does it
offend anybody else?

I thought your original note was awfully strong. The matter 
_IS_ important of course and we should not be afraid to
discuss it. I think we should take a great deal of care
about discussing it however. Here is the time to really
take the responsibilities of communication seriously.
It is times like these that I wish public notes was not
so haphazard as they are. With the right kind of
structuring which would encourage direct ideas with
relavent responses (check off on points of main notes
against answering points in responses? who knows?)

I didn't see the original note, and I wasn't aware that Iran
had been admitted to the Plato network (I didn't see any-
thing about it in 'network'); nevertheless, I don't feel
offended by Iranian presence on the system.
It seems to me that if admission were denied on the basis
of disapproval of the Shah's regime then that, in itself,
is a "political act"; presumably, the system simply did not
give consideration (legitimately so, I think) to the "right-
ness" or "wrongness" of the Shah's regime when admission
was granted.
hmmmmm, looks like a political discussion _has_ started in
public notes--unless the sysprogs are willing to delete
this whole thing.

  You seem to be saying that the existence of political
motivation is a sufficient condition for the refusal of
access [to Iran] to be identified as a political act.
However, you overlook two important facts. First of all,
refraining from taking an action is _not_, in itself, an
action. Second, action and motivation are two different
things; therefore, you cannot change a non-action into an
action by referring to motivation.
  In conclusion, allowing Iran access to Plato _is_ a
political act. Whether or not that political act is in
fact morally wrong constitutes a political issue and belongs
in one of the discussion lessons, not in Public Notes. _This_
discussion, however, over whether or not allowing access to
Iran is in fact a political act, is not a political issue
and hence is a proper subject for Public Notes.

Of course, I meant the note could have been transferred

this be totally the author's responsibility? He can't
read other's minds to judge whether or not his note will
be considered 'too political'. If the author is still

I'm sorry, but I fail to see how allowing Iranians to learn
things through PLATO is a political act, unless one takes
the view that _all_ acts are political acts (as some econo-
mists take all acts as economic acts, etc.). If all acts
_are_ political acts, then some political acts are not in
themselves wrong (e.g. would it be wrong to give an Iranian
a drink of water ?) If not all acts are political, then is
CAI political ? I really don't see how. Will PLATO make
the Shah more secure on his throne ? Just how might it
accomplish that ? One might even argue that making the
Iranians more learned could lead to the downfall of the 
Shah, if "the truth shall make you free"....

It appears to me then that none of us should be on the

therefore political. Everyone could be considered
political, are we to sit and judge who should and should
not be allowed access to PLATO on the basis of what
country they are from or what their beliefs are? If so
I think there is a distinct possibility that we are
becoming a bunch of intellectual snobs who are willing

I wonder if there is a mistake somewhere in the "accounts"
switch which allows you to blank either a change code
or an inspect code. I blanked the inspect code on
a particular course (kegedr) but was unable to get into
the course without typing the change code. I rechecked
the accounts record and saw that the inspect code was
blank as I had done before (e.g., "no code--open to
all" under inspect).

If I remember correctly, this is an intentional feature
of the records editor. Because of a problem we were having
with pirated records, it was decided to change the records
editor so that you could only inspect a course if you
knew the inspect code; if the course had no inspect code
yo couldn't inspect it ai all. This was done to protect
course directors who would innocently leave their courses
"open to inspect" from records-pirates, who would look
though courses with no inspect code, trying to find
records without passwords, or even more seriously, records
whose users had not yet chosen a password. In other words,
this is not an "accounts" bug.

If the course records editor has been changed so that
blanking an inspect code in "accounts" does not work, then
this should be noted when an "accounts" director makes
changes there. Perhaps the option should say "sorry,
no blank code allowed here."

        Are allowable dataset record lengths ever
going to be changed? I have had occasion to want
to use a record size of 25 words before, but since
the smallest allowable size is 64 I have to write
a function to section off my own records which is
a hassle. Is there any chance this may change
someday?

---------- response 1
  05/20/76     18.38     blomme       s

  Perhaps from some other type of function. Each
datain/out command is making a disk access, not a
memory reference. Every effort needs to be made to
deal with blocks of data when paying the severe overhead
involved in a disk access. It is conceivable that some
sort of other facility could one day be provided that
would allow small sequential segments to be read from
a buffer area that the system provided, with the system
doing  disk accesses much less frequently to fill/empty
the buffer area. No work in currently planned in this
area that I know of however. In the meantime the limit
imposed "encourages" users to recognize the physical
constraints that the world currently imposes on us.
  One last note: the table required to handle the
reservation of records can become outlandish large as the
record size decreases.
  So no change in the lower limit of 64 words is planned.

---------- note 218 keytype
  05/20/76     12.33     sebby       ve

I think it would be helpful if (someday) the -keytype-
command allowed synonymous groupings somewhat like the
answer command:

keytype akey,¬[next,t(3233;24,2)¬],¬[back,t(3201;24,2)¬]
The ¬[ ¬] would indicate (in this case) that the key and
the touch area should give 'akey' the same value, This
would be helpful when writing lessons that can be used
with or without the touch panel, and where the touch areas
often change making it inconvenient to use -group- commands
for each synonymous group.
Just a thought. Paul Sebby

Could accounts allow at least lengthening of datasets.

I understand (more or less) the argument that shortening a
dataset is not done because it is not readily apparent from
the block directory that data will not be lost (although I
believe we should have the right to lose data just like the
system does, *snicker*). However, this argument does not
hold for increasing the size of a dataset since no data will
be lost (barring read/write errors). Is there some other
reason?

no need to look for this one, the system is working the
way intended for this case...when you take up more than
your share of processing time (and using the editor with
L=30 and rapidly advancing pages...puts a tremendous load
on the computer), the system "slows you down" by pausing
you an amount of time to bring your average TIPS to a
reasonable level. Otherwise, you would essentially be
stealing the computer for your singular use.

the 070 and the 075 and 076 into anything you like---
I chose letters as far from the ones in question as

---------- response 3

Variable length charset means that if there is less that
one block of chars in the charset, it will only take
up one block of space. If there is more than one block,
it will take up two blocks of space. The normal
size of charsets before var len came in was two blocks.
Therefore, Even if you had one char in the set, it look
up two blocks of space...

        As for the 'dmpx' and the 'Error mode = 1'...
your charset was so badly screwed up that it caused
the print formatter to bomb completely. The error
means 'address out of range'. Usually in FORTRAN
or COMPASS (I assume the printer runs on one of those)
it means trying to reference an array out of bounds.

attend law school. We would greatly appreciate it if
authors would take the lesson and let us
know if the format seems workable. Comments are very
welcome (also note any errors!). Send comments
to clark/lawyer.

Lesson name is : lsacindex

It is designed for touch panel but may be used without
a touch panel very easily.

Thanks Greatly, J. Clark Kelso

size of datasets to be changed from the directory page
in a similar way that one is able to change the use flag.

   Could I perhaps have a reply from a responsible

Some time ago, it was mentioned that a -restore- command,
analogous to -remove-, allowing reinstatement of items
into the "modperm" list, would be a valuable addition
to the permutation machinery. It shouldn't be too
hard to do this, and it would come in very handy in
some cases.

Noticed a problem this evening.

1) had source block with some code in it...did D-322...block
        empty 
2) convert to common...common empty
3) condense lesson (via stop1) - common not empty
4) go back into lesson convert common to source - original
        code back in block

Yes I'm sure i used -help1- the block WAS empty.
very repeatable...4 times in a row.

---------- response 1

Well, I just checked the common in edit mode, before i just
did it in inspect mode...
It seems that although the source block appears empty, when
it is a common block everything is still there.

        If I'm not mistaken, the delete from inside or
outside a block doesnt actually destroy anything. It
simply resets the pointers, so that you may recover after
you discover a drastic error. Now if you CREATE a common
after doing a global delete (HELP1 from the block directory)
then you physically wipe out the contents of a file, and
reset the pointers.

Luke is correct--the block is deleted logically, not
overwritten. That is why it is possible to "recover" a
block.

I have been following Public Notes fairly closely and have
not seen the following suggestion and felt it would be
worthy of consideration:

Would it be possible to flag one (or all) lesson(s) upon
requesting a print of them (via P option) so that if their
requestOr is still on the system, the requestOr would be
notified as is presently being done in -alarm-?

This would certainly prove useful as many people have
files that need to be mailed to various addresses. At
present, they have to constantly check P(rint) to see
that the files indeed were printed at which point they
change the address and request again. With the above
suggestion's implementation, a person would be able to
work at leisure, not having to worry about the print
time-table.

  This idea has been suggested before. It is kind of a

airconditioning on a VW Bettle. It is not completely
trivial, and would it really be used much?

  For your particular problem, why don't you just write
the two addresses in block "a", along with an explanation.
If you request two printouts at the same time, the operator
on duty should have no problem figuring out what to do.

Would it be possible to add to the -term- calc a definition
for converting coarse to fine and fine to coarse? They
could be of the form

finex(coarse)
finey(coarse)
coarse(finex,finey)

Would this help anyone else? I know it would save me
many trips to aids and then -term- calc since I don't keep
the formulae in my head.

Of course, appropriate use of -term- cursor could save you 
from those trips into Aids, but I can see that if you were
in -term- calc already or needed to do calc's on the basis
of coordinate values that such functions would be nice.

Since this feature has been requested from time to time I
would assume that it has either been pushed down (off) on
someones job board or scrapped for one reason or another.

Just a thought, how does this strike you?

instead of having one set of unconditional commands (write,
answer, calc, etc.) and another set of conditional commands
(writec, answerc, etc.)...how about combining them, and
making the "¬." an expression separator.
If the form is

write abcdefg $$then it is a regular -write-

if it is

write exp¬,abc¬,def $$then it is a conditional -write-

well, a ¬, is a
micro ¬Ww ¬A micro ¬Wx
it's not the extra letter, it just seems more consistant
with -branch-, -jump-, -do-, etc.

there are already a whole set of commands which are like
this, and "it would be consistant"

also I thought that the form
command exp,a,b,c,d,e,f

would be a little easier for a novice to distinguish than

I think this attacks a more basic problem: consistency
in conditional commands. Some use semis as the delimiter
and some use commas. Others (like writec) use both
commas and ¬,'s. This comes from the bit-by-bit development
of the system. Some time in the future (a rainy month??),
someone might consider trying to make the delimiters
uniform.

---------- response 10

I would like to see the exp set off by ¬, in all conditionals
and the ; as the case separator - except in writec where you
need the ¬,.

But I still think it would look better if all commands were
consistant in form...either take out all the writec's,
answerc's and replace them with write exp¬, etc., or make
all the others jump/jumpc branch/branchc...

Until such time when the systems folk change over you can
easily separate your expression from the cases by:

---------- response 13

But of course one of them could be made the conditional form
and the other a special command. Probably 

       calcc ¬D calc exp¬,,,,,

       and 

       calcs remaining the same.

However, language structure for structures sake is not
everything. And considering the massive changes involved
it may either be too late to do, or it should be done

should it be easier for novices to learn, but I would think
it would be easier for occasional authors to remember.

I don't know when the overwrite occured, nor do I know
when I put those two blocks in (they are charset blocks,
and date is 'unknown').

  Foiling my attempts to get a decent backup, is the 
fact that I have not the slightest idea of which dates
backups for that lesson are available.

   Is there any chance at all that 'backups' could
give us a listing of what dates backups are around for

A quick review of the backup system (a quiz later):

   Every morning, except Saturday, a program is run to
copy all the files that have been changed in any way to a
backup disk pack. This is a 'daily' backup, and is stored
for two weeks. On Saturdays, the program copys all the
files on a pack to a corresponding 'exact' backup pack.
These are re-used every week.

   Every other week, a program merges the names of all
the files on the previous two weeks daily backups, then
copies those files from active packs to 'biweekly' packs.
These last several months, at which time all these packs
are merged similarly to form 'bimonthly' packs. These are
kept for at least 6 months, at which time they are merged
to form 'archival' packs which will be stored for years.

More detailed information is available from the ops or in
the help units of lesson 'backups'.

   Could some thought be placed into enabling some
sort of one-time EXECUTABLE -storage- command? As we
stand now, the maximum amount of storage that can be taken 
by various tables and lists must be allocated to each stu-
dent, so as to service all possible situations that might
come up. In some cases, all storage may be utilized, and
in others, (which are the majority of the cases) most all
is left unused, but is still drug along. This is grossly
wasteful, but necessary...
   It is presently possible to do limited manipulations
to the storage size, but only at great cost insofar as
computer/condense time.
   The limitations on the command would be that of
-leslist-, such that only one per lesson entry per student
is allowable.

 Don't look for it too soon.
 Executable storage does exist, but it happens
to be a system command valid only for system lessons.
And I have never seen a case on this system yet that
a 'new feature' has been announced that duplicates a

Thats circular reasoning. It doesn't make sense
to argue that it won't happen because it never
happened before.

I would love to see something like this. I won't
say anything about the features of this since Dave
has summed it up quite well. But, I wouldn't 
doubt that we could see a definite reduction in
ECS use by several systems if they could use such
a command. Many programs have several routines
that use varying amounts of storage depending
on who the user is.

  I like the idea but...

  What about the student who signs into a lesson and
does 1/2 hours or so work. And at that point in the lesson,
he runs across the need for more storage ( for however
short a time). And while he has been signed on, ECS has
gone to pot. It's not unusal (at least to those of us who
use 165) to have mallot>muse for up to 10-15 min. during
the day. So what about the poor student? He sits and
stares at the panel, waiting. Or he gives up and leaves,
possibly having to redo the work he's just done at a later
date, or even it not, rather disappointed in the system.
As it stands now, if a student starts a lesson now, he
is assured (crashes excepted) of completeing it.

Or is there an easy way around this I've missed?

anderer:

Dave is not requesting that you be able to change the
storage allotment once it has been assigned. Rather,he
is asking for a variable amount of storage assigned when
the student first encounters the storage command.

You are right that if there were not enough ECS when
the storage command was executed, the student would not
get his/her storage. That's probably why the system
has never given us an executable storage command.

Could it be that the use would not be directly but indir-

flexible construction of lessons that can aid authors in
developing course material rather than a command that is

for student use?

It is not a matter of whether enough storage will exist
when the student enters the lesson. That may be the
case already, without an executable storage command.

Fuller's suggestion may serve to allieviate the ECS
problem. Not all users will require maximum storage in
one of my lessons, for example, and that amount may be
determinable on entry to the lesson, but each user must
currently be given the same amount of storage.

attached to a particular site and station which is
broken....for instance, a terminal with a broken
touch panel or slide selector. When someone signs into
that terminal, a message appears, giving the person
a list of the broken parts which are written up in
lesson rapair...to avoid double writeups, and to avoid
not learning till to late that the terminal is broke
instead of the program or the lesson.

This is our ideal but won't be feasible until there is
a method of identifying terminals remotely (a possibility
with the next generation of terminals). Currently, people
often shift lines to a given terminal in an attempt to
isolate problems. As a result, we can never be sure that
a down terminal is still at the site-station it was on when
reported (to say nothing of the hassle when, because of a
phone line problem or dead terminal, there is no way to
find out the site and station number at the time of report).
The method now used is to let a person making a report know
if that same terminal is already on report -- that is about
the best that can done . Thanks for the suggestion
though.     Al Avner

There are problems with both of those:

1. If you auto checkpoint your common, you lose
the ability to abort common if you mess something up.

2. Only authors can manually return common, and have
to leave the lesson to do so.

we would not be able to write to datasets under program

I assure you that as far as I'm concerned the system is
saving NO disk accesses by not having the feature we are
requesting, since alot of my programs -dataout- their common
to a dataset whenever a crucial change has been made.
I will continue to do this until there is a better way
to accomplish the same thing. So, if this feature gets
implemented, at least in my case, it could actually result
in a decrease of disk access on my part, rather than an
increase, because I could eliminate the -datain- that must
be done to initialize the common and the -dataout- that must
be done when the last student leaves, not to mention the
dataset attaches that must be done in the course of all
this. I think this is typical of the kinds of stunts people
have to resort to when they are working with highly
sensitive databases, so it may well be that the system as
a whole will save on disk access by implementing this.

---------- response 10
  05/24/76     19.48     blomme       s

  The statement that disk accesses to a dataset are
not restricted is very definitely in error. The
frequency of such accesses IS restricted, and if
we start using more of the disk transfer capacity then
the penalty for frequent accesses will obviously grow
in order to allocate the system's resources equitably.
You can view each disk access as having an "autobreak"
of duration appropriate to your priority and your usage
of that system resource (by priority, I mean to indicate
that system-type requests generated by signing on, etc.
would be given greater priority). Currently there is
enough spare capacity that rapid accesses are possible
for essentially everyone.

---------- response 11
  05/24/76     20.24     j wilson       unidel

re. the current tangent:

        How can we evaluate programming schemes when
the system allows us to use "spare" capacity without
feedback (other than what could be kept with some
difficulty "manually")? Will PLATO IV and PLATO V
systems be designed to accommodate these or greater
access rates?

        For now, it would be very desirable to
have access to statistics regarding disk accesses
by signon or by lesson, or, at minimum, an option
analogous to the CPU-limiting author option.
---------- response 12
  05/24/76     22.58     blomme       s

  For some indication how far ahead the system staff
has been able to foresee and anticipate system behavior,
please see the notes on system limits in the system
announcements, dated 9/24/74. The total disk access
rate we can support was indicated then to be about
1 access per minute for each of 1,000 active terminals.
If we were to set the figure so that 500 active terminals
could function properly, then the access rate imposed
would be 1 per 30 seconds.
  Indeed, as this becomes a problem we will presumably
provide the equivalent of a disk "background" to permit
users at slack periods to use the spare capacity available
at such times and some such limit will be imposed otherwise.
While we may be able to set such a limit as low as 1 disk
access every 15 seconds (were we to be extremely liberal),
we clearly could never permit 1 a second or faster as is
typically the case now.

---------- response 13
  05/25/76     08.30     j wilson       unidel

I was aware of the "limits" note. The statistics I want
are those that would allow users to determine easily
whether a given application falls within those limits.
Such feedback seems essential when we know that the
"if it works now, it will continue to" rule won't work.
A system-kept statistic in course records (as CPU-use
is now kept) would be much easier than to try to have
counters placed in any sequence of lessons that may
be of interest.

Secondly, if users have good uses for greater access
rates (authors must exceed 1/15 now, right?), is it
planned to design systems within which these limits
would be different (as has been the case with CPU and
short-term memory)?

I hate to be a wet blanket, but seeing how humid it is
in here...
Could we please stay on the subject of the note: the
ability to "checkpoint" common under program control?
I'm fully aware that such a "checkpoint" would have to
be included in the disk accesses/minute calculation. I
think everyone requesting this feature understands that
it would be counted against our disk-access priority just
like a datain or dataout command, so I think Rick Blomme
is fighting a straw man by trotting out the figures about
the anticipated use of the disk hardware. I would simply
like to know what the obstacle is to having the feature
we are requesting. Does the system staff think it would
result in a greatly increased burden on the disk hardware?
Do they think it's not of general enough use to justify
its implementation? Or is there some other reason? I would
really appreciate an explanation.

When you are in a helpop-type unit, BACK and BACK1 take
you out of the unit and back to your point of origin.
No amount of -back-, -backop-, -base-, or any other sort
of command can prevent this. The only way to keep the
BACK and BACK1 keys from doing their default thing is to
make them -jkey-s at all -arrow-s and to disable the BACK
and BACK1 keys at all keys= -pause- commands. Yes, this
is a pain, but the last time I screamed for some way to
change the operation of BACK and BACK1 in helpop-type

It is not a question of the extra read operation. (Yes

point is that those variables are reserved to the router.
Routers can be written without elaborate consistency checks

I had thought that the present means of protection was
quite simple; a -transfr routvars- first checks the value
of rvallow and produces an execution error if rvallow=0.

By allowing nr variables to appear on the right hand side
of calc statements (show commands too??) it seemed the
protection mechanism would become too tricky.

My note implied impossibility for this protection which is

after the freeze.

unit: statload, last command: stoload, ist command;

I think I was on the index page when the error occurred.

Your dataset can be cleared by:

            knowing the change codeword.
        2)  Another lesson using the correct common code-

Yes, I thought about the same thing, and have

1) lesson error
2) system error

and, I seriously doubt it is a lesson error..
I have checked and checked and checked,
and it seems that most of the time it works,
and my dataset stays intact, but every four
or five days, somehow a record, (and only one record)
gets zeroed, therbye strenghtening the facts behind
it being a lesson error since only portions are zeroed..
and, because it seems to only be one record that gets zeroed
and no other record is ever zeroed, but, I have checked
and, find no place that a dataout could read out
empty storage..so..I was hoping there might be something
I was missing..

         System errors are unlikely, and should not even
be considered until every other possibility has been
truly exhaausted. Are you sure there is data in your
buffer when you use -dataout-? Have you carefully checked
the values of pointers and length variables? Are you
sure your -finish- unit acts properly (this one can be
very hard to track down)?

        Having said all of that, a few weeks ago, during
system test time, when a very flakey version was running,
the last thirds of many of the records of my dataset were
zeroed. I could not find any lesson error which could
have caused this, and it seemed especially unlikely, since
I never read or wrote more than one record at a time.
Still, I would rather believe it was my error, and will
continue looking for it. But what if...

This is one of the problems of using datasets...it gives
you not only the welcome ability to permanently store your
data, but also the unwelcome ability to permanently store
your errors. If a mistake is being made somewhere along
the line in the preparation of your database, it might
not show up right away...if it's a sufficiently subtle
error, it might not show up for many sessions, maybe
not even for months. Then one day, someone embarks upon 
an improperly barricaded pathway through your program
and ***phoomp***: instant chaos. Take it from one who has
spent many a long evening banging his head against the
floor muttering "it can't happen here". Look at it this
way: if your problem was due to a freak system error,
it would be very unlikely to occur more than once...
Especially to the same block of the same dataset.

I was calmly editing my lesson when I decided (for reasons
unknown even to me) that I wanted to change terminals.
I didnt bother getting out of 'edit' because I figured
that when I signed-onto the other terminal, it would have
no trouble kicking me off the old terminal.
   When I tried to get into my lesson again on the new
terminal, all I got was a message saying something to the
effect of "Call an op, your lesson is tied to site 25-29".
   I had to go back to the other terminal and go into my
lesson again before I could edit my lesson on the new
terminal.

A minor problem with inspecting datasets in the editor:

can eventually inspect these variables, however.)

The number of "continued blocks" for some (or all)

     A thought:
Could there please be a way in the course roster,
perhaps involving an extra keypress, to see if there
are course-director messages for the users in the roster?
     This would be very handy frequently, as many
users fail to get very old messages. It would also
be helpful when authors are being moved to different
courses...the standard procedure is to leave a message
and then, after 'enough time' has passed, to delete
the old record. An indication on the course roster
as to whether an author has recieved (and, of course,
blanked) a message would be helpful.

        The branch structure, is, at present, faster,
because of the less redundant, and cleaner method of
execution enabled (or at least it was faster last time
I checked).
       Note that use of logical operators slows execution
of TUTOR down because of floating point checking that must
be done, versus the integer checking (and rounding) done
in cases such as:

branch  (n1-1),x,10

        Not as readable, but faster...

        In point of fact, I would think the -calcs-
would generate more condensed code, but is, as you state,
smaller on disk.

I would guess that is because the branch structure is
compiled into machine code, while the -calcs- is done
interpretivly (forgive my sp.). This would also probably
mean that the branch is faster, but I'm too lazy to check.

---------- response 5

I think you'll find it takes a certain amount of time
to do a call for non-calc commands (calcs, do, etc.)
Once the subroutine is called up, calcs is very fast, so
the main time required is in doing the call (might be just
the reverse for something like a -do-). I don't think
the branch (=calc) requires a similar call, so it is a
much faster command. I think you are talking in terms
of merely fast vs super fast, tho, so the clarity of the
calcs is likely worth the extra time.

"tightening it up" if it is part of a loop that is done

Yes, that last is about as "clear-as-mud" and takes quite
some time to interpret the exact meaning of the code. The

unless working with sections that have high iteration

Strange as it may seem I too believe in readability of code.

I also use -branch-s and -calcs-s. However, there are other
features in the TUTOR language, i.e., embedded conditional
expressions, which can be used to do nice things when they
are needed. In the case where a millisecond here and a
millisecond there add up to minutes I prefer to try and save
as many of those milliseconds as possible.

If you have once figured out the form

        variable ? value + (value-newvalue) ? (condition)

remembering that True = -1 and False = 0, then it is not
difficult to recognize that form again as well as several of
its variations.

There are indeed some languages which let you do

It's easy to read, not dependent upon the machine
representation of TRUE ¬+ FALSE, and works on top of
it all. That define is the same sort of thing, and
a step in a very right direction.

Well, one cause of that would be if you were making the
first response to a note, and while in the process of
responding the original author were to edit the note
and, then you try and store response while he is editing.
 This would cause the following:

1) you would be dumped to index page when you were done.
2) your response would not exist.
3) after original note was through being edited, it
   would exist; without your response.

With all the discussion about disk accesses, can
someone offer a reasonably detailed explanation
for the choice of an all ECS-swapping system

     Speed was the reason for using ECS for storing
lesson binaries and student bank information.

As an interesting exercise, multiply 30 ms average
disk access time ? any number of terminals you wish
between 300-1000 ? 4 accesses per user for lesson
and student bank in/out etc , then add 2 ms processing
per user to find out how long it would take to service
the queue if each user pressed a key simultaneously and
compare this with the average of .5 to 2 keys per second
for average users, and you will see why Plato is not
using a 360 . Current technology has not yet
driven the cost of MOS memory down to ECS levels, but
just wait until those reputed 100K chips come out!!

        A low priority thought for the systems people.

        When one signs on the system, one receives the
message informing him/her of their signon's next previous
whereabouts. Unfortunately, as soon as the user goes to
another page (NOTES,user,etc), this information is gone
and cannot be accessed again unless one has access to
their course records. Would it be possible to store this
"last station on" information so that it would be able
to be viewed from the I option (LAB from -user-)?

The only trouble with 'I' is that it will not show you

I last used the signon, I usually want to see where I last
used it because I always know what site and station I last
used the records at. 'I' does not show you anymore

I think in line with that it would be _nice_ if when viewing
notes the date of last reading was listed. The problem
with "I" is that if the system crashes you sometimes get
an update which is no longer functional in determining
when you last read through notes. Believe me though, I
just think it would be nice - about 3 on a 1 - 25 scale of

Yes, the term is valid in a -press- command, but
it seems that the term interrupts all processing
(including the next keypresses you have programmed) while
waiting for some key input from the terminal. I found this
out by trying the same sort of code before. I do not
believe there is a way around it.

that won't work for the simple reason that once the

'program' control. but under 'system' control......
this is true for 'system type' terms such as 'talk'
'consult', and 'operator'. However, if youre -term- 'time'
appears within the structure of yor program then control
will be switched to the -unit- in which the -term time-
command resides...

that at home on paper first, then just copy in into the

There is an alternative available to any project director
who has control of a course--assign a record to each
lesson and provide traps and codeword protection so it
is the only non-student record that can access the lesson
in author or student mode. If this record is the only
one used for inputing code, author reviews, and revisions,
its total time gives an ESTIMATE of the ON-LINE effort
required in production. It still has the drawback of
not saying anything about time spent observing students,
interpreting student data, gathering subject-matter
background materials, etc., etc.

        We at the photography department would like
to put together a comprehensive dictionary/glossary
that could be accessed from all of our lessons-to-be.
The number of definitions will eventually be large
(perhaps up to 1000), but accesses will usually be
short. There will also sometimes be multiple users.
The main problem, of course, is that the amount of
data to be accessed is large. I would also like to
have the ability to branch the student to one of our
lessons for more extensive info, if the definition
is not satisfying. The present plan in to use a
dataset for definiton and info storage, but we are
hesitant to begin a from-scratch system before
exploring possibilities.
        If anyone has any ideas, or knows of any
existing info-retrieval system that we could borrow
either whole or in part, please leave a pnote
for fiddler/cerl.

some unaddressed problems with such lists include:

a) what you do when there is insufficient ecs to go
to the glossary lesson, or once there, to get the
student back to where (s)he was studying
*
b) the tremendous number of disc accesses which will
be required if these systems are widely used

*----------
aren't these serious enough problems, at least during
peak use periods that the use of a hardcopy dictionary
might be better--especially for as few as 1000 words.

        As I said in note ¬$550, I do not intend that
"dipcie" be used widely, simply that it be used in those
cases where large reference lessons become ECS-bound. Such
applications exist on PLATO, and will no doubt continue to,
although they will hopefully always remain a small (very
small) subset of all PLATO lessons.

        I have already implemented a large, AIDS-type
lesson for the Office of Computer Services here at Cornell
using the DIPCIE system. In our case, since the user is
looking for a particular piece of information, disk acceses
are well-spaced, as it takes the user at least a minute
to absorb a page of text in the average case.

        When I wrote DIPCIE, I considered the disk access
problem; based on what the systems staff has told us, I
do not think this sort of approach will cause problems.

It has come to mind that a very worthwhile addition to the
much improved SD editor, would be to include an indicator
of remaining block space. This, I feel, would save
many a pain from the SORRY BLOCK FULL message appearing
just a little to late. Maybe this could be implemented
on one of the versions in the near future. I feel that
this addition would greatly reduce the author suicide
rate, and I feel that its implementation would
be appreciated by anyone who uses SD.

Along the same lines: When you get that message, could
you have the option to drop off material at either the
begining or the end of either the block or the stuff you
took to SD/SS? To add to a display, I oftentimes have to
move the original display to a new block and then SD. When
I come back, I would rather keep the new stuff and don't
care about the old. Anyone else agree? (perhaps SHIFT-HELP
could do that)

---------- response 2
  05/28/76     08.08     barr       econp

         I think the option clark suggested: deleting
the code taken to SD would often be a big help. When
I am justifing text already on Plato or editing justified
text, all I want to do is replace the old with the new
version. I do an SD, type the new version in, return
to the block, delete the old, fix the at's.

         When the SD does not have any more room. I
should be given the option to drop 1 through x number
of lines taken to SD. (I should be able to delete the
lines without removing them from the current screen
display)

         If I could delete the old version in SD.
1) I would not have the problem of running out of space
half way through. 2) I could reposition the display before
returning to the block.

---------- note 550 "dipcie"
  05/27/76     17.46     mike b       cornell

         I have written an editing utility which may be of
some use to some authors. It attacks the problem of main-
taining large numbers of textual displays with a minimal
ECS charge.

         This is done by generating a compact code in
a dataset and then interpretively executing the displays
generated in the lesson which requires them. Unlike pre-
viously released utilities of this nature, my lesson
indexes the created displays and provides ways of inter-
linking displays for student-initiated branching, as well
as the capability of doing the very simple judging required
for indices.

         The lesson is "dipcie". I would hope that most
authors would have no use for it, since PLATO should be
more than a page-turner. But for those unavoidable refer-
ence lessons, DIPCIE may be what you need.

decides to press -HELP1- to boot me off, while, unknown
to him, I'm editing.

Now, the question is....will the changes I've made in my

Many people in CS related fields will have to work

an IBM or IBM-compatable computer. This is a fact
of the current computer market and no matter how much

Well, for one thing, neither IBM nor Amdahl (who makes IBM

to matching the capacity of the 175. I believe, that with

So what? I didn't say anything in my response about

than anything IBM makes. But I had other things in
mind like education and experience. It may be that
students on this campus deserve experience on another
computer, but I would also like to see some way for
students to get access to many different types of

because the University decided to choose CDC.

Students (at least for now) have access to two IBM
machines via CSO, the 360 here in C-U and the 370
at the med center in Chicago. If the Cyber 175 is
indeed purchased by the U of I, I still don't see
any problem in accessing the Chicago 370.

As for relative processing power, in benchmark tests
between the Amdahl machine and the Cyber 175, both
were given three hours to process assorted jobs.
The Cyber finished all the jobs given it in 1.5 hours
whereas the Amdahl machine was still chugging away
at the three hour mark (don't remember when it
finally did finish; somewhere in the neighborhood
of 3.7 hours, I think).

Since CSO (computing services office for you non-UI

facility, I see the purchase of the Cyber as a
definite improvement. Maybe we'll even have decent
turnaround for once...

No personal offense meant, Tim. I just found the unadorned
preference expressed in response 3 to be, well, disgusting.

In discussing the relative merits of computers, I am
outside my field of expertise. But the impression I have
gained over 15 years is that IBM is where it is NOT because
of superior hardware or software, but because of good
salesmen, pr, a big service organization, clever business
ploys, and a rather unscrupulous exploitation of their
early dominance in the field. To the extent that this
impression is accurate, it is disheartening to hear people
talk as if IBM's dominance must be regarded as eternal, and
as if choices must always be made so as to enhance it (like
have CS students surrounded with IBM stuff just because that
is what there is the most of already).

I have had considerable experience with IBM computers

of both, I am of the opinion that IBM has far superior
periperals (not mainframes) and their service organization
is far better than anything else I've ever seen. I also
have a personal preference for their software as opposed
to CDC's. From the experiences that I've had, I don't
think that my opinion was "unadorned".

In response to the note about linking the IBM and CDC

   Decisions on such major purchases clearly have many
considerations. Hopefully one of the prime ones is
the amount of computing capacity provided for the
money available. It is totally absurd to talk about
average users needing to have IBM equipment. The basic
computer courses teach beginners how to program using
one (or more) of the basic computer languages supported
by nearly every computer in existence. Details in
running jobs vary almost everywhere, not just from
machine to machine. As far as advanced students are
concerned, learning in detail how to program in assembly
language on ANY machine provides the basic "feel" needed
for such programming regardless of machine. In fact, such 
courses have frequently used PDP11's in the recent past.
   Even the hinted implication that IBM's JCL is something
good is a new outlook to me.

Will there ever be a tag for the cstop and cstart commands?
Existing commands would not even need to be changed. The 
tag could be -1 or 0 to "execute" or ignore the command 
at condense time. A good use of this would be for "used"
lessons which are "modularized". A "user" could specify
which sections of the used lesson he wanted through
the use of defining constants. It would also make debugging
within a lesson easier as you could put cstops and cstarts
around in different places and then merely change the
value of constants to condense or not condense certain
code. Thanks for thinking about it, J. Clark Kelso

Whatever type of computer is chosen for CSO (see previous
note on this subject), it would be of great help to many
of us if the following two services could be implemented.

1. A version of the PLATO text editor for use on the
   new system's timesharing terminals -- to save me
   and others the trouble of learning how do use still
   another text editor.

2. A facility for sending programs requiring the special
   capabilities of the new system from PLATO to the new
   computer and for sending results back to PLATO. A nice
   extra would be an adaptation of some of the cs lessons
   so that syntax errors in FORTRAN, COBOL, etc. programs
   could be detected before they were sent over.
   It might be appropriate to credit CERL with an
   appropriate amount from the research account whose
   programs were being run or checked.

We have had a serious problem with our disk controller
since Sunday night; this resulted in files that were
changed Sunday and Sunday night being written back to disk
incorrectly. The affected part of the file could then not
be read back from the disk.

Because the errors are scattered, we decided to back up
the disk system to Saturday morning (from 1 am to 3 am,
depending on the file). Thus, files that were not touched
over the weekend are the same; files that were changed
since Saturday morning are back to the way they were.

If you have changes in a file that you want to keep, please
request a backup in lesson "backups". There are backups
of all files (some with disk errors...) up to Sunday night.

Yes, it is now possible to have a charset loaded auto-

from the Block Directory page to enable/disable this
feature. The setting of the security code from inspect
mode that used to be on shift-DATA is now on shift-BACK.
Needless to say, you probably hit NEXT instead of DATA

More on the UIUC CSO computer:?
I understand from Associate Director George Badger that
the IBM 360/75 will continue in operation at least for the
1976-77 academic year, to allow for a gradual changeover
rather than a panicky, precipitous one; and that at least
a small amount of 360 or 370 service will continue to be
made available indefinitely, for those running programs
which cannot be converted (e.g., canned programs).? 
The new CDC machine (which I assume will in fact be
acquired) is to be set up in room 94 DCL, in the basement
underneath the 360/75-DEC10 computer room (room 194).
Room 94 was originally designed as a computer room, but
has so far never had any large computer installed in it.?
For the 1976-77 academic year, the 100-level CS courses,

This comment is a repeat of one lost in the crash.
Whatever new computer is bought, I hope that the powers
that be will consider implementing three features:

1. An editor very similar to the PLATO text editor for
use on the new computer's CRT terminals -- to save me and
others the trouble of learning the coventions of still
another text editor.
2. Software/hardware to allow the running of PLATO
terminals as terminals on the machine (something like
what they have on the CSL DEC-10).
3. Software/hardware to allow entry of jobs stored in
PLATO files to the new computer and storing of results
back in PLATO files. A nice extra would be syntax checking
of FORTRAN, etc. programs on PLATO before they were sent
over.

I realize that some of these services might properly involve

There's nothing wrong with the directory, it's just
that your archive file doesn't exist. If you make an
archive and then destroy it, this is what will happen.
The main notes file has no way of knowing that the archive
no longer exists.

To fix it, just delete the file name from the archive
table.

This happened to me also. I tried the LAB option to select
the oldest archive file, then I tried entering the oldest
archive file's name. Neither worked, so I looked at the
archive file list. It was listed there. I BACKed out to
the note selection arrow and typed "oldest". The file was
there with all of its notes. I went into the gnote file
editor from that oldest archive file, pressed LAB, at which
point it was accepted, with the oldest file getting the
archived notes. This does seem screwed up.

Names of files by request. There was only one archive file.

Havent I seen this somewhere before? I suppose it has
returned because an unsatisfactory answer was recieved
(or none at all).

The record size change could either be done from the
block directory page or it could be implemented on the
DATA1 page.

Another place could be on the already-very-full-DATA-page
and could be included as part of the *list info output.

Well, we might respond, if we get a chance....

I have one concern about this proposal: a dataset record
is a "record", and has thereby a certain logical existence
in its own right. So are you talking about having us zero
and re-initialize the dataset for your convenience, changing
the record size at that time? Or do you want a feature that
does not zero your dataset, but re-blocks in into a
different record size?...

I have put the matter this way to emphasize that the ease
of implementation of your request depends on dataset
"record" always being implemented as they are now--as
consecutive and contiguous fields in a long vector. Once
we implement the feature you ask for, we are committed to
the current scheme.

Do you want to go ahead and give us your list of beautiful
uses?

Would there be any chance of adding an optional third tag to
the -showa- command that would allow one to indicate which
character position of a word the -showa- was to start with.
This is similar to the character position selection in the
-move- and -search- commands. It would remove the necessity
of doing large numbers of -move-s to -showa- text which is
non-word boundary oriented.

A limit to values 1 to 10 could be imposed if necessary
rather than allowing the great latitude of the -move- and
-search- commands.

At 9:27 this morning I examined the ecs in use by PLATO
classroom site 1, plato. The ecs in use was listed as
20293 words. Nine authors were listed on the site page.
Each author was using 1500 words. (9?1500=13500)

Are there "hidden" ecs charges? Can someone explain
why the sum of words for the listed users does not
equal the total ecs word charge?

---------- response 1
  06/03/76     09.42     resch       nursing

Total ecs charged to a site is not always the total of
the ecs charged to individuals. This allows for the
use of lessons like aids and 'SS', which are >1500 words
to be used by authors, no matter what the ecs situation,
charging them only 1500 words.

Perhaps the total site ecs usage should reflect this, but
I am not sure that this is a trivial matter.

One further though: the "move" feature is hardwired,
at least on the old CPU. Thus, it is very fast. Such
a feature that would work on segment sizes that don't
fall on character boundaries is likely to be slow.

---------- response 3
  06/03/76     19.09     michael       cornell

Since the new CPU doesn't have it anyhow, the difference
in speed between -move- and -moveseg- wouldn't be that
great; they'd both have to be software simulated. However,
you'd get a pretty big increase in speed on the segment
type (as opposed to doing it with a -calc- loop) because
PLATO would know exactly where the next segment to be
moved was, without having to figure it out each time.

There are some pretty strange things going on, and I have
reason to suspect that a pointer or something is messed
up somewhere... When you access the name 'alex', you
get the name 'simonian'. However, accessing the name
'simonian' also accesses 'simonian'. When you check
the statistice, both names are shown, and then have the
same number of hours,days, etc. even though alex has
never been on before.

You are correct, a pointer in the directory was wrong.

I modified the directory information so it is again
intact, but you will have to delete the "alex" signon,
and re-create it, as it points to an uninitialized
block in the course.

If you, or anyone, can repeatedly duplicate this
error, we would appreciate knowing about it.

Some lesson do jumpouts to other lessons, and it is rather

The student was not doing a jumpout, I know this for a
fact. The unit he came from and should have ended up in
are all in the same lesson. The student was bumped
because of insufficient ECS, and was given the message
about call you instructor. I realize there was
trouble with ECS but I had thought it was impossible for
a student to get bumped from his lesson as long as he was
not doing a jumpout to another lesson.

The small character designer of the lineset editor is
based on 8?6 matrix. The large character design is
based on ?x=7 and ?y=15 in order to allow characters
designed in the small character editor to be connected.

A better way would be to allow the cursor in the small
editor to range on a 9?17 dot matrix. With this solution
the connecting problems go away. There is no need to depart
from ?x=8 and ?y=16 in order to connect characters designed
in the small character designer.

   The problem will NOT "go away"! And it is not really
solved by spacing over 7?15; a number of people examined
the problems in detail many months ago when linesets
were first considered and no general solution was ever
found. If a series of lineset chars are required to
make up one "picture" they simply will not coincide
exactly in size 1 with the corresponding charset
picture (or, if they do, then the picture will start
separating when larger sizes are used). This is not
a case where simple "solutions" were overlooked.

¬?ˆ1) What need is there for the large grid editor 'coarse

   to 8?16)

2) Why is the normal grid editor designed so that it is
   impossible to design characters which are vertically
   connected in a continued -write-?

3) What is at least one other consideration (Any one!) which
   might change this picture?

   I am not saying that these changes would solve all
   problems connected with linesets, but there are two
   specific ways which these changes would help:?
     Making large linechars which 'fit' multi character
     sizes (muliples fo 8 and 16) and bringing home to the
     user that 9?17 dot linechars can be used with mulit-
     line writes which are horizontally and vertically

Another thing you can do is to insert (probably at the

   ?  is assignment arrow
   ! is exclamation point
   ¬< is less than or equal

etc... Then when the print is made you will have an

to place within a feature that could so easily garbaginate

I don't have any published lessons that this would help.
But it would help GREATLY in a lesson I have that transfers
control to variable units found in a data base. My current
implementations is to store a "unit number" and then the
lesson will transfer control using a HUGE 15-line -jump-
statement.

When a key designated as a Jkey" is pressed after a "no"
judgement (when you see the "no" on the screen, in this
case), the response is erased and you're back in "waiting
for response" mode. The "jump key=help" is ONLY executed
upon pressing HELP after entering a non-storeable string
at the arrow and before pressing NEXT.

Because you have an "inhibit anserase" at the arrow, the
response is not erased from the screen as you would expect.

It would be nice if there were a rotatable graphing package.
This would not only permit animation of graphs around the
screen but would simplify the plotting of isometric
projections of 3 dimensional graphic surfaces.

---------- response 1
  06/06/76     23.05     shirer       s

   Those of us concerned with graphics had a long discussion
some months ago as to whether we would ever make the graphs
-rotate-able. Several points to consider:
   Tests show that the labels are unreadable with more than
45¬0 rotation unless the labels continue to plot horizontally
even though the graph is rotated.
   Think of all the hundreds of lines drawn during labeling.
Then think of all the many hundreds of cosine/sine multiplys
necessary to convert these.
   Very few people have asked for a rotatable graph package.
   We are considering alternate ways of handling 3D views.

   The conclusion was that we did not think the need for
rotating the graph stuff was pressing enough to do it this
summer, but we are keeping our options open and not going
on record as saying it will never be done. I wil be glad
to store all pnotes on this subject in our (in)action file.

Hope no one will take offense, but the new -box- command
and its brothers, -rbox- and -gbox-, seems to be a step
backwards in the movement to create a simple yet powerful
graphics package. Three new commands that do nothing but
draw boxes? I suppose it will save a word of disk space,
but as much as I like the addition of new language features,
this one seems superfluous.

---------- response 1

   No one will take offense at all because there were
meetings and arguments over a period that now dates
back months with regard to possible changes in the
various graphics commands. The final decision was to
abandon the initial attempt at somehow collapsing the
existing absolute, relative, and graphing schemes into
fewer commands and to proceed with at least producing
a consistent set of command and names (like draw, rdraw,
and gdraw) in all three realms. You will note that
(r,g)box is the extension of the frame command from
a graphing only command into one also available when
using absolute or relative addressing.
   We all feel that this attempt at producing some
consistency is a worthwhile starting point.

Out of morbid curiousity, why wasn't an optional third

thickness would be outwards from the 2 points specified,
except when the first args location was higher and to the
right of the second, so that whatever was inside of the
box wouldn't be messed up....

Here is an oddity I noticed that does not do any harm but
which the system people might want to fix anyway:

I created a 510 word common.
I went into it to edit.
It said "length=644".
Later, I went in again (after condensing, but I am not sure
that it was the condensing that changed things; it might
have been something else).
It said "length=510".

As I said, just another little oddity of the PLATO system.

---------- response 1
  06/07/76     10.15     warner       iu

        I can answer that one.
        Common comes on the disk in blocks of 322 words.
That means, when you create a common of length n, where
322<n<644, the length on the disk will be 2 blocks, or
644 words.
        Now, when you go to _use_ the common, it is taken out
to ECS. In ECS there are no blocks, so exactly the length
of common requested is pulled off the disk and taken to
ECS.
        The common editor does subtly different things
dependng on whether the common involved is in ECS or not.
If it is not, the disk version is pulled with its 644-
word length. If it is, the eCS version with its length
is used.
       When you condensed the lesson, you pulled 510
words off the 644-word disk common to create a 510-word
ECS common. The common editor will then edit the ECS
common until it is returned by the system.

---------- response 2
  06/07/76     12.08     travers       mxc

Ummm, it's not quite true that there are no block in ECS.
You will get charged for 338 words for any short common,
and I think (I haven't tested) that it will always round
up your length to the nearest multiple of 332 and add a
few words. However, your common _length_ (value of lcommon,
limit that you can reference) is still what you've specified
in your -common- command.

        For those considering the problem of the

look at the proposed conversion of -vector- commands
now being tested during non-prime time.
        The conversion is so set up that a lesson using
-vector- could become obsolete when the conversion is
done, but prevent it from running properly during prime
time before the conversion is made.
        It would not only be nice, it would be almost
mandatory, to have the ability to change 'versions'
of a lesson in which students are now running
depending on whether it is prime time or not. How
about at least

and stop condensing=======_====_ __________ until another -unit- command was en-
countered.
This would be useful for lessons which -use- code, and would
like to make small changes without having to copy entire
blocks of code. It would also simplify some debugging
procedures.
An alternative way to accomplish this, which may involve
less changes to the condensor, would be to have a
duplicate unit _replace_ the previous one logically. This
would probably leave the previous unit in the binary taking
up space, but it would make using the -define- of -use-d
code simpler.
        Any comments?

There is nothing wrong with leaving it as it is.

Currently, if there is a duplicate unit name, the code
does get condensed in both units, and rather than leaving
code out, it is better to leave it in (albeit less
accessable).

---------- response 2

No, Travers' point is that presently we merrily go on
condensing, adding the contents of the duplicate unit
to the preceding unit, so that the preceding unit is
loused up by this unwanted addition. We should stop
condensing until the next (valid) unit command.

Stopping condensing until another -unit- is encountered
would be far preferable to the way it is done now.

Only one problem -- when a duplicate -entry- is encountered
should the code after that get condensed? If so, that
may make the unit too long. If not, the code will
certainly not work, especially if the -entry- is simply
there to break up a 'too long' unit. Maybe just change
the name of the entry?

I would like to hear other people's ideas about this.

Another pnote file (udtutor) is full. It seems strange
that so many people ignore that (annoying) exploding letter

Could someone add to it the directions:
   Press Shift-HELP while reading a note, to delete it.

  No, I think it is...sometimes authors are born with little

times one who has been on the system a while begins to take
things for granted, possibly not realizing what needs to be
explained.

But that option already exists, and it's obviously not
enough. Should a course director have to keep checking
the number of notes in all of his courses? Putting in
the message I suggested would probably do wonders, without
any extra intervention, on the other hand.

Remember, new people might think that pressing HELP is
sort of an act of desperation. Few authors realize that
you should look in HELP at least once every place you see
it. (Else why would you keep seeing people type "F31"
instead of "?" in the editor?) Just the other day, an
author who's been using pnotes for a week asked me how to
delete them.

Again, saying that people aren't doing things right doesn't
solve anything. In the case of full pnotesfiles, where
things get out of hand, an especially visible reminder to
use HELP is necessary, at least. ¬???==??Dan===¬=I=['="]=ˆˆ_

   This would require a good deal of work (regardless

which can generate output go ahead and generate it--it

        It is the responsibility of the systems staff to
see that system resources are distributed fairly. They
are presumably helped by site directors and others who
will prevent abuses such as gaming during heavy-use hours.
It is certainly not YOUR business to regulate what others
can/cannot do on plato, other than whatever authority you
exert on the med people (poor devils).

        I don't quite know what you are trying to imply by
"trying to make points with someone." Are you referring to
anybody in particular?

i suspect that the major concern of the "system people"
is to keep PLATO running and they don't particularly
care whether it crunches lesson bits or game programs.
*
the trouble is that what goes on in one site does indeed
affect the level of performance which all users receive
because the resources guaranteed to each user by the
software are totally inadequate for all but the
most rudimentary lessons. (if you doubt that, try to
edit or go through a lesson on 2 tips or 1300 words ecs.
for example). thus service quality is matter of competition
for overflow resources. when people use games, service 
for other users degrades appreciably and they are
inconvenienced. it is my personal value judgement
that this should either be prevented by software or
advertised to prospective future purchasers of
PLATO service _before_ they but--

i also don't understand why this sort of discussion 
invariably degenerates into personal squabbles. far
from being the ogre i am pictured to be with respect
to games, i personally wrote the first detailed game
index for the medical site and have continually
argued for the sort of software tools that would 
permit students to use games without interfering

Well, I guess I have to agree with Hody for a change
because I have been hassled here at CERL trying to get a
terminal away from kids playing games during non-prime
time. True, after enough hassle, and lots of grief I get
one, but why should I have to put up with that? Typically,
unless I don't have any forseeable time in the near future,
I just leave rather than go through it all. I play some of
the games a fair amount, but _never_ when there are others
standing around looking for a terminal to work on. I follow
the posted rules at CERL if I am game playing, unlike many
of the people who game play there when I am trying to work.

The new addition to -box- makes it a fairly useful command.
It will be a real time saver!

Has anyone else noticed that on the index of systems notes,
it shows the first -box- note as having a response and
yet it seems not to exist?!?

From the description, the "thickness" argument has a mixed
meaning, Two unmixed meanings are available, and one of 
them might even increase the usefulness of the command a bit
further:
   1) (less desirable) Let 0 draw the standard box, positive 
arguments draw the standard box plus _n_ larger boxes, nega-
tive arguments draw the standard box plus _n_ smaller boxes.
   2) (more desirable) Let 0 draw no box at all, let 1 and
-1 both draw the standard box, let _n_ draw the standard box
plus (_n_-1) larger boxes and -_n_ draw the standard box plus
(_n_-1) smaller boxes.

  06/08/76     11.31     clark       lawyer

hmmm. I kind of like the first one myself. One thing that
might be nice would be to add an argument which would
specify the number of dots to skip between two or more
boxes:

box 1020;1440;5;2

Would draw 5 boxes with one "box" between each of them.

---------- response 4
  06/08/76     11.43     david       cerlcc

But the second method allows an EXTREMELY simple way 
to do a "conditional" box. This added option would
be very useful, and in keeping with the general tutor
trend.

---------- response 5
  06/08/76     11.48     golden       s

I think the way it is implemented is fine, but if I were to 
change it, I would do away with thickening toward the 
outside. If all thickening were done inside, you can still
draw any box, but you gain the advantage that the first two
arguments definitely tell the extent of the box. That will
help in designing other nearby displays.

This would also remove the need for a signed thickness
argument.

---------- response 6
  06/08/76     12.35     b sherwood       s

Except that the normal use of -box- is to highlight text,
which is usually done in coarse grid, and you want
to give the -box- coordinates also in coarse grid,
but without encroaching on the enclosed text.....

All of which argues for going outward.
As far as the 3rd argument is concerned, I feel the 
present way is fine, but I can see some question (not much)
about what to do if the 3rd argument is explicitly zero
(as opposed to missing).

---------- response 7
  06/08/76     15.07     shirer       s

   Sorry guys, the meaning of the "thickness" tag will
stay the way it is for awhile, with either 1,0 (or -1)
meaning "draw one line". Even though this "wastes"
two arguments. it has the added advantage of being more
memorable. Draw "n" lines is much easier to remember 
than draw "n+1" or "n-1" lines.

   The request for a "0" tag meaning draw NO box is valid
in some situations, but right now I detect blank and zero
tags the same way. If a mob descended upon me and insisted
upon this I could kludge up a fix, though for now I will
leave it as it is.

    I am also NOT going to act quickly on the request for a
FOURTH tag field to specify skipped spaces. I will promise
to think about this, though. Thanks for the suggestions.

       A remark.
       -box- does not autobreak.
       A -box- with a 3rd argument greater than 94
(by actual test) overflows the TUTOR output buffer.
       Mind you, I do not thing this is a Bad Thing.

   Aha! Silas fell into the trap!

I deliberately did not put a limit on the number of lines
that could be drawn just to see who would be first to
bump up against the limit. I am thinking of establishing
a limit of 50 lines or so to prevent misabuses of the
screen. If that will discommode anyone, please let me
know. (by pnote)

Also, although noone noticed it, I am trying out the
n+1th line-writing idea (I don't like it) during prime
time and the n-th line writing idea off-prime. I shoulda
done it the other way, since I am 99; sure we will keep
the nth line tag scheme. Thus, you should not depend on

the thick line tag being exactly as it is in primetime
now until the next deadstart version of plato is
assembled.

---------- response 11
  06/09/76     13.34     gilpin       peer

If the 0-value of the thickness argument is NEVER going to
mean "draw no box at all", then the "n+1" scheme is probably
easier to understand than the original. Then the value of
the argument means "number of _extra_ thickness lines to add
(outside or inside)", and all the possible values have a
consistent interpretation: 1 means add a thickness line
outside, and -1 means add a thickness line inside.

---------- response 12
  06/09/76     14.59     michael       english

Disagree. The tag "3" would intuitively tell me that the 
box will be three lines thick.

But what would you do intuitively with -1 or 0?

(Not that I claim there is any really large difference
between the two alternatives being considered; my first

the original form of the command...albeit one that turned
on an incorrect intuition re what to do with -1.)

I'm gonna add my 2?ˆ345678?? cents....

If I were designing the command, it would have a minimum
of 2 args, and a maximum of say 64. The first 2 would 
naturally specify corners. The next would specify the number
of boxes to draw, inwards if -, outwards if +, 0 if 0.
The next would specify boxes to not draw, in the same
manner, and the the rest would continue the alternation.
This might be as generalized a manner as could possible,
and would take care of the generally desired boxes spaced
around boxes, with a minimum volume of code. Shouldn't be
too difficult a change to make either. In any case, the
number you specify had better be the number of boxes you,
or I will be very pissed at having to learn another tooter
idiosyncracy.

The new "accounts" feature allowing the accounts director
to press a letter to access files that begin with that
letter is a nice feature. It might even be better to
allow more than one letter to be pressed (followed
by -NEXT-) to access other files. With the City
Colleges course accounts we have separate accounts for
each campus and begin each file with an appropriate
letter (e.g. k = kennedy-king). Thus pressing any
letter will not help us hunt for a particular course.

About 3 years ago, here at The University of Iowa, we
attempted to get a cybernetic art course going and found
that the interactive nature of the system made development
of tools for artistic transformations almost a hundred
times more efficient than using "conventional" Calcomp/IBM
systems. ie: turn around for a plot generated using
something like Fortran with BAL subroutines doing output
meant an average of 24 hours/feed-back cycle as opposed
to a few minutes on PLATO. Needless to say it allowed
much more evolved compositions to be developed.

The only problem with the course was that we had to
fight art scholars steeped in dogma to get money and
had virtually no help (if not hinderance) from the
computer dept. For example: I had to change my major
from general studies to CS to get anyone to listen to
my ideas and/or help me with problems.

  06/08/76     14.00     b sherwood       s

People may be interested in some aspects of the recent
demo in Iran. It was run by RCA Globcom satellite between
a ground station in western Iran and a ground station in
Virginia, with land lines in Iran and the US to complete
the connection between Teheran and the Minneapolis PLATO
system. Round trip echo time was measured to be about
0.75 seconds, of which 0.5 seconds is due to the fact
that a "synchronous" satellite orbits at a radius of
42500 km (the radius at which the period is one day).
Delays in land lines and modems contribute additional
delay, and there is finally the typical 0.13 second
response time of PLATO itself.

---------- response 1
  06/08/76     14.07     b sherwood       s

I found that working with this delay was uncomfortable
but tolerable since the delay was constant and one can
"type ahead". Occasionally we ran on the Urbana computer
by switching the US land line to Urbana, and in this
configuration we used a different keyset return rate
(120 bits/sec) which added another 0.1 second of delay.
Running at this delay (about 0.85 sec) I found nearly
intolerable: the keyset "felt" full of molasses and glue.

We also occasionally ran on the Urbana system (to
demonstrate some experimental system software designed
for leftward-going languages such as Persian, Arabic, and
Hebrew) thru a "software link". You may know that there
is a 4800 bit/sec link between the Minneapolis and Urbana
systems used mainly for transferring files back and forth.
It can also be used to run a terminal on one system even
tho connected to the other system.

---------- response 2
  06/08/76     14.10     b sherwood       s
With the software link the delay time was similar to that
experienced running on the Minneapolis system -- not
comfortable but tolerable.

Among the people who saw the demonstration was the prime
minister of Iran, who impressed us with his quickness and
intelligence. He was particularly taken with the language
capabilities of PLATO and would like to use it right away
to teach English. Whether that converts into a PLATO
system in Iran of course remains to be seen!

you type something, then erase it, then the judging
mechanism that would normally check to see if
is as (U,N,P,E,G,L, et cetera) no longer is in effect

The lesson is still under construction and the only
topics which are 'completed' are Coal, and= Nuclear
Fission. Solar will be completed by july 76.
I will apprecitate all responses concerning the technical
accuracy(bearing in mind that this is an intro level
course),grammar,or tips on better Tutor programming.
The lesson name is eiu13 at present.
Thanks

        I have just suffered through the entire lesson.
1. Make your displays much faster in some areas.
2. In one instance, apparently, the two tag erase command
   was used to erase the entire screen which is brutal.
3. The lesson does not flow smoothly. Sometimes it was
   necessary to hit next twice to continue and sometimes
   this resulted in having writing go off the screen as
   fast as it came on.
4. Please color your sun in with characters and not lines!
5. Some displays were fairly nice I must add.

Yes perhaps pnotes would be better for personal remarks.
Still and all, there is a vital need for discussion of
the possible shortcomings lessons may have.
The PLATO community must express its concern for
quality code by developing a habit and terminology
for criticizing lessons (where criticism means analysis
rather than carping).

   Just curious about the a) feasibility and b) desirability
of making it possible to print out a person's personal notes
directly from "prints" (without 'S'aving it to another
file space). This option would be nice for people who
would ratther clutter up the files with useless code,
rather than with useless notes. It would also be nice
for account directors who cry at the thought of all
those parts containing saved notes (or being reserved
by the author for incoming pnotes) with space alloted/used
reading 4023/4157. Ok?

Something along this line is being planned, though I'm

A program to print group notes is working and is currently
being used to print out the old general notes files. There
is still quite a bit of work to do before it can be released
for general use, however.

unit       test
arrow      1010
specs
judge      judged,ok,wrong,no
answer     the answer

No answer markup occurs for this arrow if you type in the
wrong answer but the system variables (extra, spell, etc.)
are still set correctly, Why is this so?

curious as to why the above happens.)

I don't understand your comments Paul. What I am saying
is why, if the system has just judged something as wrong
(due to a misspelling or unrecognized word), should a
-judge no- prevent the automatic answer markup. The
judgement was already "no" so why should the extra
emphasis with the -judge- take away the answer markup?

I'm not kidding around. It just seems rather strange that
the above should occur.

I think you missed the "No" in "No answer markup occurs".

I can't find documentation on this anywhere, (AIDS, The
Tutor Language, and Summary of Tutor Commands are all
rather unhelpful here) but I suspect that -judge-,
regardless of its tag, always inhibits markup. It's
easy enough to understand when you're dealing with
judge ignore/continue/rejudge etc., but I agree that
the effect is somewhat peculiar when dealing with
judge ok/no/wrong.

      When a new feature is installed in the system, it
generally takes a few days to put a reasonable description
in -aids- , and up to a few weeks to piece together all
other author helps that it interacts with such as -SD-.
The Tutor coding,the -aids- writeup and the other
helps are generally not done by the same person, so it
depends on the interaction and work loads of several
people to complete the entire process.

A problem:
        I'm changing some data in a permanent common, and,
for the sake of argument, let's say it's late at night. I
realize I've just made a MASSIVE error, so I go to my
hidden -term- (or whatever), and do an -abort common-.
        Ok, now I go back to redo the work I've just
fouled up, but the copy of common will be the ABORTED
copy. So the changes I now make (hopefully the right ones
this time) won't be saved. Not good.

of waiting for a crash? (Remember, it's late at night, so
I probably won't get bumped from ECS for a LONG time.)

I don't quite understand the use of "*format pages".
What is the difference between this and *format eject?
What conditions will cause a page eject using "pages"

---------- response 1
  06/09/76     16.25     woolley       p
An "eject" just causes a single page eject wherever it
is encountered. The new "pages" option specifies that
an automatic eject will be done at the end of each page.
This leaves a few lines empty on the bottom of the page
and on the top of the next page. Without "*format pages",
there is no break in printing from one page to the next.

Note that you only have to put in "*format pages" once.
After it has been specified, it stays in effect throughout
the rest of the print.

I am sure that your everyday unsuspecting student might
realize that other students are operating in the room, or
barring that, I am certain he would have to press next at
least to make sure that PLATO was "not available". Besides,
I thought that system did an automatic backout to Press
NEXT to begin from that page after several minutes. I could
be wrong of course, but that has been my experience.

         It is not possible directly -- there has been a lot
of general talk about a command that could alter information
in a course, but no implementation yet. What is commonly
done, if the inelegance of the system's variable editor is
too much, is to have a dataset, or common, or something,
with a directory of changes that are to be made to the stu-
dents' router (or student) variables upon initial signon.
A copy of the edited variables is transferred into the stu-
dent's rvars if there were changes in the time s/he was
signed off. Any other solutions?

I notice that my note sparked off a little discussion.
It would seem to me that writing a students block back
out to disk with the changed router variables in it

If so, it should be relatively easy to write just one
block.

Security is already implemented in the readset command.

Obviously, it's not the difficulty of writing a block of
information to a disk. The problem (as I understand it)
is the interaction of writing on a signon record, with the
possibility that the user may in fact sign on while work
is in progress. (However, that problem exists in the
system course editor, and has not been solved. In the
system course editor, it is possible to change a signon
and have the user sign on while the change is being made.)

the ground on a wall socket is sometimes (often?) not
grounded at all, due to construction oversight or whatever.
also, the keysets are not always grounded to the terminals.
but, the keysets shouldn't have anything more lively than
+5v running around them, so i suspect the wall socket is
your problem

Also, grounded sockets are notorious for providing
unreliable grounding if they are used very often. The
description suggests the possibility of both an ungrounded
socket and a wiring foul-up within the socket (so the
common lead on one terminal is connected to the "hot"
side of the line). Have your local electrical inspector
check this.

implemented. It is possible that at some future date, we
may make it easier to communicate with the music box. A
clearing function would certainly be provided in this
structure.?
The real problem here is that, for technical reasons, one
cannot send even a few frames of output from a finish unit,
and therefore cannot clear the music box on a "stop1 exit."?
I think that it would be proper for the rest of this
discussion, and any future discussions of this nature to be
carried on in gnotes file "gswnotes," as they are not of
general applicability.

I suggest the introduction of a group notes file
dealing with lesson criticism directly. There should be
a lesson-of-the-week or -month (perhaps anonymous,
but anyway volunteered by the author) and the group
notes file should be concerned with discussion of
the ¬beauties of the lesson and any possible improvements.

I had a problem today with a course using the system router,
mrouter. I had a number of students with identical
individual sequences. They all completed the same lesson
at the same time, and all passed a required test at the
end. All of the students but one were sent to the next
lesson in sequence. That one student was sent back to the
lesson he had just completed. When I checked his records,
there was an asterisk by the lesson indicating he had
completed it, and a score of 100 from the test. When the
student signed back in, he was sequenced ok. I changed
nothing in the student's records. Can someone eplain this?

        Also, I would like to know if other people have
problems with mrouter, as we seem to have more than our
share.

to another student running in the automotive course (here)
and to a third student running in either the math or

these incidents all happened last semester, and were
so freaky and isolated, we figured that the cause was
just one of those times plato burps instead of bytes.

In physics we run hundreds of students reliably under

---------- note 390 sort order
  06/10/76     10.44     guerra       uimc

After execution of the -sort- command on a series of words,
words with equal keys are not arranged in any particular
order. That is to say, for all practical purposes, words
with equal keys are arranged in random order, as opposed to
being ordered with respect to their position in the original
list or anything like that. HOLD IT! Before you all jump
on me for complaining about this, let me make it clear
that I am NOT complaining about this. In fact, what I
want to know is if I can count on the -sort- command always
working like this. I have an applications where the -sort-
command, if left as it is, can be used to "scramble" a list
of words that are to be arranged in groups according to
one of the fields, but are to be in "random" order among
words having equal fields. Can I indeed count on the -sort-
command always working like this?

---------- response 1
  06/10/76     14.26     sherman       mcl

i would have prefered that the -sort- command be structured
such as most sort/merge package programs (i.e. IBM) are,
mainly that successive tags (lines) are additional
keys (fields) on which to act in cases of "ties" of
previous fields. this would allow you to precisely sort
your data and not have to worry about this random ordering.
however, i suppose you could follow one sort command with
another acting on the field which could result in "ties".
i also realize that the kind of sort im refering to requires
additional work areas.

sorry about that.... you merely raised an issue which

---------- response 6
  06/10/76     15.26     guerra       uimc

I still want an answer to my question. I seem to remember
that the -sort- command uses a technique called Shell's
sort, and I know enough about Shell's sort to know that
this result is to be expected, and that it might actually
require extra comparisons (i.e. use more CPU time) to get
any more refined results. I simply want to know whether
the algorithm is likely to change or not.

Secondly, what's warped about using a systems feature in
a way that no one had anticipated? How do you know how
I'm preparing the list that I'm going to scramble? If
a command does exactly what I want it to do, and saves
a whole lot of CPU time to boot, what's wrong with using
it? Admittedly, the technique is based on a side effect
of the command, but if this side effect is something I can
depend on, there's no risk in using it. That's why I
asked my question.

        A defined function apparently cannot have an
element of a two-dimensional array for an argument. The
following code gives an error of unequal number of
arguments:

unit   test

       add(b)=b+1
calc   n10?add(array(1,1))

        Apparently,the comma between the array dimensions
cause  PLATO to see two arguments. However, this doesn't
happen for system-defined functions.
        Is this a known error and/or is there any way
around it?

   It is not an error. From the first days that arrays
were announced, it was noted that they were only guaranteed
to work in -calc- -show- and a few other places. As
opportunity occurs, I keep expanding the number of "other
places" where they are legal, but defines is not yet one
of them. Problem is that I am not here full time and
no-one else has time on their hands to work in this area.

One thing I'll say about chess 4p2 is that it certainly
does not lack for aggressiveness during the opening (and
even into the middle game), but once you have it whipped
it almost seems to become "demoralized" and at times becomes
almost passive.

  In case there are people who do not know it, the
Northwestern chess program series developed by Dave
Slate and Larry Aikin has won the annual computer
chess championship staged at the ACM each and every one
of the several years the contest has been in existence.
 No doubt our version is not "tuned" nor as complete
as their competition entry, but it is a pretty amazing
job nonetheless--chess is really a very tough challenge
to program to play even at the expert level, let alone
master level.
  Of course the story on checkers is quite different,
with Samuels program reaching equivalence with championship
play quite some years ago now.

     It is my present understanding that an arrow during
which the touch/ext devices are -enable-d will treat any
ext input like a jkey. I have a repeatable instance of
ext input keys being ignored and thrown out of the
key buffer in such an instance.
      Is there any way to ensure that ext inputs are
treated as jkeys? The command

In response to some of the thoughts brought out in note
number 205 I just made a survey of room 165 CERL and found
that but of 25 individuals at terminals 11 are playing
games. Of those 11 at least 5 of them are not old enough
to be in college, and two of them don't look old enough
to be in high school. Since it is 1:10 pm I believe that
CERL rules are being violated, but there is no one here
monitoring what is happening. The problem of game-playing
is one of control, or the lack of it, and deleting games
in any way is not the solution, better control is. I don't
feel that other users should be responsible for reporting
on, or spying on, other users. CERL makes the rules, and
so CERL must enforce them. Certainly everyone must do
their part, but who wants to take the time to watch all
the terminals and see what is going on?

of system resources, and their obnoxious behavior and yet
you attempt to "pass the buck". I have found that if I need

then tell them to leave. You would be suprised to see how

Dr. Marty's statement about problems with gameplayers proves
nothing. We never had any troubles on Sundays,  when Mike
and I were in charge of insuring that there were enough
terminals available. I do remember getting a lot of flak
from two or three chemistry students, but not one gamer
ever gave me a hard time.

By his logic, I would assume that chemistry students are
about to get restricted. This has not happened...

not doing our job correctly and that students were waiting

Jim g may feel that it should be normal course of events

advantage of the system because "operators" are overworked,
but I don't buy that. That is their job and if they are
overworked then someone had better start considering adding

Read lesson "policy": this contains an explanation of

keep most people happy.

I have always felt that it is important to be reasonable
with students. and tell them the full story rather than
just throwing them out with a stern "No games!" message.

Of course, a student is more likely to cooperate when 
you say

"Sorry, but we are short of memory, and need your space
for language students. Please seek another site."

than when you simply back him out, as some people have
done who monitor over here. I think that the game problem

It doesn't  have to be at the expense of serious programming.

As I pointed out, I always found that a simple, courteous
approach helped to insure that gaming did not interfere with
student use. It has been argued that gamers refuse to leave:
I know of two who cause problems, but the vast majority feel
secretly guilty, and often I don't even need to use the
backout option. It has been argued that students are too
shy to bump the gamers: if a student looks like he or she
is about to leave frustrated, it is easy enough to intercept
him or her at the door and rustle up a terminal. The major
problem is students who stand and wait even when there are
terminals available, or monitors who pretend that people on
the other side of the enemy.

There is more involved here than a question of courtesy...
A great deal was made of the fact that lessons should
be secure...that access to a lesson should be at the
discretion of the author.

Furthermore, as we all know, a great fuss has been made
about keeping p-notes secure, so that even the account
director could not get access.

Note files fall under the same category -- there should
be NO way that an account director can change the
access list of someone else's file. Pershaps there are
things in that file that he/she is not supposed to see.
What security do we have then?

No doubt. The notefile in question contained what could

by several diverse types of PLATO authors -- not really
an accurate representation of the PLATO system, if such
a thing can be measured by one person's eyes, but perhaps
not too far off the norm for us as authors, when we con-

emotionally atached to the system. Absolutely nothing
present in the file was derogatory of PLATO... in fact,
little of it "made sense" from the "normal" point of view.

The system programmers have an interest

   To re-iterate and re-emphasize a couple of points:
access to group notes cannot be changed by anyone
other than the notes director(s) and similarly course
directors cannot read anyone's personal notes. It is
intended by the system staff that these points of privacy
be observed and enforced to the best of our ability. In
the related case of monitoring, our policy since the
very beginning has been to guarantee that anyone being
monitored at least receive a message displaying this fact.
It is also intended that the capability of the system
staff to read and write the disk be invoked only in cases
of emergency to aid persons whose needs/rights can be
verified. Interference by a staff member in this particular
case may not have been appropriate; however, it still should
be noted that an accounts director does have the power
to destroy any file in his account.

  This is certainly not the first time files have been
changed without notification of the author ( director,
manager, responsible person in charge ). Such authority
must be checked somewhere along the line. More than one
department which the language lab supposedly serves is
displeased with the management policies here. Yet, they
have no control over what lessons get done, or how policies
are set. Evidence clearly shows that certain departments
get the shaft, while others bask in the limelight (which
is to say nothing of the quality of the lessons themselves).

   On top of this, the course will not even use PLATO next

   WOW! We are all coming on like the righteous savior
at present. Like nobody has made mistakes before.
Believe me, I have made my mistakes, including a few
things done on this system which should not have happened.
However, since then, I think I have grown up a little.
I admitted where I went wrong, and there has been no
repeats. I hope other people can learn from their
mistakes and grow up also...mainly the people who have
such administrative responsibilies and yes, power.
   I do hope other people (and IU is starting to make
these same mistakes) can learn from these recent
disclosures, made public by the last 2 notes.
I plan on learning...about maybe how NOT to run an account!

is more a matter of common sense, and not a matter of

        Of course as I stated before, I feel this thing

I think the real element for concern is courtesy and a
little empathy for others. When I left for a year to
teach in the Chicago area I had arranged for local
terminal use, and had gotten approval from my UI course
to maintain my sign-on through them so I could continue
working, which I did regularly, on my lessons. About
half-way through the year my sign-on was deleted without
warning, or so much as a tough luck. Fully within their
rights, but very discourteous. Meanwhile my lessons,
totally developed on my own time, were in use on the
system...really nice. All we need do is think about what
we are doing, and how it will effect others, is that so

1. Since Prof. Myers is out of the country on sabbatical,
and therefore cannot defend himself, it is clear that public
criticisms directed against him are in the nature of "cheap

this note and the preceding one were given notice of term-
ination a few weeks ago. Thus, what looks like courageous
whistle-blowing may be merely spiteful troublemaking.

The response ¬$26 to this note is very much in error. I
am truly taken aback that someone can make such claims
without knowing the truth. ¬$26 is less than a "cheap shot."

1. Dr. "myers is not on sabbatical yet. He is not out of

   himself.

2. I for one, never got any such "notice of termination."
   In fact, I am one of only two (that I know of) who have
   been give a research assistantship for the coming year.

3. It is only my desire that the langlab be a better place
   for the students who use the lab, and those who TRULY
   know what is going on at the lab would not be so quick
   to make such accusations as in ¬$26. My personal

        Wouldn't it be extremely valuable to be able to
compare the processing times of Tutor commands and oper-
ations? Such information could be in Aids, where one
would have the option to type in choices to be compared.
Authors could help supply such data by conducting their

As execution time (which is what I believe you mean)
varies greatly depending on a lot of uncontrollable
variables (how busy is the CPU, what version is currently
loaded, how big your time slice happens to be, whether
the operator's 'no games'message appears, and heck-uv-a
lot of things I don't care to go into right now), your
request is undoubtedly doomed to failure. It is, however,
a nice idea, and I suggest you concentrate on comparative
execution times like -doto- instead of -do- where the
-do-ne unit is used iteratively and isn't used often enough
to justify by disk savings. Also, follow good general
programming practices like keeping loops as small as
possible, pulling out stuff that should be done only
once, etc. Jerry

        Certainly the execution time of various commands
depends on a variety of factors, but I am speaking in
relative terms not absolute ones. For example, the _ratio_
of processing time between "add1" and "calc a?a+1" is
about 10 to 1 (last I checked) regardless of CPU power, etc.

        The information you seek is dependent solely
on the system program and the hardware of the computer.
However, the determination of the ratios could only
be done accurately if you were alone on the system
for only then would the CPU be devoted to you alone. Any
attempt to measure the speed of commands during normal
use must take into account the processing being devoted
to the other users.

I talked to many people about the possibility of data
like this being included in AIDS. The main problem
is that everyday there are changes made to the system
which MIGHT effect the speed of N commands either for
better of for worse. For the AIDS people to keep up
with this type of information would be a virtually
impossible task. What I would suggest you do is
simply create a block in a lesson of yours and include
a general timing loop where you can compare 2 sequences
of code.

To put it succinctly, there ARE a number of things that an
author can do to make his program faster or smaller -- but
nowhere is there even a one-page checklist of hints. The
only thing I have seen is the precaution about -calcs-. The
things I have picked up along this line have been piece-
meal, like in responses to public notes, talko (yes) and
TERM talk. Okay, so Tutor is changing, but there are some
things that will probably never change, like interpreting
most everything but calc statements (which are compiled).
I understand that something is being planned that will tell
us how Tutor works... I would also like to know how WELL
Tutor works.

   This topic comes up every so often, so evidently some
people worry very much about "optimizing" code to make it
run "efficiently". Please consider the following:

1. Although at times processing power is tight, we are
   making progress toward giving you more.

2. The best way to write code is the most straightforward
   and understandable way. The time spent debugging and
   trying to puzzle out obscure "optimized" code is not
   worth the couple of microseconds you pick up.

3. Old commands are occasionally re-written to take ad-
   vantage of some new feature, so we could not always
   say that one way is fastest. Example: -zero- used to be
   painfully slow compared to -calc- , yet when it
   was re-written to allow block zeroing, it is much
   faster for multi-variable zeroing.

If a program doesn't work well because of taking up too
much processing time, I have nearly always found that
improvements in lesson design yeild order of magnitude
improvements...while fiddling with the coding is a sure
sign of defeat or incompetence. The only exception I
know of is in coding that makes up the great execution
bulk of a lesson. For example, the TIPS-load of the TUTOR
editor is totally determined by the "block-display" and
the "source-line" display. Hence, these two units have
been carefully worked on...the other hundreds of units
don't matter!

CERL Elementary Reading Project

Wednesday, June 16
CERL room 351--3pm

Abstract:
the plato elementary reading project has been learning
how to use audio with cai lessons for the past five
years. we have developed several ideas about how to make
audio effective in a lesson. the ideas are derived
from standard programmed instruction principles, and from
a bit of common sense; and while they primarily apply
to presenting information via audio, they also have
implications for presenting textual information too.

in this paper, we'll describe the principles and present
some data which tend to support them and define their
limits.

        You can do -inhibit arrow-
-arrow -8,400-
to get text starting in column 2; but:
-arrow -16,400-, while starting the text in column 1,
also 'sets the right margin' at column 2, so that the
characters show one top of one another in column 1.
        That reminds me:
        When will we be able to set the right margin?

Ah hem..
With the recent arrival of the .box. command,
and some discussions of what should and should
not be used as options, I have a suggestion.

     My suggestion is to update the .circle./.circleb.
command similarly to the new .box. command.
This would include: thickness, alternations, and
possibly mode changes within the command (i.e. .circle.
to .circleb., or vice versa.)

     To clarify my ideas, I have developed some units
on what each of these would look like. They are displayed
in lesson .statq. option "c".

   Thank you. Your detailed suggestions have been noted

   Considerable work and internal discussion has been going
on recently to make the -display- type commands internally
as consistent as possible. One decision was to make the
commands as simple as possible to make them easy to use,
not tack on complicating tags which only a few people would
remember.

   You might also look at the discussion of -ncircle- in
system announcements and in -aids-. If we do adopt your
suggestion, it would probably be in the form:
   at       xcenter,ycenter
   circle   radius;thickness

the graphics in the lesson are attractive but it is
of concern that most generate slowly on the current
terminals. there are already far too many lessons
which feature dazzling though snail-paced graphics
with little added instructional value and great expenditure
of ecs, disk, and tips. this is not to discourage the
development of new display commands but to recommend
that their writeups in aids and in textbooks on TUTOR
be linked closely with warnings about the problem
of plotting time. title and index pages of lessons are
a special problem area because they are often seen
multiple times in the course of moving through or repeating
a lesson" incidentally, the box command doesn't have this
problem because the line drawing mode is so fast. in
keeping with that observation, i'd like to suggest
a "lineh" and a "linev" command to draw straight lines
¬D

---------- response 4
  06/13/76     10.25     hody       med

¬D to draw straight lines between points, with the first
arguments for the end points of the lines, the second for
thickness, and the third for number of skipped lines
between lines. of course this is easily done
in a "personal" subroutine just as was "box"--code
examples on request ...
*
of course lineh would be for horizontal lines and
linev for vertical... another way would be just
have a "linei" (pronounced, of course "illini") for
a general case which would include orthogonal lines
(though those might look a bit peculiar when
thickened)

        Is there a list in AIDS of the commands that break
student response into words (for -getword-, etc.)?
        If not, can one be set up (at least until these
commands start doing it for themselves)?
        Thanks.

the main commands that break up a student response in
judging entities are:
answer,match,concept,storen---and their derivatives.

many of the other answer commands will never do this...it
just insn't appropriate. For example, the -exact- command
is a character string matcher. Breaking up into entities
serves no purpose.

NOTE: -getword- by itelf forces the breaking of a student
response up into entities (as directed by judging symbols
(which see in AIDS))
so, perhaps the following is all you need:

arrow   1010

instructional as well as informative. In keeping with
the progress of Plato, I would hope that there would be
provisions for anyone in any part of the country to get
a reasonable idea of what the weather will be like in his
area. Perhaps this will include a US weather map, such as

on a daily basis.

Hello,
       I was wondering if there was a command like -where-

terminal number (the name in the tag):
example: 
where   nc1,blomme/s
the varible is used to store the location once found,if
the person is not on sys then -zreturn- would be set to 0.
the -who- command could be like this,
who nc1,nc2:terminal number
again nc1 is used to store the persons name,
and in this case nc2 is used to store the course.
also again zreturn might be set to 0 if no one is there.

creative author an almost infinite choice of styled
writing.

    How, if it is not a secret, are the sized writings
done? Is it performed by the terminal or the system?
And, if the system does the work, would it be possible
to have negative sizes flip the letter over? It would
make possible many interesting effects.
Thankyou.

The Plato executor currently sends line drawing commands
to the terminal to form the sized writing. Yes, negative
sizes are planned, and in fact, work for sized writing.
I have not had time to test all the other things that
would be affected by negative sizes, so it has not been
released yet.

Exactly what happens to a terminal that is too hot? The
temperature of the room I am in now is at least 30¬oC and====_=====_
the terminals show no side effects. Is there any serious
(permanent) damage that can result?

The panel and panel power supply can suffer permanent
damage if overheated. If you begin to notice display
problems, shut down immediately. The local humidity and
air flow have a lot to do with the exact temperature at
which you can expect real problems.

Don't push the terminal back against a wall. This will
block air circulation.
