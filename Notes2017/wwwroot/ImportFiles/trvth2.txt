He glanced forward again.  There were waves, though not
yet very large ones, breaking on the pebbly beach.  A
man in shirt and shorts and a pith helmet was ankle-deep
in the water, wading ashore and pulling after him a little
canvas punt.  It was certainly Weston, though his face
had something about it which seemed subtly unfamiliar.
It seemed to Ransom of vital importance to prevent a
meeting between Weston and the Lady.  He had seen Weston
murder an inhabitant of Malacandra.  He turned back,
stretching out both arms to bar her way and shouting
"Go back!"  She was too near.  For a second she was
almost in his arms.  Then she stood back from him, panting
from the race, surprised, her mouth opened to speak.  But
at that moment he heard Weston's voice, from behind him,
saying in English, "May I ask you, Dr Ransom, what is the
meaning of this?"

Of the many strange devices to be found in scientific
laboratories perhaps none is stranger than a certain
unimposing ring of quartz in the Bell Telephone Labora-
tories in New York.  This crystal ring divides the second
into 100,000 parts and therefore is capable of measuring
periods of a few minutes with an accuracy of one part in

5,000,000!  The standard frequency impulses of this
crystal oscillator may be sent by wire anywhere.  Thus,
for instance, high-precision electric clocks could be
checked from any point in the country by transmitting a
standard frequency over telephone wires.  Likewise,
wherever a standard frequency is desired the magic ring
stands ready to serve.  Many great broadcasting stations
now control their transmission frequency by means of it.
Indeed, wherever time or frequency measurements are made
or compared, this one magic ring may serve as the master
for the entire country.                        -- Scientific American, July, 1934

Our civilization, bequeathed to us by fierce adventurers, eaters of meat
and hunters, is so full of hurry and combat, so busy about many things
which perhaps are of no importance, that it cannot but see something feeble
in a civilization which smiles as it refuses to make the battlefield the
test of excellence.

My conclusion, hardly original, is that the lesson of Sept 11 is in many
ways the same as the lesson from Columbine:  In the modern world, it is
not safe to consistently shit upon any minority, no matter how despised,
how weak, or even how few.

Moving between the legs of tables and of chairs,
Rising or falling, grasping at kisses and toys,
Advancing boldly, sudden to take alarm,
Retreating to the corner of arm and knee,
Eager to be reassured, taking pleasure
In the fragrant brilliance of the Christmas tree. . . .

So, Freda the cat was loosed from the tethers of mortality this past
Tuesday.  She was about 12 years old, and had been with the family for a
little over 10 years.  A petite, black & white kitty with "tuxedo"
markings, she was the most outgoing feline member of our household.  She
was unafraid of guests or small children, and was always on the lookout for
a comfortable lap to curl up in.
 
We acquired her from the CCHS shelter as a replacement for JYC (our
junkyard cat), who had similar markings.  She was almost overlooked, but
called out to the wife and kids and reached through the bars of her cage to
wave, successfully, for attention.
 
Farewell.

When I was about four years old, we got our third cat, Samantha.  We got
her from a friend who had too many silver tabbys, and she joined our family 
a couple of months after my younger sister was born in '75.
 
She was a constant presence in our home.  She was an outdoor/indoor cat, 
and we didn't have her sterilized, so it wasn't long before her first

litter showed up.  To be honest, counting the number of times she got 
knocked up would be pretty difficult, with my being so young and the sheer
number of children, grandchildren, and great-great grandchildren that she
spawned would be difficult to count.  At one point, we had 14 cats running
around our house.  We kids got to see firsthand what birth looked like, and
we got to see what still-births were like, too.  And we got to see how a
cat dynasty formed.  Samantha was always on top.  The younger generations
knew who the top cat was, and if they didn't, they'd be the first to get a
paw to the head.
 
We kids started curbing the cat growth as we got a little older.  By around
'88, we only had three or four, but they were all descendents of Sam.  She
had her last kitten in '88.
 
 
I remember coming home from college for winter break in '90, watching SNL
with Sam on my lap.  She had gotten pretty aged: she was blind in one eye
and almost blind in the other.  She was by no means frisky anymore.  She
tended to just pick a spot and stay there.  I was petting her and thinking
that this was the same cat that came from a time when I was still a little
runt, dangling a hanger on a string for her to chase.  She'd been in this
family all this time, just as much a part as any of the rest of us.  And I
thought that she must be very very tired.
 
She passed away a couple of months later.  She's a legend in our family.
I hope that in the kitty afterlife she and Freda can get together and trade
stories.

When the housewife of 2000 cleans house she simply turns the hose on
everything.  Why not?  Furniture, rugs, draperies, unscratchable floors -
all are made of synthetic fabric or waterproof plastic.  After the water
has run down a drain in the middle of the floor, she turns on a blast of
hot air and dries everything.

A person brought up in a world without cars would be hard-pressed to agree
that the landscape created by the automobile represents human values.  Cars
spread out things to distances appropriate to cars, and intrude on our
space and our ability to appreciate the world at a scale appropriate to
pedestrians.  We tolerate them and the consequences of their intrusions
largely because we are desensitized.

Webmergers.com has come up with a 10-point list of lessons learned from the
high-tech industry failures last year:
 
    1) Prediction tools must improve.
    2) It's hugely difficult to build chicken and egg simultaneously.
    3) Venture capital firms' demands that startups generate $50 million in
        revenue within three years were unrealistic.
    4) Companies used narrowcast to broadcast.
    5) Free is folly.
    6) We all, like sheep, will go astray (with enough pressure).
    7) Many startups were fundamentally uncreative and "un-Internet."
    8) Too early to market? Too bad.
    9) New stuff doesn't replace old.
   10) Nothing changes overnight.

* Deaths in alcohol-related crashes are down from about half of all
    accidents in 1990 to 2-out-of-5 a decade later.
 
* Birth rates for teens age 15 to 19 fell to an all-time low in 1999, at
    about 50 births per 1,000.  That was 20% lower than the peak reported

is small and the shoulder can be re-habilitated immediately if

------------------------------------------
Discussion and Indications:
        - objective good to excellent results may be achieved in 
          over 70% of patients, and subjective satisfactory results are
          achieved in over 90% of patients;
        - shoulder arthroscopy is indicated in cases of impingement 
          syndrome and questionable rotator cuff tear repair, since 
          the shoulder scope will be able to determine the status 
          of the cuff, and an arthroscopic acromioplasty can be 
          performed if a cuff tear is not present.

Hey, that went great!  
 
Luckily, he found something simple and obviously wrong when he looked
inside my shoulder.  Apparently a chunk of cartilage was floating around
loose in there (how did *that* get there?).  He was able to use the
Roto-Rooter attachment, and something that looked like a steel-jawed
snapping turtle, to chew that up and suck it out through the shop-vac
looking sucky thing.

For anyone who wants the gory details, here's the injury scenario.  I was
being pulled behind a boat on an inner-tube when I was thrown off.  As I
hit the water, I (un-)wisely spread my arms to slow myself down.  When my
left arm hit the water, it got jerked straight up with respect to my body.
 
As my arm hyper-extended, the shoulder dislocated, with the head of the
humerus (upper arm bone) sheering off the superior labrum (the top portion
of the cup-shaped cartilage that forms the shoulder socket).  As my arm
continued upwards, the "long head" attachment (one of two) of my biceps
tendon was torn away.  Fortunately, the "short head" attachment survived.
 
A couple of months after the injury, I inadvertently partially dislocated
the shoulder again by moving my arm suddenly.  It appears that at this
time, the sheered off portion of the labrum (~3cm long, thickness of a
pencil) slipped down and became wedged between the head of the humerus and
the bowl of the socket.  This produced a mechanical blockage that reduced
range of motion in the shoulder joint by about 50%.
 
The surgery removed the torn labral cartilage.  Additionally, he did the
acromioplasty (and shaving of the frayed rotator cuff) to address an old,
unrelated rotator cuff injury.  Range of motion is already improved, and
the prospects look good.

to gather materials for decision, discrimination to decide, and when he has
decided, firmness and self-control to hold to his deliberate decision.

The Over 40 Geek
    Scribed by Howard Bolling
 
I take issue, my friends and your readers,
to the "over 40" poem.
I've been "gigging" since the 70's,
Probably since before you were born!
 
Client-server meant Baxters and Hazel,
Coffee was perked, not latte.
But that doesn't mean that my brain hasn't been
In computers in humongous ways.
 
So what if n-tier meant lots of steps
And a Woody was a car?
Don't you think there's something of value
In a journey that's been long and far?
 
Meg might have been your girlfriend's name
My computer only had Kay.
And cassettes were a most reliable tool
So your bits didn't get blown away.
 
Color displays meant amber or green
and that was all right with me
because MOV B,A looks the same all in gray
as it would in cyan or cerise.
 
The first mouse that I saw, I said "Is that all?
Keep the rodent thing out of my way!"
Now, optical mice (wireless is nice)
Are the rule in my cube every day.
 
I've got walls that are papered with worthless options
And made a living scaring folks with Y2K
All the startups I've known and the VC bucks I've thrown
Could make a Saudi prince rich for a day.
 
Cut? I do it with right-click

Paste? I use Control-V
I code in more dialects than many can spell
'Cause it's all only syntax to me.
 
I understand how all my tools work,
My latest computer included.
If you depend on someone who doesn't,
You're more easily deluded.
 
Although some of my buzzcut is turing to gray
My earring's still shiny and gold!
Don't imply that I'm leathered and dusty
If I'm staring at fifty years old.

Few influential people involved with the Internet claim that it is a good

as it is a tool for making money, finding lost relatives, receiving medical
advice, or, come to that, trading instructions for making bombs.

Bomb Suspect Sought 'Face' Pattern
Thu May 9, 9:16 PM ET
By SCOTT SONNER, Associated Press Writer
 
RENO, Nev. - The 21-year-old college art student accused of putting pipe
bombs in mailboxes in five states told authorities he was trying to make a
"smiley face" pattern on the map, a sheriff said Thursday.
  
The first 16 bombs were arranged in two circles, one in Illinois and Iowa
and the other in Nebraska. On a map, the circles could resemble the eyes of
the popular 1970s happiness symbol. The final two bombs, found in Colorado
and Texas, form an arc that could be the beginning of a smile.

The radio is nothing but a conduit through which pre-fabricated din can
flow into our homes.  And this din goes far deeper, of course, than the
eardrums.  It penetrates the mind, filling it with a babble of
distractions, blasts of corybantic or sentimental music, continually
repeated doses of drama that bring no catharsis, but usually create a
craving for daily or even hourly emotional enemas.

In a way, it's re-assuring to find that we knew that much about that many
of these people prior to the attack.
 
There are probably 100's of people, almost all of them innocent, who have
behaved in ways similar to the terrorists before Sept. 11.  As porous as I
perceive our borders to be, and as impossible as I believe it is to thwart
"sleepers" who prepare quietly for a sudden, suicidal assault, it's a
wonder that we knew anything about any of them.
 
So, like, the administration, by acting like they don't want to admit how
much they knew prior to Sept. 11, is working in the exact wrong direction
to ease my mind.  And, even more bizarre, this has caused the detractors to
dig up a bunch of data that are, from one perspective, re-assuring in their
very existence.

It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker,
that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.  We
address ourselves, not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never
talk to them of our necessities but of their advantages.

System Administrator Appreciation Day
http://www.sysadminday.com/
 
Friday, July 26, 2002 is your opportunity to thank your system
administrators. These are the warriors that pull all-nighters, live on
stale Mountain Dew and cold pizza in order to ensure that your morning
coffee is enjoyed at your keyboard trouble-free. By simply receiving this
newsletter via email, a lot of mice have toiled away behind the scenes to
make it happen. We endure virus infections, wrecked weekends, insolent
users, extraordinary demands of our time and abilities, and lack of
attention when budget time rolls around. IT shops are often seen as an
expensive necessity rather than the hard-working group of dedicated
technical professionals that we are. Extra hours are the norm rather than
the exception, yet we don't complain. We love what we do and without
realizing it, every other employee in a company loves what we do. As you
pass by your system administrators in the hallway, every day is an occasion
to thank them. Barring that, we have System Administrator Appreciation Day.

Frisbee Pioneer Dies, Ashes to Be Made Into Discs
Wed Aug 14, 9:02 AM ET
By Andrew Quinn
 
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - "Steady" Ed Headrick, the California inventor who
figured out a way to make the Frisbee fly fast and straight, has died at
the age of 78. His family said his ashes will be made into Frisbees.

Headrick died in his sleep early Monday at his home in La Selva Beach,
California, his son Ken told the Santa Cruz Sentinel on Tuesday.
 
While no services are now planned, Headrick's ashes will be molded into a
limited number of "memorial flying discs" that will be distributed to
family and friends, and sold to help fund a future Frisbee/disc golf
history and memorabilia museum, his son, Ken Headrick, said.

Of all the enemies to liberty war is, perhaps, the most to be dreaded,
because it comprises and develops the germ of every other. ... In war, too,
the discretionary power of the Executive is extended; its influence in
dealing out offices, honors, and emoluments is multiplied; and all the
means of seducing the minds, are added to those of subduing the force, of
the people. The Constitution expressly and exclusively vests in the
Legislature the power of declaring a state of war [and] the power of
raising armies.... A delegation of such powers [to the president] would
have struck, not only at the fabric of our Constitution, but at the
foundation of all well organized and well checked governments.

Hope is...an ability to work for something because it is good, not because
it stands a chance to succeed.  Hope is definitey not the same thing as
optimism.  It is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but
the certainty that something makes sense regardless of how it turns out.

tell you that life is a very hard and complicated thing; that no interface

UK GOVERNMENT PLANS CELL PHONE TOWER TRACKING SYSTEM
The government of the U.K. is funding secret radar technology research that
uses mobile phone masts to enable security officials to watch vehicles and
people in real time almost anywhere in Britain. The Celldar technology,
which works wherever there is cell phone coverage, "sees" the shapes made
when radio waves emitted by the towers meet an obstruction. Signals bounced
back by immobile objects, such as buildings and trees, are filtered out by
the receiver, and what's left on the screen are images of anything that
moves. When combined with technology that allows individuals to be
identified by their mobile phone handsets, the Celldar system would enable
security officials to locate and track a specific person from hundreds of
miles away.

The philosopher Jurgen Habermas provides an insight into the political
nature of gatekeeper uses of language through his identification of the
"scientization of the public sphere," a process now occurring in many
societies.  In this trend, elites effectively disqualify members of the
public from being able to participate in policy discussions by insisting
that only specialists can really understand what is going on.  When
politicians come to believe that only they can understand what is going on
in the high councils of government, and that their job is to translate it
for us and to protect themselves in the process, the language they aim at
the electorate takes on more and more aspects of purposeful deceit.

MAKE THE PIE HIGHER
by George W. Bush
 
I think we all agree, the past is over.
This is still a dangerous world.
It's a world of madmen and uncertainty
and potential mental losses.
Rarely is the question asked
Is our children learning?
Will the highways of the Internet become more few?
How many hands have I shaked?
They misunderestimate me.
I am a pitbull on the pantleg of opportunity.
I know that the human being and the fish can co-exist.
Families is where our nation finds hope,

where our wings take dream.
Put food on your family!
Knock down the tollbooth!
Vulcanize society!
Make the pie higher!

The Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Hearing on Port
Security: Shipping Containers
 
Overview
 
The United States maritime borders include 95,000 miles of open shoreline,
361 ports and an Exclusive Economic Zone that spans 3.5 million square
miles. The United States relies on ocean transportation for 95 percent of
cargo tonnage that moves in and out of the country. Each year more than
7,500 commercial vessels make approximately 51,000 port calls, and over six

million loaded marine containers enter U.S. ports. Current growth
predictions indicate that container cargo will quadruple in the next twenty
years.
 
Standard sizes of cargo containers allow cargo to be quickly transferred
from ships to trucks or railcars and transported immediately to anywhere in
the country. This rapid transfer of cargo is a possible conduit and target
for terrorist activities. Prior to September 11th, the primary focus of
intermodal transportation was the safe movement of containers in a timely
manner. As a result of the terrorist threat, the United States must develop
a security regime that minimizes the risks and consequences of a terrorist
attack without slowing the movement of cargo.

A study of the last 27 Super Bowl Sundays concluded that the highway death
rate jumped 70% in the first hour after the big game and remained high over
the next few hours.
 
The increase was particularly dramatic in states with the losing team,
where the death rate was 147% higher than on the Sundays before and after
the championship.
 
The only exception was in states with the winning team, where highway death
rates did not rise, according to Donald Redelmeier, the chief author of the
study.

[T]ech firms ... convinced Congress to allow foreign IT professionals to
come work in this country (for lower wages than their U.S. counterparts)
several years ago.  This, of course, drew jobs away from new graduates in
this country.  Despite their degrees in computer science, many of them have
been working at AutoZone car parts stores, PayLess drug stores, Costco,
etc. because there were no jobs to be had in the tech fields.  They were
always told they lacked the necessary experience for any job they sought,
even Help Desk jobs.  Some of them have been sending out resumes for
several years, while others have just given up and gone into other
fields...  Meanwhile, these CEOs have been exporting technology in the
luggage of the low paid foreign workers returning to India, Pakistan,
Indonesia, China, etc.  But, the CEOs got to save salary differential money
for their companies and enhance their stock option values and year-end
bonus packages for several years.  It is unfortunate for them (and this
country) that fewer U.S. students are seeking degrees in a field where they
will have to beat their heads against the corporate hiring wall trying to
get in.  Especially at a time when these companies have exported so much
expertise that the foreign tech workers are setting up rival companies in
their home country.  OOPS!... You can't apply 'just in time' materials
ordering techniques to your tech workers. There is a multi-year lead time.
And universities fund the different schools and departments based on
enrollment.  If students don't want to enter a field where it will be
difficult to find a job after graduation, then the college cuts that
departments funding and moves it to where the students ARE enrolling, such
as MBA programs.  This means the engineering and Computer Science schools
start to decline, lose good faculty, watch equipment become obsolete with
no funds for replacement, etc.  This, of course, makes the school even less
desirable for potential majors...  Somehow, these 'warnings' by CEOs sound
more like an excuse for moving their companies overseas, following the
workers they trained.

Economists Blast Bush Tax-Cut Proposal
 
WASHINGTON (Reuters, Feb 10, 2003) - Economists led by 10 Nobel laureates
on Monday attacked President Bush's $695 million tax-cut proposal, arguing
that the cuts fail to address the problems facing the U.S. economy and will
add to long-term budget deficits.
 
<snip>
 
"The tax plan proposed by President Bush is not the answer to these
problems. Regardless of how one views the specifics of the Bush plan, there
is wide agreement that its purpose is a permanent change in the tax
structure and not the creation of jobs and growth in the near term. The
permanent dividend tax cut, in particular, is not credible as a short-term
stimulus, said the statement, signed by more than 400 economists.

We should not march into Baghdad. . . .  To occupy Iraq would instantly
shatter our coalition, turning the whole Arab world against us, and make a
broken tyrant into a latter-day Arab hero . . . assigning young soldiers to
a fruitless hunt for a securely entrenched dictator and condemning them to
fight in what would be an unwinnable urban guerrilla war.  It could only
plunge that part of the world into even greater instability.

We call language a terrorist organization to illustrate the real effects of
language on citizens, especially in times of war.  Language, like
terrorism, targets civilians and generates fear in order to effect
political change.  When our political leaders and our media outlets use
terms like Anthrax, terrorist threat, madmen, and biological weapons, a
specific type of fearfulness emerges, both intentionally and
unintentionally.  We are all targets for this type of language, and we are
all affected by it as well.  Regardless of the truth of the words,
collateral language produces effects beyond its meaning.

I personally don't believe in a God of the type generally depicted by the
world's religions.  No white-haired, bearded father figure.  No 7-day
creation, mankind created in God's image, chosen peoples, or God-like
wrath.  Perhaps what many call God should simply be called Nature.
 
If there is a higher power, then I equate the moment of creation with the
Big Bang.  Everything since the Big Bang is therefore subject to study
without consideration of God's influence.  Man's greatest distinction from
the beasts of the land, sea, and air is his intellect, his ability to
reason and to choose rationally among competing explanations of events.
 
Each explanation, that an individual with free will chooses to endorse
above any other explanation, requires rational exercise of the intellect.
For one's belief system to be rational, one must make that belief system as
consistent and coherent as possible.
 
When I encounter a belief held by others, not shared by me, I examine it to
see if I can learn from it, and whether I should adopt it as my own.  If it
doesn't pass muster, I do not add it to my belief system.  If it *does*
pass muster, I struggle to overcome my prejudices and accept it.

Moral certainty is always a sign of cultural inferiority.  The more
uncivilized the man, the surer he is that he knows precisely what is right
and what is wrong.  All human progress, even in morals, has been the work
of men who have doubted the current moral values, not of men who have
whooped them up and tried to enforce them.  The truly civilized man is
always skeptical and tolerant, in this field as in all others.  His culture
is based on "I am not too sure."

The people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.  That is
easy.  All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and
denounce the peacemakers for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to
danger.  It works the same in any country.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS PRESIDENT:
I attacked and took over two countries.
I spent the U.S. surplus and bankrupted the Treasury. I shattered
the record for the biggest annual deficit in history. I set an
economic record for the most private bankruptcies filed in any 12
month period. I set all-time record for the biggest drop in the
history of the stock market.
 I am the first president in decades to execute a federal
prisoner. I am the first president in US history to enter office
with a criminal record.  I appointed more convicted criminals to
administration positions than any president in US history.
 In my first year in office I set the all-time record for most
days on vacation by any president in US history. After taking the
entire month of August off for vacation, I presided over the worst

security failure in US history.
 
 I set the record for most campaign fundraising trips by any
president in US history.
In my first two years in office over 2 million Americans lost
their job. I cut unemployment benefits for more out-of-work
Americans than any other president in US history. I set the all-
time record for most foreclosures in a 12-month period.
 I set the record for the fewest press conferences of any
president since the advent of TV.
I signed more laws and executive orders amending the Constitution
than any other US president in history
I presided over the biggest energy crises in US history and
refused to intervene when corruption was revealed. I presided over
the highest gasoline prices in US history and refused to use the
national reserves as past presidents have.
 I cut health care benefits for war veterans.
 I set the all-time record for most people worldwide to
simultaneously take to the streets to protest me (15 million
people), shattering the record for protest against any person in
the history of mankind.
 I dissolved more international treaties than any president in US
history. I've made my presidency the most secretive and
unaccountable of any in US history. Members of my cabinet are the
richest of any administration in US history. (The poorest
multimillionaire, Condoleeza Rice, has a Chevron oil tanker named
after her).
 I am the first president in US history to have all 50 states of
the Union simultaneously go bankrupt. I presided over the biggest
corporate stock market fraud in any market in any country in the
history of the world.
 
I am the first president in US history to order a US attack and
military occupation of a sovereign nation, and I did so against
the will of the United Nations and the world community.
I have created the largest government department bureaucracy in
the history of  the United States. I set the all-time record for
biggest annual budget spending increases, more than any other
president in US history. I am the first president in US history to
have the United Nations remove the US from the Human Rights
Commission. I am the first president in US history to have the
United Nations remove the US from the Elections Monitoring Board.
I removed more checks and balances, and have the least amount of
congressional oversight than any presidential administration in US
history. I rendered the entire United Nations irrelevant. I
withdrew from the World Court of Law. I refused to allow
inspectors access to US prisoners of war and by default no longer
abide by the Geneva Conventions. I am the first president in US
history to refuse United Nations election inspectors access during
the 2002 US elections. I am the all-time US (and world) record
holder for most corporate campaign donations. The biggest lifetime
contributor to my campaign, who is also one of my best friends,
presided over one of the largest corporate bankruptcy frauds in

world , history (Kenneth Lay, former CEO of Enron Corporation). I
spent more money on polls and focus groups than any president in
US history.
 
I am the first president to run and hide when the US came under
attack (and then lied, saying the enemy had the code to Air Force
1)
I am the first US president to establish a secret shadow
government. I took the world's sympathy for the US after 911, and
in less than a year made the US the most resented country in the
world (possibly the biggest diplomatic failure in US and world
history). I am the first US president in history to have a
majority of the people of Europe (71%) view my presidency as the
biggest threat to world peace and stability.
I am the first US president in history to have the people of South
Korea more threatened by the US than by their immediate neighbor,
North Korea. I changed US policy to allow convicted criminals to
be awarded government contracts. I set the all-time record for the
number of administration appointees who violated US law by not
selling their huge investments in corporations bidding for gov't
contracts. I have removed more freedoms and civil liberties for
Americans than any other president in US history.
In a little over two years I have created the most divided country
in decades, possibly the most divided that the US has been since
the civil war.
 
I entered office with the strongest economy in US history and in
less than two years turned every single economic category heading
straight down.

Today I begin to understand what love must be, if it exists.  When we are

incomplete like a book in two volumes of which the first has been lost.

Life is the acceptance of responsibilities or their evasion, it is a
business of meeting obligations or avoiding them.  To every man the choice
is continually being offered, and by the manner of his choosing you may
fairly measure him.

One is happy as a result of one's own efforts, once one knows the necessary
ingredients of happiness - simple tastes, a certain degree of courage,
self-denial to a point, love of work, and, above all, a clear conscience.
Happiness is no vague dream, of that I now feel certain.  By the proper use
of experience and thought one can draw much from oneself, by determination
and patience one can even restore one's health ... so let us live life as
it is, and not be ungrateful.

We've just gone through this huge dotcom-Internet-globalization bubble --
during which a lot of smart people got carried away and forgot the
fundamentals of how you build a profitable company, a lasting portfolio, a
nation-state, or a thriving student.  It turns out that the real secret of
success in the information age is what it always was: fundamentals --
reading, writing, and arithmetic; church, synagogue, and mosque; the rule
of law and good governance.  The Internet can make you smarter, but it
can't make you smart.  It can extend your reach, but it will never tell you
what to say at a PTA meeting.  These fundamentals cannot be downloaded.
You can only upload them, the old-fashioned way, one by one, in places like
[a] classroom.

I finally got a chance to look up "putting us on".
 
The earliest similar use seems to be from 1682, by Dryden:
        The first days the Duke supposed the illnes a little Put on.
 
But the first one with a person as object seems to be from 1958 and from
then-current slang:

putting him on a stage to be laughed at).  _American Speech_ XXXIII 225

When the security of this nation is threatened, Congress and the American
people give the president great latitude.  We probably have given this
president more flexibility, more latitude, more range, unquestioned, than
any president since Franklin Roosevelt--probably too much.  The Congress,
in my opinion, really abrogated much of its responsibility.

Whenever you're called on to make up your mind,

the best way to solve the dilemma, you'll find,
    is simply by spinning a penny.
 
No - not so that chance shall decide the affair
    while you're passively standing there moping;
but the moment the penny is up in the air,
    you suddenly know what you're hoping.

In science it often happens that scientists say, "You know that's a really
good argument; my position is mistaken," and then they would actually
change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again.  They
really do it.  It doesn't happen as often as it should, because scientists
are human and change is sometimes painful.  But it happens every day.  I
cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or
religion.

If you are doing something you do not enjoy, such as a certain type of work
because you need the money for school, your family, or whatever, and find
yourself complaining and feeling hard done by, then you are enduring a life
of conflict.  You either have to change your thinking or your job.  When
you choose to do something for a certain benefit such as money, complaining
while you are doing it is, of course, a waste of energy and time and is
self-destructive.

I believe that all emotions are allowed, disallowed or redirected into
other emotions by one's own choices.  There may be cultural or moral
influences that affect how a person manages his or her emotions, yet I
believe choice is more powerful than such mores.  A person who hates
America has chosen to accept that emotion toward that country.  Every
rationalization meant to justify that hate for America will fail to explain
it, though many people may agree with the rationalization.  In the end, an
individual has judged that particular emotion as desirable or necessary and
he chooses to allow it to mature.  Since emotions affect our being in
negative or positive ways, a person who chooses to allows himself to be
overcome with negative emotions has in effect chosen to harm himself.  That
is not a rational choice.  When societies accept such harmful choices
(emotions) as valid or necessary, the end results are jihad, crusades, war,
death, and general harm to other human beings.

being served.  The man who speaks to you of sacrifice speaks of slaves and
masters.  And intends to be master.

No party holds the privilege of dictating to me how I shall vote. If
loyalty to party is a form of patriotism, I am no patriot. If there is any
valuable difference between a monarchist and an American, it lies in the
theory that the American can decide for himself what is patriotic and what
isn't. I claim that difference. I am the only person in the sixty millions
that is privileged to dictate my patriotism.

did not blindly rally behind it by furnishing the exorbitant sums demanded.
Yet, in retrospect, these disasters seem never to have happened, seem never

The peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is
robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those
who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it.  If the
opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error
for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the
clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its
collision with error.

The age of the computer and of television has fundamentally altered the way
in which the modern political candidate perceives his role.  The great
statesmen of the past saw themselves as heroes who took on the burden of
their societies' painful journey from the familiar to the as yet unknown.
The modern politician is less interested in being a hero than a superstar.
Heroes walk alone; stars derive their status from approbation.  Heroes are
defined by inner values, stars by consensus.  When a candidate's views are
forged in focus groups and ratified by television anchorpersons, insecurity
and superficiality become congenital.  Radicalism replaces liberalism, and
populism masquerades as conservatism.
 
A curious blend of brittleness and flamboyance thus defines the modern
political persona: brittleness verging on obsequiousness in the quest for
mass approval, flamboyance turning into panic when the public's mood
shifts.  Far more concerned with what to say than with what to think, the
modern political leader too frequently fails to fulfill the role for which
he is needed most: to provide the emotional ballast when experience is
being challenged by ever-accelerating change.  The inability to fulfill
these emotional needs lies behind the curious paradox of contemporary
democracy: never have political leaders been more abject in trying to
determine the public's preferences, yet, in most democracies, respect for
the political class has never been lower.

Both the assembling and the distribution of knowledge in the world at
present are extremely ineffective, and thinkers of the forward-looking type
whose ideas we are now considering, are beginning to realize that the most
hopeful line for the development of our racial intelligence lies rather in
the direction of creating a new world organ for the collection, indexing,
summarizing and release of knowledge, than in any further tinkering with
the highly conservative and resistant university system, local, national,
and traditional in texture, which already exists.

Whatever the future of self-government in Baghdad, the Bush administration
has inadvertently created a domestic mind-set that might be called the
"Iraqi Syndrome."
 
Any future attempt by Bush or another president to wage war in the absence
of a direct attack is likely to trigger a chorus of angry opposition.
Critics will inevitably cite the missing Iraqi weapons of mass destruction,
the woeful intelligence failures and the unduly optimistic scenarios that
accompanied the occupation.  Just as memories of the Vietnam quagmire once
hobbled American foreign policy, now presidents will have to grapple with
the images from the Iraqi sandstorm.
 
The overthrow of Saddam was probably not the war to end all American wars.
But because of the creation of the Iraq Syndrome, it may be the last

rubber ball.  If you drop it, it will bounce back.  But the other four
balls - family, health, friends and spirit are made of glass.  If you drop
one of these, they will be irrevocably scuffed, marked, nicked, damaged, or
even shattered.  They will never be the same.  You must understand that and
strive for balance in your life.

drain your mind of all thought.  And there you are watching the bubbles in
the primeval ooze.  You don't have to concentrate.  You don't have to
react.  You don't have to remember.  You don't miss your brain because you
don't need it.  Your heart and liver and lungs continue to function
normally.  Apart from that, all is peace and quiet.  You are in the man's

look like a fly on a can of garbage, pay him no mind.  He probably hasn't

An obsession with polite or correct public language is a sign that
communication is in decline.  It means that the process and exercise of
power have replaced debate as a public value.  The citizen's job is to be
rude -- to pierce the comfort of professional intercourse by boorish
expressions of doubt.  Politics, philosophy, writing, the arts -- none of
these, and certainly not science and economics, can serve the common weal
if they are swathed in politeness.  In everything which affects public
affairs, breeding is for fools.

The notion of political correctness has ignited controversy across the
land.  And although the movement arises from the laudable desire to sweep
away the debris of racism and sexism and hatred, it replaces old prejudices
with new ones.  It declares certain topics off-limits, certain expressions
off-limits, even certain gestures off-limits.  What began as a crusade for
civility has soured into a cause of conflict and even censorship.

3 Banks Robbed During Bush, Kerry Visit
By MICHELLE SPITZER, Associated Press Writer
 
DAVENPORT, Iowa - Three banks were robbed while President Bush and
Democratic nominee John Kerry were speaking just blocks away from one
another Wednesday morning.
 
The Ralston Credit Union was robbed at 10:45 a.m., shortly after the
president began speaking at LeClaire Park in this eastern Iowa town, said
Davenport police Capt. David Struckman.
 
The next robbery, at First National Bank, happened at 11:23 a.m., followed
by another at 11:45 a.m. at Southeast National Bank, said Struckman, who
also served as the department's liaison to the U.S. Secret Service during
the visits from the two political leaders.

Every generation must resist the temptation to believe that it lives in the
most dangerous time in American history.  The threat of Islamic terrorism
is real, but it is not the greatest danger ever faced by our nation.  This
is not to dismiss the threat of terrorism, but rather to put it in
perspective.  Those who seek to whip the nation into a frenzy of fear do a
disservice to a country that expelled the British, fought two world wars,
and stared down the Soviet empire.

The United States should not commit its forces to military action overseas
unless the cause is vital to our national interest.  If the decision is
made to commit its forces to combat abroad, it must be done with clear
intent and support to win.  There must be clearly defined and realistic
objectives.  There must be reasonable assurance that the cause we are
fighting for will have the support of the American people and Congress.
Our troops should be committed to combat abroad only as a last resort, when
no other choice is available.

Please be advised that the prospectus for the offering of Google's Class A
common stock will be amended to change the estimated offering price range
and the number of shares to be sold in the offering. The offering price is
now expected to be between $85 and $95 per share. Google expects to sell
14,142,135 shares of Class A common stock in the offering as originally
filed. The selling shareholders are reducing the shares they expect to sell
to approximately 5.5 million shares in view of this new price range. This
is a reduction of approximately 6.1 million shares. In addition, the
selling shareholders have granted the underwriters the right to purchase
approximately 2.9 million additional shares of Class A common stock at the
initial public offering price to cover over-allotments.

Reason is a biological product -- a tool whose power is inherently and
substantially restricted.  It has improved how we do things; it has not
changed why we do things.  Reason has generated knowledge enabling us to
fly around the world in less than two days.  Yet we still travel for the
same purposes that drove our ancient ancestors -- commerce, conquest,
religion, romance, curiosity, or escape from overcrowding, poverty, and
persecution.
 
To deny that reason has a role in setting our goals seems, at first, rather
odd.  A personal decision to go on a diet or take more exercise appears to
be based upon reason.  The same might be said for a government decision to
raise taxes or sign a trade treaty.  But reason is only contributing to the
"how" portion of these decisions; the more fundamental "why" element, for
all of these examples, is driven by instinctive self-preservation,
emotional needs, and cultural attitudes.  We are usually reluctant to admit
the extent to which these forces govern our behavior, and accordingly we
often recruit reason to explain and justify our actions.

To think of the future and wait was merely another way of saying one was a
coward; any idea of moderation was just another attempt to disguise one's
unmanly character; ability to understand the question from all sides meant
that one was totally unfitted for action; fanatical enthusiasm was the mark
of a real man...  Anyone who held violent opinions could always be trusted,
and anyone who objected to them became a suspect.

As both capitalist and communist states -- not to mention the technological
world -- have evolved under the illusion that men purposefully built them,
ideological optimism seeps into every niche of our lives.  It is made worse
by mass culture which feeds our most destructive illusions, fostering the
belief that if we're only justified (and who isn't?), if we only calculate
things correctly, if we only do the right thing (and who doesn't?), then
the future must yield the desired results.  There must always be a way.
And so hubris turns to false certainties, everyone expects to be a winner,
and each morning is a mind-blowing surprise.

Even if Hussein were captured and his regime toppled, U.S. forces would
still have been confronted with the specter of a military occupation of
indefinite duration to pacify the country and sustain a new government in
power.
 
Removing him from power might well have plunged Iraq into civil war,
sucking U.S. forces in to preserve order.  Had we elected to march on
Baghdad, our forces might still be there.
 
[Ousting Saddam militarily] would certainly have resulted in substantially
greater casualties to American forces than (Desert Storm) itself.  For this
reason, our military and the president's senior advisers were properly
dead-set against it.

An Open Letter to the American Public
 
... President Bush believes that tax cuts benefiting the most-wealthy
Americans are the answer to almost every economic problem. ...  President
Bush's fiscal irresponsibility threatens the long-term economic security
and prosperity of our nation.  At a time when our nation should be saving
for the future, to pay the Medicare and Social Security benefits for the
baby boomers, our national debt is swelling; the social contract that binds
one generation to another is being threatened with unraveling. ...  At the
same time, his policies have exacerbated income inequality, failed to
address the real wage declines and rising health care costs beleaguering
American families, and ignored the need for critical investments to spur
long-term growth.

I think we're tired -- collectively -- we've been worn down by fear, by
grief.  Our country was attacked, and we keep being warned of more attacks.
We see all this anger churning around us, and we feel helpless to stop it.
I think most of us long for civilized discourse, an easy exchange of
opinions; we're just too tired to dig in and insist upon it.  How are we
going to explain to future generations that our freedom to express
ourselves without impunity got lost along the way because we didn't have
the energy to defend it?
 
I had one moment of hope recently.  When I went to Barnes & Noble to
replace my worn copy of "1984," the book was sold out.  It's required
reading for students, and there had been a run on Orwell's novel.  Maybe a
new generation of readers will be so frightened by the book that they'll
work harder to make sure it doesn't become a reality.

I would guess if we had gone in there (in 1991), I would still have forces
in Baghdad today.  We'd be running the country.  We would not have been
able to get everybody out and bring everybody home.
 
And the final point that I think needs to be made is this question of
casualties.  I don't think you could have done all of that without
significant additional U.S. casualties.  And while everybody was
tremendously impressed with the low cost of the (1991) conflict, for the
146 Americans who were killed in action and for their families, it wasn't a
cheap war.
 
And the question in my mind is how many additional American casualties is
Saddam (Hussein) worth?  And the answer is not that damned many.  So, I
think we got it right, both when we decided to expel him from Kuwait, but
also when the president made the decision that we'd achieved our objectives
and we were not going to go get bogged down in the problems of trying to
take over and govern Iraq.

people may entrust all their power to anyone, and the power of the

since it came originally from the sovereign people.

from an appearance Wednesday where he will receive an award for supporting
free speech.

The City Club usually tapes speakers for later broadcast on public
television, but Scalia insisted on banning television and radio coverage,
the club said. Scalia is being given the organization's Citadel of Free
Speech Award.
 
"I might wish it were otherwise, but that was one of the criteria that he
had for acceptance," said James Foster, the club's executive director.

Our progress in degeneracy appears to me to be pretty rapid.  As a nation,
we begin by declaring that "all men are created equal." We now practically
read it "all men are created equal, except negroes." When the Know-Nothings
get control, it will read "all men are created equal, except negroes, and
foreigners, and catholics." When it comes to this I should prefer
emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty --
to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the
base alloy of hypocracy (sic).

Said a blade of grass to an autumn leaf, "You make such a noise falling!
You scatter all my winter dreams."
 
Said the leaf indignant, "Low-born and low-dwelling! Songless, peevish
thing! You live not in the upper air and you cannot tell the sound of
singing."
 
Then the autumn leaf lay down upon the earth and slept. And when spring
came she waked again -- and she was a blade of grass.
 
And when it was autumn and her winter sleep was upon her, and above her
through all the air the leaves were falling, she muttered to herself, "O
these autumn leaves! They make such a noise! They scatter all my winter
dreams."

Americans, unhappily, have the most remarkable ability to alchemize all
bitter truths into an innocuous but piquant confection and to transform
their moral contradictions, or public discussion of such contradictions,
into a proud decoration, such as are given for heroism on the battle field.

Single again, single again, jiggety jig.  
 
After 14 years of being happily married (16 total), I've separated from my
(for 2 years, alcoholic, adulterous) wife.  She, of course, immediately
moved in with her abusive boyfriend, who still lives with his mother, and
who is awaiting trial for domestic battery against my wife.  I guess the
no-contact order (as a condition of his bond) doesn't phase either of them.
Oh, and he's still married to the woman he has prior convictions of
domestically battering.
 
I swear, I couldn't make this shit up.

To say that we are closer to victory today is to believe, in the face of
evidence, the optimists who have been wrong in the past. To suggest we are
on the edge of defeat is to yield to unreasonable pessimism. To say that we
are mired in stalemate seems the only realistic, yet unsatisfactory,
conclusion.

    Today, I also speak anew to my fellow citizens:
    From all of you I have asked patience in the hard task of securing
America, which you have granted in good measure. Our country has accepted
obligations that are difficult to fulfill, and would be dishonorable to
abandon.
                                George W Bush - Jan. 20 2005
 
Man is really the most interesting jackass there is ....
 
Man is the only patriot. He sets himself apart in his own country, under
his own flag, and sneers at the other nations. Keeps uniformed assasins on
hand at heavy expense to grab slices of other people's countries and keep
them from grabbing slices of his, with the result that there's not an acre
of ground on the globe that's in the possession of its rightful owner. And
in the intrevals between campaigns, he washes the blood from his hands and
works for the brotherhood of man -- with his mouth.
 
Man is the only animal that deals in the atrocity of war. He's the only one
that, for assorted wages, goes forth in cold blood to exterminate his own
kind. He has a motto for this: "Our country right or wrong! Any man who
fails to shout it is a traitor; only the others are patriots."
 
Say, who is the country? Is it the government? In a republic, the
government is merely a servant - a temporary one. Its function is to obey
orders, not originate them. Only when the republic's life is in danger
should a man uphold his government when it's wrong. Otherwise, the nation
has sold its honor for a phrase.
 
If that phrase needs help, he gets another one. "Even though the war be
wrong, we are in it. We must fight it out. We cannot retire without
dishonor." Why, not even a burglar could have said it better.

fireplace.  Or it can be misplaced in proportion, like an excess of love
can make us overly sentimental, or a lack of love can make us cruel and
destructive.  It is in things such as these that evil lies, not in a
personal Devil who acts as an Adversary.

miles an hour, destroying the car and causing a few thousand dollars in
damage to the garage.  When my wife objects, I say: "I have to infer from

up the wall."

have to fork out ten thousand dollars to fix the garage."

A popular epithet directed by some members of society, including some
members of Congress, toward the judiciary involves the denunciation of
"activist judges"  Generally, the definition of an "activist judge" is one
who decides the outcome of a controversy before him according to personal
conviction, even one sincerely held, as opposed to the dictates of the law
as constrained by legal precent and, ultimately, our Constitution. In
resolving the Schiavo controvery it is my judgement that, despite sincere
and altruistic motivation, the legislative and executive branches of our
government have acted in a manner demonstrably at odds with our Founding
Fathers' blueprint for the goernance of a free people -- our Constitution.

For the last few years we have been ruled by lexicographers.  Never has an
administration spent so much time creating, defining, or redefining terms,
perhaps because no one (since George Orwell) has grasped the power and
possibility that lay hidden in plain sight in the naming and renaming of
words.  In a sense, our post-9/11 moment began with two definitions: The
Bush administration named our global enemy "terrorism" and called the acts
that followed a "war," which was soon given the moniker "the global war on
terror", which was then given an instant future -- being defined as a
"generational struggle" that was still to come.  All this, along with "war"
itself, was simply announced rather than officially "declared."
 
Given that we were (by administration definition) at war, it should have
been self-evident that those we captured in our "war" on terrorism would
then be "prisoners of war," but no such luck for them, since their rights

would in that case have been clearly defined in international treaties
signed by the United States.  So the Bush administration opened its Devil's
Dictionary and came up with a new, tortured term for our new prisoners,
"unlawful combatants," which really stood for: We can do anything we want
to you in a place of our choosing.  For that place, they then chose
Guantnamo, an American base in Cuba (which they promptly defined as within
"Cuban sovereignty" for the purposes of putting our detention camps beyond
the purview of American courts or Congress, but within Bush administration
sovereignty -- the sole kind that counted with them -- for the purposes of
the Cubans).
 
In this way, we moved from a self-declared generational war against a
method of making war to a world of torture beyond the reach of, or even
sight of, the law in a place that (until the Supreme Court recently ruled
otherwise) more or less didn't exist.  All this was then supported by a
world of pretzeled language constantly being reshaped in the White House
Counsel's office, the Justice Department, and the Pentagon so that reality
would have no choice but to comply with the names given it.

It comes down to the value of examples, which can be either positive or
negative, and it works like this: Because of the principle that a calm sea
and prosperous voyage do not make news but a shipwreck does, most
circulated news is bad news.  The badness of it is publicized, and the
negative publicity attracts more of the same through repetition and
imitation.
 
But good can be as communicable as evil, and that is where kindness and
compassion come into play.  So long as conscionable and caring people are
around, so long as they are not muted or exiled, so long as they remain
alert in thought and action, there is a chance for contagions of the right
stuff.

It is this system, consistently applied, which protects the governed from
those who govern and defends the weak against the strong.  It is the shield
of the poor against the advantages of wealth and the armor of the average
citizen against the aggressions of the powerful.  No person is so big that
he is above the law, and none so insignificant that he cannot look to it
for protection.
 
It is this system, rule by law, that enables each of us to go about his
daily business, enter into agreements with others, establish homes, raise
families, and plan for the future, secure in the knowledge that the
business and the property which were his this morning will be his tonight,
and that the legal rights and duties which governed his decisions today
will be unchanged tomorrow.  It is this principle, when applied to
international affairs, which offers the brightest hope for world peace.

IRAQ: PRIME MINISTER'S MEETING, 23 JULY, 2002
 
Copy addressees and you met the Prime Minister on 23 July to discuss Iraq.
 
This record is extremely sensitive. No further copies should be made. It
should be shown only to those with a genuine need to know its contents.
 
...
 
C reported on his recent talks in Washington. There was a perceptible shift
in attitude. Military action was now seen as inevitable. Bush wanted to
remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of
terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around
the policy. The NSC had no patience with the UN route, and no enthusiasm
for publishing material on the Iraqi regime's record. There was little
discussion in Washington of the aftermath after military action.
 
...
 
The Defence Secretary said that the US had already begun "spikes of
activity" to put pressure on the regime. No decisions had been taken, but
he thought the most likely timing in US minds for military action to begin
was January, with the timeline beginning 30 days before the US
Congressional elections.
 
The Foreign Secretary said he would discuss this with Colin Powell this
week. It seemed clear that Bush had made up his mind to take military
action, even if the timing was not yet decided. But the case was thin.
Saddam was not threatening his neighbours, and his WMD capability was less
than that of Libya, North Korea or Iran. We should work up a plan for an
ultimatum to Saddam to allow back in the UN weapons inspectors. This would
also help with the legal justification for the use of force.
 
The Attorney-General said that the desire for regime change was not a legal
base for military action. There were three possible legal bases:
self-defence, humanitarian intervention, or UNSC authorisation. The first
and second could not be the base in this case. Relying on UNSCR 1205 of

The Prime Minister said that it would make a big difference politically and
legally if Saddam refused to allow in the UN inspectors. Regime change and
WMD were linked in the sense that it was the regime that was producing the
WMD.

The Defence Secretary said that if the Prime Minister wanted UK military
involvement, he would need to decide this early. He cautioned that many in
the US did not think it worth going down the ultimatum route. It would be
important for the Prime Minister to set out the political context to Bush.

The young are voracious consumers of media, but not of journalism.
Sixty-eight percent of children 8 to 18 have televisions in their rooms; 33
percent have computers.  And if they could have only one entertainment
medium, a third would choose the computer, a quarter would choose
television.  They carry their media around with them: 79 percent of young
people ages 8 to 18 have portable CD, tape or MP3 players.  Fifty-five
percent have hand-held video game players.  Sony's PlayStation Portable,
which plays music, games and movies, sold more than 500,000 units in the
first two days after its March debut.

Nobody can understand how all technology works.  But it always surprises me
how so many people can go through life in delightful ignorance, not only
unaware of why their car moves forward or there is sound in the radio, but
not even being curious about it.  It is not hard to find out how things
work.  Gone are the days of wiring diagrams and complex mathematical
formulae.  You can find excellent explanations, helpful graphics and
animation schemes describing how many common technologies work.
 
But no.  People want to press a button and just have it done.  And therein
lies the problem.  If you don't know how things work, you don't know what
is hard.  So you invest in natural language systems (speech recognition has
been a promising technology for 30 years) or systems that can predict the
stock market.  Or you go out and spend a fortune on pyramid schemes or
magnet therapy.  And wander through life, "mouth agape in doltish wonder,"
to quote Paul Fussell.

I must not fear.  Fear is the mind-killer.  Fear is the little-death that
brings total obliteration.  I will face my fear.  I will permit it to pass
over me and through me.  And when it has gone past I will turn the inner
eye to see its path.  Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.  Only
I will remain.

Congratulations to my big fat black cat Dude for attaining the age of 17
years as of 7/9/2005.  The oldest cat I've ever owned, and still going
strong.
 
He was born behind the couch in the apartment I shared with then-girlfriend
(now ex-wife) Melody in Lakeside, CA, in 1988 on the same day that I flew
to Illinois to check on job prospects that soon led to my return to
Illinois from a 3-year stint in San Diego.
 
His father was my cat, "Tranch" (short for Tarantula, a name given by a
friend who was amused by the long white hairs that stood out through his
otherwise smooth black coat); his mother was Melody's cat Gizmo (who
earlier survived a near-fatal encounter with a car, and had pins in her
leg).  On that same morning, my female cat Jasper & Melody's male cat JYC
(Junkyard Cat) had a litter under the dishwasher that included Misty, who
passed away in February of '04.

Dude & Misty were the 2 kittens that we brought with us from California
when we moved.  He's older than 3 of my kids (one of whom has her driver's
license), and remains the alpha male in a 5-cat household.

suggests wild carelessness and disregard for consequences: conceiving
measures to protect the fur-bearing animals from reckless slaughter
(Getrude Atherton). Rash implies haste, impetuousness, and insufficient
consideration: Take calculated risks. That is quite different from being
rash (George S. Patton). Precipitate connotes headlong haste without due
deliberation: destroyed in a precipitate burning of his papers a few days
before his death (James Boswell). Foolhardy implies injudicious or
imprudent boldness: a foolhardy attempt to wrest the gun from the mugger.
Temerarious suggests reckless presumption: this temerarious foeman who
dared intervene between himself [the elephant] and his intended victim
(Edgar Rice Burroughs).

For the most part, those who are labeled liberals want to leave most
decisions up to the individual and want laws that protect those individual
rights.  The (ultra-right) conservatives, in the name of increasing state
power over federal power are actually interested in making sure that all
individuals must abide by the conduct that they (the ultra-right
conservatives) believe is proper.  They know that they will have more luck
getting states to enact laws that will support this, so they work to put
the power in the hands of the state.
 
People who want to take away my power to make decisions about things that
don't even impact them in a direct (or indirect) way simply because they
wouldn't make the same decision for themselves, or perhaps because they are
scared that they would and so they want the power taken out of their hands,
scare me.

We as a society need to pull up the assumption that those who aren't doing
well are in that situation because they're not willing to work hard enough,
examine it, recognize how wrong it is, and decide what to do for the people
who don't have the combination of skills and natural aptitude to be able to
earn enough money to support themselves.  We pride America on being a place
where anyone can succeed, but even in the ideal America, all that that
means is that anyone who has the right combination of drive, talent, and

luck can succeed.  In fact, anyone who has enough drive, talent, and luck
does succeed, though some people are given privileged positions to start
from.  Amazingly few people choose to fail; nearly all of the people who
end up not as well off as they imagined ended up that way in spite of their
best efforts.  They may not have worked as hard as some others, but almost
everyone works hard by their own standards.  The ones who don't are those
who have despaired of finding work where the level and quality of effort
that they are capable of will be appreciated.  In particular, anyone who is
not capable for reasons of physical or mental health of working 40 hours a
week every week, with overtime at the boss' whim, with two weeks' vacation
a year if they're lucky, is screwed unless they have have highly valuable
skills.  They may be able to get some work, but it won't pay well, it won't
have health benefits, and it will probably suck out their soul.

Intelligent Design: Why limit equal time to biology class?
Salt Lake Tribune 8/05/2005
 
President Bush has thrown in with those who think that an idea called
"intelligent design" should be taught alongside evolution in the nation's
schools.
 
"I think that part of education is to expose people to different schools of
thought," the president told some visiting newspaper reporters from his
native Texas.
 
OK. But why stop there?
 
While the science teacher is at it, he might make the study of astronomy
more poetic by including the theory that the sun is not a frighteningly
impersonal thermonuclear furnace but actually the flaming chariot of
Phoebus Apollo streaking across the sky.
 
Or he might calm the students' fears of being adrift in a soulless universe

by casting aside all this Copernican nonsense and admitting that, as any
fool can see just by looking up, the Earth stands still and the sun, moon
and stars revolve around us, er, it.
 
History? Make sure all those open-minded students hear that we never landed
on the moon, President Kennedy was killed by the CIA and the Nazis couldn't
possibly have killed 6 million Jews.
 
Seriously, are all those alternative ideas to be banned from the public
consciousness? Of course not. They might even be discussed in school, if
there's time.
 
But given the limited time and resources of our schools, and the sometimes
minuscule attention span of our students, we need to make sure we don't
lose our focus.
 
In science class, focus on established science.

science [Lat. scientia=knowledge]. For many the term science refers to the
organized body of knowledge concerning the physical world, both animate and
inanimate, but a proper definition would also have to include the attitudes
and methods through which this body of knowledge is formed; thus, a science
is both a particular kind of activity and also the results of that
activity.
 
The Scientific Method
The scientific method has evolved over many centuries and has now come to
be described in terms of a well-recognized and well-defined series of
steps.  First, information, or data, is gathered by careful observation of
the phenomenon being studied.  On the basis of that information a
preliminary generalization, or hypothesis, is formed, usually by inductive
reasoning, and this in turn leads by deductive logic to a number of
implications that may be tested by further observations and experiments
(see induction; deduction).  If the conclusions drawn from the original
hypothesis successfully meet all these tests, the hypothesis becomes
accepted as a scientific theory or law; if additional facts are in
disagreement with the hypothesis, it may be modified or discarded in favor
of a new hypothesis, which is then subjected to further tests.  Even an
accepted theory may eventually be overthrown if enough contradictory
evidence is found, as in the case of Newtonian mechanics, which was shown
after more than two centuries of acceptance to be an approximation valid
only for speeds much less than that of light.
 
Role of Measurement and Experiment

All of the activities of the scientific method are characterized by a
scientific attitude, which stresses rational impartiality.  Measurement
plays an important role, and when possible the scientist attempts to test
his theories by carefully designed and controlled experiments that will
yield quantitative rather than qualitative results.  Theory and experiment
work together in science, with experiments leading to new theories that in
turn suggest further experiments.  Although these methods and attitudes are
generally shared by scientists, they do not provide a guaranteed means of
scientific discovery; other factors, such as intuition, experience, good
judgment, and sometimes luck, also contribute to new developments in
science.

General Casey, the U.S. commander in Iraq, will announce at an opportune
moment before the November 2006 U.S. elections that "Iraqization" has
reached a point where he can begin the troop withdrawals he previewed with
Secretary Rumsfeld in Baghdad on July 27.  The conservative media
conglomerates on which ordinary Americans depend for news will judge Iraq's
civil war no longer newsworthy, since US troops are officially not
involved.  When the carnage becomes too gruesome to ignore, the President
will explain that it was the Iraqi politicians, not America's brave
soldiers, who had failed.  The American people will believe because Bush
himself will believe.

If this claim is true, with its clear implication that the Iranian
government is supporting Iraqi insurgents, can someone tell me why the
Iranians would support a largely Sunni Iraqi insurgency against an allied,
mainly Shiite government?

Energy will be one of the defining issues of this century.  One thing is
clear: the era of easy oil is over.  What we all do next will determine how
well we meet the energy needs of the entire world in this century and
beyond.
 
Demand is soaring like never before.  As populations grow and economies
take off, millions in the developing world are enjoying the benefits of a
lifestyle that requires increasing amounts of energy.  In fact, some say
that in 20 years the world will consume 40% more oil than it does today.
At the same time, many of the world's oil and gas fields are maturing.  And
new energy discoveries are mainly occurring in places where resources are
difficult to extract, physically, economically and even politically.  When
growing demand meets tighter supplies, the result is more competition for
the same resources.
 
We can wait until a crisis forces us to do something.  Or we can commit to
working together ...  Whatever actions we take, we must look not just to
next year, but to the next 50 years.

Direct hit in New Orleans could mean a modern Atlantis
 
More than 1.2 million people in metropolitan New Orleans were warned to get
out Tuesday as [the] 140-mph hurricane churned toward the Gulf Coast,
threatening to submerge this below-sea-level city in what could be the most
disastrous storm to hit in nearly 40 years.

The evacuation of New Orleans in the face of [the] hurricane ... looked

mainly Black -- were left behind in their below-sea-level shotgun shacks
and aging tenements to face the watery wrath.

US FORCED TO IMPORT BULLETS FROM ISRAEL AS TROOPS USE 250,000 FOR EVERY
REBEL KILLED - Andrew Buncombe (Independent, September 25, 2005)
 
US forces have fired so many bullets in Iraq and Afghanistan -- an
estimated 250,000 for every insurgent killed -- that American
ammunition-makers cannot keep up with demand. As a result the US is having
to import supplies from Israel.

 Don't want a nation under the new media.
 And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
 The subliminal mindfuck America.

 All across the alien nation. 
 Everything isn't meant to be okay.
 Television dreams of tomorrow.
 We're not the ones who're meant to follow.

Well maybe I'm the faggot America.
 I'm not a part of a redneck agenda.
 Now everybody do the propaganda.
 And sing along in the age of paranoia.

Onward, moderate Christian soldiers
John C. Danforth, The New York Times
WEDNESDAY, JUNE 22, 2005
 
ST. LOUIS, Missouri It would be an oversimplification to say that America's
culture wars are now between people of faith and nonbelievers. People of
faith are not of one mind, whether on specific issues like stem cell
research and government intervention in the case of Terri Schiavo, or the
more general issue of how religion relates to politics.
 
In recent years, conservative Christians have presented themselves as
representing the one authentic Christian perspective on politics. With due
respect for our conservative friends, equally devout Christians come to
very different conclusions.
 
It is important for those of us who are sometimes called moderates to make
the case that we, too, have strongly held Christian convictions, that we
speak from the depths of our beliefs, and that our approach to politics is
at least as faithful as that of those who are more conservative. Our
difference concerns the extent to which government should, or even can,
translate religious beliefs into the laws of the state.
 
People of faith have the right, and perhaps the obligation, to bring their
values to bear in politics. Many conservative Christians approach politics
with a certainty that they know God's truth, and that they can advance the
kingdom of God through governmental action. So they have developed a
political agenda to do so.
 
Moderate Christians are less certain about when and how our beliefs can be
translated into statutory form, not because of a lack of faith in God but
because of a healthy acknowledgment of the limitations of human beings.
Like conservative Christians, we attend church, read the Bible and say our
prayers.
 
But for us, the only absolute standard of behavior is the commandment to
love our neighbors as ourselves. Repeatedly in the Gospels, we find that
the Love Commandment takes precedence when it conflicts with laws. We
struggle to follow that commandment as we face the realities of everyday
living, and we do not agree that our responsibility to live as Christians
can be codified by legislators.
 
When, on television, we see a person in a persistent vegetative state, one
who will never recover, we believe that allowing the natural and merciful
end to her ordeal is more loving than imposing government power to keep her
hooked up to a feeding tube.
 
When we see an opportunity to save our neighbors' lives through stem cell

research, we believe that it is our duty to pursue that research, and to
oppose legislation that would impede us from doing so.
 
We think that efforts to haul references of God into the public square,
into schools and courthouses, are far more apt to divide Americans than to
advance faith.
 
Following a Lord who reached out in compassion to all human beings, we
oppose amending the Constitution in a way that would humiliate homosexuals.
 
For us, living the Love Commandment may be at odds with efforts to
encapsulate Christianity in a political agenda. We strongly support the
separation of church and state, both because that principle is essential to
holding together a diverse country, and because the policies of the state
always fall short of the demands of faith. Aware that even our most
passionate ventures into politics are efforts to carry the treasure of
religion in the earthen vessel of government, we proceed in a spirit of
humility lacking in our conservative colleagues.
 
In the decade since I left the Senate, American politics has been
characterized by two phenomena: the increased activism of the Christian
right, especially in the Republican Party, and the collapse of bipartisan
collegiality. I do not think it is a stretch to suggest a relationship
between the two.
 
To assert that I am on God's side and you are not, that only I know God's
will, and that I will use the power of government to advance my
understanding of God's kingdom is certain to produce hostility. By
contrast, moderate Christians see ourselves, literally, as moderators. Far
from claiming to possess God's truth, we claim only to be imperfect seekers
of the truth.
 
We reject the notion that religion should present a series of wedge issues
useful at election time for energizing a political base. We believe it is
God's work to practice humility, to wear tolerance on our sleeves, to reach
out to those with whom we disagree, and to overcome the meanness we see in
today's politics.
 
Christians who hold these convictions ought to add their clear voice of
moderation to the debate on religion in politics.

We seem to have a compulsion these days to bury time capsules in order to
give those people living in the next century or so some idea of what we are
like.  I have prepared one of my own.  I have placed some rather large
samples of dynamite, gunpowder, and nitroglycerin.  My time capsule is set
to go off in the year 3000.  It will show them what we are really like.

In general people experience their present naively, as it were, without
being able to form an estimate of its contents; they have first to put
themselves at a distance from it -- the present, that is to say, must have
become the past -- before it can yield points of vantage from which to
judge the future.

Space Shuttle Mission 51-L lifted off from Pad B at Cape Canaveral at 11:38
am Eastern, twenty years ago tomorrow, January 28, 1986.  It was the 25th
Shuttle launch, the 10th for Challenger (OV-099).  Challenger had made 987
orbits of the earth and spent 69 days in space in her first nine flights.
On board were Francis R.  Scobee, Michael J. Smith, Judith A. Resnik,
Ellison S. Onizuka, Ronald E. McNair, Gregory B. Jarvis, and Sharon Christa
McAuliffe.  The mission ended in a fireball 46,000 feet above the Atlantic,
73 seconds into the flight.
 
I didn't hear what had happened for several hours, though I did notice
while on a bike ride that day climbing Lake Jennings Park Road outside
Lakeside, CA that flags were flying at half staff at the county facility at
the side of the road.  I didn't own a TV, so at about 6pm I listened to NPR
and heard the news.  I knocked on my neighbor's door and asked to watch the
6 o'clock news with them where I saw the video for the first time.

Mankind have a great aversion to intellectual labor; but even supposing
knowledge to be easily attainable, more people would be content to be
ignorant than would take even a little trouble to acquire it.

U.S. Army, and a founding member of Delta Force, the military's elite
covert counter-terrorist unit.
 
Q: What's your assessment of the war in Iraq?
 
A: Utter debacle.  But it had to be from the very first.  The reasons were
wrong.  The reasons of this administration for taking this nation to war
were not what they stated.  (Army Gen.) Tommy Franks was brow-beaten and
... pursued warfare that he knew strategically was wrong in the long term.
That's why he retired immediately afterward.  His own staff could tell him
what was going to happen afterward.
 
Q: What is the cost to our country?
 
A: For the first thing, our credibility is utterly zero.  So we destroyed
whatever credibility we had. ... And I say "we," because the American
public went along with this.  They voted for a second Bush administration
out of fear, so fear is what they're going to have from now on.
 
Our military is completely consumed, so were there a real threat -
thankfully, there is no real threat to the U.S. in the world, but were
there one, we couldn't confront it.  Right now, that may not be a bad
thing, because that keeps Bush from trying something with Iran or with
Venezuela.
 
The harm that has been done is irreparable.  There are more than 2,000
American kids that have been killed.  Tens of thousands of innocent Iraqis
have been killed. ...  It has been a horror, and this administration has
worked overtime to divert the American public's attention from it.  Their
lies are coming home to roost now, and it's gonna fall apart.  But
somebody's gonna have to clear up the aftermath and the harm that it's done
just to what America stands for.  It may be two or three generations in
repairing.

OU agrees to replace destroyed bicycle

ATHENS, Ohio - A graduate student whose bike was mistaken for a pipe bomb
and destroyed by authorities will get a new ride at Ohio University's
expense.
 
OU Director of Legal Affairs John Burns said he'll write a check to
28-year-old Patrick Hanlin "once I figure out how much."
 
The university has agreed to replace Hanlin's bike, which bomb squad
personnel dismantled looking for an explosive device earlier this month
because the bike had a sticker on it promoting the punk band This Bike Is A
Pipe Bomb.

Across the nation, over 600 cyclists are killed on the road every year (662
in 2002, to 626 in 2003 according to NHTSA). A small number compared to the
estimated 300,000 premature deaths estimated to result from overweight and
obesity-related illnesses.
                -- American League of Cyclists
 
Bicycling is part of the solution to many of our nation's problems: the
obesity epidemic, traffic congestion, air pollution and more. Some 64% of
adults and over 15% of kids are overweight today, resulting in 300,000
premature deaths and a cost to society of $117 billion a year. Over 22% of
all motor vehicle trips Americans take are less than one mile long, and 50%
of the working population commutes five miles or less to work, an easily
bikeable distance. If the average person biked to work or shopping once
every two weeks instead of driving, we could prevent the pollution of close
to one billion gallons of gasoline from entering the atmosphere every year.
The League of American Bicyclists' new television and radio PSA campaign
encourages Americans to visit www.bike-to-work.com and bike to work instead
of driving. The League promotes bicycling for fun, fitness and
transportation, and works for a bicycle-friendly America.

Welcome to the Impossible World
 By Rebecca Solnit
 Some of you here today receiving degrees took time off to explore the
world, work for a cause, or earn enough money to get to college, but I
suspect the great majority of you went straight through from high school
and thus were likely born in 1984. What does it mean to be born in 1984,
the ominous year that hung over humanity for 36 years after George Orwell
made those four numbers a synonym for totalitarianism; what does it mean to
be born atop the high wall at the end of the grim future of the
imagination?
 I thought of that as soon as I was invited to give this talk, thought
about the enormous gap between when Orwell, on the beautiful isle of Jura
in Scotland, wrote this bleakest of anti-utopian novels in 1948, and the
actual 1984, as well as the no less profound chasm between 1984, real and
imagined, and the present moment. To contemplate those chasms is to
recognize, in the most literal sense, just how utterly unpredictable the
future is. To recognize that is to realize that a rapidly changing world
requires an ability to appreciate uncertainty, and what in books we call
wild plot twists, at least as much as the wobbly gift of prophesy.

 I thought of these things with the tools with which we English majors
graduate into the world -- not the tools that enable you to splice genes,
cantilever bridges, or make piles of money, but those that enable you to
analyze, to see patterns, to acquire a personal philosophy rather than a
jumble of unexamined, hand-me-down notions; those that enable you not to
make a living but maybe to live. This least utilitarian of educations
prepares you to make sense of the world and maybe to make meaning; for one
way to describe the great struggle of our time is as the endeavor to become
a producer of meanings rather than a consumer of them -- in an age when
meaning as advertising and marketing, as others' definitions of pleasure
and terror, is daily forced dow our throats.
 To make meaning, to change the world, or just to read it thoughtfully
(which can itself be insurrectionary)? And never has our world been so
overloaded, so rapidly changing, and so full of surprises that require us
to change our minds, rethink possibilities, and then do so again; never has
it required such careful reading. In my own case, the kind of critical
reading I first learned to do with books, then with works of art, turned
out to be transferable to national parks, atomic bombs, revolutions,
marches, the act of walking -- a skill transferred not only to feed my
writing but my larger path through the world.
 Books themselves sometimes change the world directly: you can talk about
nonfiction like Diderot's Encyclopeda, about the Communist Manifesto, The
Origin of Species, Upton Sinclair's The Jungle, about an essay that
mattered a great deal only a very long time after it was written, Henry
David Thoreau's "Civil Disobedience," and about a book in that Thoreauvian
vein whose practical impact we might actually be able to measure.

WikiPedia, Number of the Beast, 666             Note 1134

6/6/06    1:50 pm CDT    don appleman / alumni
 
The number 666 retains a peculiar significance in the culture and
psychology of Western societies, where some perceive it as "the Devil's
number", even in contexts usually remote from superstition. The fear of the
number 666 is called hexakosioihexekontahexaphobia.
 
For example:
 
* When the CPU manufacturer Intel introduced the 666 MHz Pentium III in
1999, they chose to market it as the "Pentium III 667", claiming that,
since the actual clock speed was 666.666 MHz, 667 was the more accurate

approximation, against their usual rounding practice, examples of which are
the 66.666 MHz "486-66", the 466.666 MHz "Celeron 466" and the later
866.666 MHz "Pentium III 866".
 
* U.S. Route 666, "the Highway of the Beast", was renumbered as U.S. Route
491 in 2003 after controversy over the supposed reference to the Biblical
beast, which also made the road signs a common target for theft.

Landis had the overall lead after the first really tough mountain stage in
the Alps.  He then lost the lead by eight minutes the next day, falling
into 11th place.  It appeared that his chances of winning were over.
 
The very next day Landis rode a solo, 145-km breakaway on the final
mountain stage, winning by 7:30 and rising to second place, 30 seconds out.
Two days later, in the final stage before the arrival in Paris, Landis won
the individual time trial by a minute and a half, ultimately winning the
overall by 59 seconds in one of the closest, most back-and-forth tours
ever.  Unfortunately, several days later it was revealed that Landis tested
positive for synthetic testosterone on the day of his epic comeback.

The scoreboard said I lost today, but what the scoreboard doesn't say is
what it is I have found.  Over the last 21 years, I have found loyalty.
You have pulled for me on the court and also in life.  I found inspiration.
You have willed me to succeed, sometimes even in my lowest moments, and
I've found generosity.  You have given me your shoulders to stand on to
reach for my dreams, dreams I could never have reached without you.

war on terror, protect our homeland, provide our citizens with Medicare and
Social Security and maintain our domestic priorities, all while cutting
taxes for the wealthy and funding every local project there is.

The report [released Friday 8 September] is the second part of the [Senate
Intelligence] committee's analysis of pre-war intelligence. The first dealt
with CIA failings in its assessment of Iraq's weapons programme.
   
Saddam Hussein was distrustful of al-Qaeda and viewed Islamic extremists as
a threat to his regime, refusing all requests from al-Qaeda to provide
material or operational support,
  
The committee concluded that the CIA had evidence of several instances of
contacts between the Iraqi authorities and al-Qaeda throughout the 1990s but
that these did not add up to a formal relationship.
 
It added that the government "did not have a relationship, harbour or turn a
blind eye toward Zarqawi and his associates".
 
It said that Iraq and al-Qaeda were ideologically poles apart. 
 
"Saddam Hussein was distrustful of al-Qaeda and viewed Islamic extremists as
a threat to his regime, refusing all requests from al-Qaeda to provide
material or operational support," it said.
 
The Senate report added that the Iraqi regime had repeatedly rejected
al-Qaeda requests for meetings.

Yes, it's nice to see the Republicans who chair and form a majority of this
committee finally take a stand against the disinformation used by the
administration to allege ties between Saddam and al Qaeda.

failed only for want of a capable benevolent despot, what chance has

The Safe Accountability For Every Port Act of 2006 authorizes $3.4 billion
over five years for safety measures, including installing radiation
detectors at the 22 largest US ports by the end of next year, and
increasing the number of random searches of the 11 million containers
coming through US ports every year.
 
I'm glad to see Congress and the Administration doing something in this
area.  But I noticed that the $ amount quoted shines a bright light on the
dollar cost of the Iraq war which, at about $1 billion per week, eats up as
much as this 5-year allocation every 25 days or so.

game, but WDWS was carrying UI women's volleyball.  I caught the game on
ESPN radio out of Chicago, but reception was pretty poor.
 
But I found myself musing that with the phone delivering IP via Bluetooth
to the Palm I could stream RealAudio over the web to the Palm, then deliver
it to the car stereo with the FM broadcast module that plugs into the
headphone jack on the Palm.  That would be RealAudio over IP over Bluetooth
over the cellular CDMA network delivered to the stereo via FM.  I'll hafta
try that.

Iran Contra independed counsel on Robert Gates --
 
Independent Counsel found insufficient evidence to warrant charging Robert
Gates with a crime for his role in the Iran/contra affair. Like those of
many other Iran/contra figures, the statements of Gates often seemed
scripted and less than candid. Nevertheless, given the complex nature of
the activities and Gates's apparent lack of direct participation, a jury
could find the evidence left a reasonable doubt that Gates either
obstructed official inquiries or that his two demonstrably incorrect
statements were deliberate lies.

James Baker of the Iraq Study Group is Bush I's go-to guy when W gets in
real trouble (as in Florida 2000).
 
I imagine he sees his mandate as preserving the Bush legacy.  That being
the case, we now have Rumsfeld as the absent scapegoat for the current
situation.  Baker & the ISG will come up with a plan (doesn't matter what
the plan is); Congress will be quick to endorse it, because otherwise
they'd have to come up with their own plan, which would entail
responsbility for its efficacy (something they *really* don't want).
 
Bush then will be able to say that the ISG & Congress have shown him the
only politically practical way forward, and if that plan then fails, it

won't be his fault, it will be the fault of the ISG & Congress.  I'm sure W
and his handlers already blame the electorate for being too weak-minded to
support his proper plan of staying the course.
 
Does that secure the Bush legacy?  Does it harm the newly-Democrat
controlled Congress, or are they protected in the same way as Bush (i.e.,
if the plan fails, it's the ISG's fault)?

The plague of mankind is the fear and rejection of diversity:  monotheism,
monarchy, monogamy and, in our age, monomedicine.  The belief that there is
only one right way to live, only one right way to regulate religious,
political, sexual, medical affairs is the root cause of the greatest threat
to man:  members of his own species, bent on ensuring his salvation,
security, and sanity.

The highest result of education is tolerance.  Long ago men fought and died
for their faith; but it took ages to teach them the other kind of courage,
the courage to recognize the faiths of their brethren and their rights of
conscience.  Tolerance is the first principal of community; it is the
spirit which conserves the best that all men think.

W pushes envelope on U.S. spying
 By James Gordon Meek, Daily News Washington Bureau
 Thursday, January 4th, 2007
 
WASHINGTON - President Bush has quietly claimed sweeping new powers to open
Americans' mail without a judge's warrant, the Daily News has learned.
 
The President asserted his new authority when he signed a postal reform
bill into law on Dec. 20. Bush then issued a "signing statement" that
declared his right to open people's mail under emergency conditions.
 
That claim is contrary to existing law and contradicted the bill he had
just signed, say experts who have reviewed it.
 
Bush's move came during the winter congressional recess and a year after
his secret domestic electronic eavesdropping program was first revealed. It
caught Capitol Hill by surprise.
 
"Despite the President's statement that he may be able to circumvent a
basic privacy protection, the new postal law continues to prohibit the
government from snooping into people's mail without a warrant," said Rep.
Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), the incoming House Government Reform Committee
chairman, who co-sponsored the bill.

Cal Thomas: With what you know now, what might you have done differently in
Iraq?
 
Donald Rumsfeld: I don't think I would have called it the "war on terror."
I don't mean to be critical of those who have.  Certainly, I have used the
phrase frequently.  Why do I say that?  Because the word "war" conjures up
World War II more than it does the Cold War.  It creates a level of
expectation of victory and an ending within 30 or 60 minutes of a soap
opera.  It isn't going to happen that way.  Furthermore, it is not a war on
terror.  Terror is a weapon of choice for extremists who are trying to
destabilize regimes and, [through] a small group of clerics, impose their

Once you've got Baghdad, it's not clear what you do with it ... it's not
clear what kind of government you would put in place of the one that's
currently there now.  Is it going to be a Shia regime, a Sunni regime, or a
Kurdish regime?  Or one that tilts toward the Baathists, or one that tilts
toward the Islamic fundamentalists?  How much credibility is that
government going to have if it's set up by the United States military when
it's there?  How long does the ... military have to stay to protect the
people that sign on for that government, and what happens to it once we
leave?

"The very word "secrecy" is repugnant in a free and open society; and we
are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to
secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the
dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far
outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is
little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its
arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the
survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there
is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be
seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of
official censorship and concealment."

You and I are told increasingly that we have to choose between a left or

right.  There is only an up or down -- up to a man's age-old dream; the
ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order -- or down to
the ant heap of totalitarianism, and regardless of their sincerity, their
humanitarian motives, those who would trade our freedom for security have
embarked on this downward course.

Hi,
 
I have a note on my monitor observing that there is a constant duel between
life being our daily routine, and life being the exceptions to our daily
routine.
 
Every day we do some of the same things; these habits are the fabric of our

 
 
                         There's No Such Thing As Water
File: trvth2                     June 28, 2014                     Page: 371
 
 
daily lives. But a life of pure routine strikes us a a dead-end existence.
We crave the exceptions to routine, the things that make today different
from yesterday, and that promise that tomorrow will be different from
today.
 
Yet when we look back at the "good old days", it's usually a period of
time, not a single event or even a series of events. In looking back we
realize that there can be fulfillment in routine, so long as that routine
is directed at our life's goals (work, wealth, relationships, volunteerism,
whatever goals we set to fulfill our lives).
 
Take a look at your life. Sit back, and see what you've done so far, and
think about what you really wish to have happen. There are a lot of things
that I wish would happen in my life, but some of those wishes don't make it
onto my list of goals because the life I lead isn't directed at fulfilling
those wishes.
 
Of all the things you wish for, decide which of these wishes to make into
goals. Think about how important they are to you; think about how important
it is to make the fulfillment of some of those wishes a part of your future
life. Does it matter? Is it selfish? Does it make me a better person? Does
it do something for the future me? This last question applies to just about
everything, from reading a good book to saving for retirement to raising
kids.
 
Once you've started thinking about these things, you'll find that it's hard
to sort them out. I've told you to prioritize, to make the big decisions
about life on purpose, with your eyes wide open, rather than just coasting
into things. But it doesn't hurt to take some time, coasting along while
you consider these big issues.
 
You'll find over time that some of your wishes should be real goals, that
they're important and that you need to work for them. Other wishes will
lose their appeal; you'll realize that the "future you" doesn't need some
of these wishes fulfilled in order to be a happy and fulfilled person.
 
Take your time. Discuss some of your goals and wishes with your life
partner. Find out what his wishes and goals are. Sometimes you'll share
goals, sometimes your goals will include helping him reach his goals, and
sometimes his goal will be to help you reach your goals.
 
You give up a lot by entering onto a life-path such as marriage at an early
age -- you have obligations, the details of which you did not see before
committing yourself. But that doesn't mean that you're in a positon where
you can't find flfillment. Take some time to sit back, think, share, and
enjoy individual days. Over a period of days and weeks, I think you'll find
that your "true wishes" and goals reveal themselves, that they're not
impossible to reach, and that you can be happy living a life of routine
that is aimed at achieving those goals and making the "future you" a
better, more interesting, more happy person than ever.
 
Love,
Dad

Instead of fighting the real war that was thrust upon us on that
incomprehensible morning four years ago, we stubbornly insisted on fighting
a war of the imagination, an ideological struggle that we defined not by
frankly appraising the real enemy before us but by focusing on the mirror
of our own obsessions.  And we have finished -- as the escalating numbers
of terrorist attacks, the grinding Iraq insurgency, the overstretched
American military and the increasing political dissatisfaction at home show
-- by fighting precisely the kind of war they wanted us to fight.

... In an article in the Asia Times, independent journalist Jim Lobe
interviews Ivan Oelrich, of the Federation for American Scientists, who
says one of the things that concerns him about the [draft Doctrine for
Joint Nuclear Operations plan] is the way that it conflates several
different levels of threats into one form of WMD threat.
 
    "What we are seeing now is an effort to lay the foundations for the
legitimacy of using nuclear weapons if [the administration] suspects
another country might use chemical weapons against us," he said. "Iraq is a
perfect example of how this doctrine might actually work; it was a country
where we were engaged militarily and thought it would deploy chemical
weapons against us."
 
Philip Giraldi, former CIA analyst and member of the Defense Intelligence
Agency, wrote in The American Conservative last month that Vice President
Dick Cheney's office has requested the United States Strategic Command
(STRATCOM) to draw up a plan to respond to another "9/11 type attack on the
US."
 
    The plan includes a large-scale air assault on Iran employing both
conventional and tactical nuclear weapons. Within Iran there are more than
450 major strategic targets, including numerous suspected
nuclear-weapons-program development sites. Many of the targets are hardened
or are deep underground and could not be taken out by conventional weapons,

hence the nuclear option. As in the case of Iraq, the response is not
conditional on Iran actually being involved in the act of terrorism
directed against the United States. Several senior Air Force officers
involved in the planning are reportedly appalled at the implications of
what they are doing--that Iran is being set up for an unprovoked nuclear
attack--but no one is prepared to damage his career by posing any
objections.

On his 17th birthday I wrote in here about my California Cat, Dude.  He was
the oldest cat I've ever owned, and today he gave up the fight after more
than 18 1/2 years.
 
He was born July 9, 1988 behind the couch in the apartment I shared with
then-girlfriend (now ex-wife) Melody in Lakeside, CA, on the same day that
I flew to Illinois to check on job prospects that soon led to my return to
Illinois following a 3-year stint in San Diego.  I had him before and since
my marriage, a fact I find amazing.
 
His father was my cat, "Tranch" (short for Tarantula, a name given by a
friend who was amused by the long white hairs that stood out through his
otherwise smooth black coat); his mother was Melody's cat Gizmo (who
earlier survived a near-fatal encounter with a car, and had pins in her
leg).  On that same morning, my female cat Jasper & Melody's male cat JYC
(Junkyard Cat) had a litter under the dishwasher that included Misty, who
passed away in February of '04.
 
Dude & Misty were the 2 kittens that we brought with us from California
when we moved.  He's older than 3 of my kids (one of whom will graduate
from high school this spring), and remained the alpha male in a 5-cat
household.

Of course, there is no doubt that if we lived in a police state, it would
be easier to catch terrorists.  If we lived in a country that allowed the
police to search your home at any time for any reason; if we lived in a
country that allowed the government to open your mail, eavesdrop on your
phone conversations, or intercept your email communications; if we lived in
a country that allowed the government to hold people in jail indefinitely
based on what they write or think, or based on mere suspicion that they are
up to no good, then the government would no doubt discover and arrest more
terrorists.  But that probably would not be a country in which we would
want to live.  And that would not be a country for which we could, in good
conscience, ask our young people to fight and die.  In short, that would
not be America.

We mistakenly quoted Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison calling for
accountability from top White House aides Libby and Rove by saying,
"Something needs to be said that is a clear message that the rule of law is
intact and the standards for perjury and obstruction of justice are not
gray." In fact, when Senator Hutchison made the remarks, she was calling
for accountability from President Clinton in 1999.  More recently, in
regard to accountability for Libby and Rove, she referred to perjury as a
"technicality." We regret any confusion caused by our error.

TODAY'S WORD: ZEDONK 
 
(ZEE-dongk) 
(n.)  The offspring of a male zebra and a female donkey 
 
Yes, there is such a thing, and "zedonk" is what you get, linguistically
speaking, when you cross a "zebra" with a "donkey."
 
By the way, in case you need a synonym, the Oxford English Dictionary notes
that you can use "zonkey" instead of "zedonk."
 
And while you'd be forgiven for assuming that a "zebrass" is the
unfortunate result of sitting too long on certain lawn chairs, it's
actually yet another name for this hybrid critter.
 
"Yes, a lovely farm indeed, but would you happen to own any zedonks?"

Dissidents should be paid 13 months' salary for a year, otherwise our
mindless unanimity will bring us to an even more hopeless state of
stagnation.  It is especially important to encourage unorthodox thinking
when the situation is critical: At such moments every new word and fresh
thought is more precious than gold.  Indeed, people must not be deprived of
the right to think their own thoughts.

Ultimately, the Court admits that "moral concerns" are at work, concerns
that could yield prohibitions on any abortion. Notably, the concerns
expressed are untethered to any ground genuinely serving the Government's
interest in preserving life. By allowing such concerns to carry the day and
case, overriding fundamental rights, the Court dishonors our precedent.
("Some of us as individuals find abortion offensive to our most basic
principles of morality, but that cannot control our decision. Our obligation
is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral code.") 
 
Revealing in this regard, the Court invokes an anti-abortion shibboleth for
which it concededly has no reliable evidence: Women who have abortions come
to regret their choices, and consequently suffer from "[s]evere depression
and loss of esteem." Because of women's fragile emotional state and because
of the "bond of love the mother has for her child," the Court worries,
doctors may withhold information about the nature of the intact D&E 
procedure. The solution the Court approves, then, is not to require doctors
to inform women, accurately and adequately, of the different procedures and
their attendant risks. Instead, the Court deprives women of the right to
make an autonomous choice, even at the expense of their safety.
 
This way of thinking reflects ancient notions about women's place in the
family and under the Constitution--ideas that have long since been
discredited.

And, I know that I'll hear from them for this.  But, throwing God out
successfully with the help of the federal court system, throwing God out of
the public square, out of the schools.  The abortionists have got to bear
some burden for this because God will not be mocked.  And when we destroy
40 million little innocent babies, we make God mad.  I really believe that

Most people prefer to believe their leaders are just and fair even in the
face of evidence to the contrary, because once a citizen acknowledges that
the government under which they live is lying and corrupt, the citizen has
to choose what he or she will do about it.  To take action in the face of a
corrupt government entails risks of harm to life and loved ones.  To choose
to do nothing is to surrender one's self-image of standing for principles.
Most people do not have the courage to face that choice.  Hence, most
propaganda is not designed to fool the critical thinker but only to give
moral cowards an excuse not to think at all.

His message of peace and reconciliation under almost all circumstances is

We believe at some point, in order to break this dependence on the ...
coalition, you simply have to back off and let the Iraqis step forward.
You have to undercut the perception of occupation in Iraq.  It's very
difficult to do that when you have 150,000-plus, largely western, foreign
troops occupying the country.
 
... I will tell you this, as the operation officer of Centcom, if a year
from now I've got to call on all those army troops that General Schoomaker
[US army chief of staff, who said his office was planning so troop levels
could be maintained until 2009] is prepared to provide, I won't feel real

operated by state governments. This has never been done before in the USA,
and it raises numerous policy, privacy, and data security issues that have
had only brief scrutiny, particularly given the scope and scale of the 
undertaking.
 
It is critical that specific issues be carefully considered before
developing and deploying a uniform identity management system in the 21st
century. These include, but are not limited to, the implementation costs,
the privacy consequences, the security of stored identity documents and
personal information, redress and fairness, "mission creep", and, perhaps
most importantly, provisions for national security protections.
 
The Department of Homeland Security's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking touched
on some of these issues, though it did not explore them in the depth
necessary for a system of such magnitude and such consequence. Given that
these issues have not received adequate consideration, the Committee feels
it is important that the following comments do not constitute an endorsement
of REAL ID or the regulations as workable or appropriate.

It's not about money, it's about freedom.  If you think it's about money
you've missed the point.  I want to use a computer in freedom, to
cooperate, to not be restricted or prohibited from sharing.  The GNU/Linux
system is catching on somewhat more now.  The system is becoming popular
for practical reasons.  It's a good system.  The danger is people will like
it because it's practical and it will become popular without anyone having
the vaguest idea of the ideals behind it, which would be an ironic way of
failing.

The very point of protecting liberty is to demand that sacrifices to
liberty are not in vain and that security interests, which compromise civil
liberties, are sufficiently effective to warrant the cost.

Strength of character does not consist solely in having powerful feelings,
but in maintaining one's balance in spite of them.  Even with the violence
of emotion, judgment and principle must still function like a ship's
compass, which records the slightest variations however rough the sea.

You aren't responsible for how you feel, because feelings just *are*.
What you are responsible for, however, is what you *do* about those
feelings. 
 
You can't be expected to have much control over your feelings -- You
can, however, be expected to have lots of control over your behavior.

Some may belittle politics but we who are engaged in it know that it is
where people stand tall.  Although I know that it has many harsh
contentions, it is still the arena that sets the heart beating a little
faster.  If it is, on occasions, the place of low skulduggery, it is more
often the place for the pursuit of noble causes.  I wish everyone, friend
or foe, well.  That is that.  The end.

18 months after entering Iraq, I see tangible progress.  Iraqi security
elements are being rebuilt from the ground up.
 
The institutions that oversee them are being reestablished from the top
down.  And Iraqi leaders are stepping forward, leading their country and
their security forces courageously in the face of an enemy that has shown a
willingness to do anything to disrupt the establishment of the new Iraq.
...
 
Equipment is being delivered.  Training is on track and increasing in
capacity.  Infrastructure is being repaired.  Command and control
structures and institutions are being reestablished.
 
Most important, Iraqi security forces are in the fight.
