The word "homeland," which resonates sinisterly like das Vaterland in
German or rodina in Russian, was virtually unused before 9/11, and despite
its relentless repetition by the Bush administration (to include the name
of a cabinet agency), it has thus far refused to lodge itself in colloquial
American English. ... Indeed, while Vaterland or rodina have
non-ideological colloquial roots and were expropriated by Hitler and
Stalin, "homeland" is a purely ideological construct of the Bush
administration.

You'll find that you're not the first person who was ever confused and
frightened and even sickened by human behavior.  You're by no means alone
on that score, you'll be excited and stimulated to know.  Many, many men
have been just as troubled morally and spiritually as you are right now.
Happily, some of them kept records of their troubles.  You'll learn from
them -- if you want to.  Just as someday, if you have something to offer,
someone will learn something from you.  It's a beautiful reciprocal
arrangement.  And it isn't education.  It's history.  It's poetry.

Security Consultant Bruce Schneier: By today's rules, I can carry on
liquids in quantities of 3 oz or less, unless they're in larger bottles.
But I can carry on multiple three-ounce bottles.  Or a single larger bottle
with a non-prescription medicine label, like contact lens fluid.  It all
has to fit inside a one-quart plastic bag, except for that large bottle of
contact lens fluid.  And if you confiscate my liquids, you're going to toss
them into a large pile right next to the screening station -- which you
would never do if anyone thought they were actually dangerous.
 
Can you please convince me there's not an Office for Annoying Air Travelers
making this sort of stuff up?
 
Transportation Safety Administration Head Kip Hawley [who apparently has a
sense of humor]:  Screening ideas are indeed thought up by the Office for

fueled.

For example, international terrorism annually causes the same number of
deaths as drowning in bathtubs or bee stings.  It would take a repeat of
Sept. 11 every month of the year to make flying as dangerous as driving.
Over a lifetime, the chance of being killed by a terrorist is about the

Has it been found that bodies of men act with more rectitude or greater
disinterestedness than individuals?  The contrary of this has been inferred
by all accurate observers of the conduct of mankind; and the inference is
founded upon obvious reasons.  Regard to reputation has a less active
influence, when the infamy of a bad action is to be divided among a number
than when it is to fall singly upon one.  A spirit of faction, which is apt
to mingle its poison in the deliberations of all bodies of men, will often
hurry the persons of whom they are composed into improprieties and
excesses, for which they would blush in a private capacity.

And, oh! what beautiful years were these
When our hearts clung each to each;
When life was filled and our senses thrilled
In the first faint dawn of speech.  
 
Thus life by life and love by love
We passed through the cycles strange,
And breath by breath and death by death
We followed the chain of change.

I believe, if we don't fix the health care system, that lack of access will
be a bigger cancer killer than tobacco.  The ultimate control of cancer is
as much a public policy issue as it is a medical and scientific issue.

If a man is offered a fact which goes against his instincts, he will
scrutinize it closely, and unless the evidence is overwhelming, he will
refuse to believe it.  If, on the other hand, he is offered something which
affords a reason for acting in accordance to his instincts, he will accept
it even on the slightest evidence.  The origin of myths is explained in
this way.

Former Secretary of State Colin Powell: What is the greatest threat facing
us now?  People will say it's terrorism.  But are there any terrorists in
the world who can change the American way of life or our political system?
No.  Can they knock down a building?  Yes.  Can they kill somebody?  Yes.
But can they change us?  No.  Only we can change ourselves.  So what is the
great threat we are facing?
 
I would approach this differently, in almost Marshall-like terms.  What are
the great opportunities out there\u2014ones that we can take advantage of?
It should not be just about creating alliances to deal with a guy in a cave
in Pakistan.  It should be about how do we create institutions that keep
the world moving down a path of wealth creation, of increasing respect for
human rights, creating democratic institutions, and increasing the
efficiency and power of market economies?  This is perhaps the most
effective way to go after terrorists.
 
Interviewer: So you think we are getting too hunkered down and scared?
 
Powell: Yes!  We are taking too much counsel of our fears.
 
This doesnt mean there isn't a terrorist threat.  There is a threat.  And
we should send in military forces when we have a target to deal with.  We
should also secure our airports, if that makes us safer.  But let's welcome
every foreign student we can get our hands on.  Let's make sure that
foreigners come to the Mayo Clinic here, and not the Mayo facility in Dubai
or somewhere else.  Let's make sure people come to Disney World and not
throw them up against the wall in Orlando simply because they have a Muslim
name.  Let's also remember that this country was created by immigrants and
thrives as a result of immigration, and we need a sound immigration policy.
 
Let's show the world a face of openness and what a democratic system can
do.  That's why I want to see Guantnamo closed.  It's so harmful to what we
stand for.  We literally bang ourselves in the head by having that place.
What are we doing this to ourselves for? Because were worried about the 380

UK can now demand data decryption on penalty of jail time
By Ken Fisher | Published: October 01, 2007 - 10:20PM CT  
 
 New laws going into effect today in the United Kingdom make it a crime to
refuse to decrypt almost any encrypted data requested by authorities as part
of a criminal or terror investigation. Individuals who are believed to have
the cryptographic keys necessary for such decryption will face up to 5 years
in prison for failing to comply with police or military orders to hand over
either the cryptographic keys, or the data in a decrypted form.
 
 Part 3, Section 49 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA)
includes provisions for the decryption requirements, which are applied 
differently based on the kind of investigation underway. As we reported last
year, the five-year imprisonment penalty is reserved for cases involving
anti-terrorism efforts. All other failures to comply can be met with a
maximum two-year sentence.

Re-reading The Illuminatus Trilogy by Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea,
I came across the following passage ...
 
"... But they can rule by fraud, and by fraud eventually acquire access to
the tools they need to finish the job of killing off the Constitution."

"What sort of tools?"
 
"More stringent security measures.  Universal electronic Surveillance.
No-Knock Laws.  Stop and frisk laws.  Government inspection of first-class
mail.  Automatic fingerprinting, photographing, blood tests and urinalysis
of any person arrested before he is charged with a crime.  A law making it
unlawful to resist even unlawful arrest.  Laws establishing detention camps
for potential subversives.  Gun control laws.  Restrictions on travel.  The
assassinations, you see, establish the need for such laws in the public
mind.  Instead of realizing that there is a conspiracy, controlled by a
handful of men, the people reason - or are manipulated into reasoning -
that the entire populace must have its freedom restricted in order to
protect the leaders.  The people agree that they themselves can't be
trusted. ...
 
"... At present rate, within the next few years the Illuminati will have
the American people under tighter surveillance than Hitler had the Germans.
And the beauty of it is, the majority of the Americans will have been so
frightened by Illuminati-backed terrorist incidents that they will beg to be
controlled as a masochist begs for the whip."
 
From Pages 197-198 of the Dell Trade Paperback edition published in November
1988.  The book was written in 1975.  Sound familiar?

In the distant past it was called feudalism, and in the Nineteenth Century
it was called industrialization.  People with significantly more power than
the rest always exploit the deaths of the less powerful for their gain.  In
a market economy, money is power; this is why extreme income inequality is
a social evil.

I meant to post this last Friday, but it just got better over the weekend.
 
In an amazing streak, baseball's Colorado Rockies won 13 of their final 14
games in the regular season to tie for the wildcard.  That is to say, with
that streak, they managed to tie for "best second place".
 
Since then, they have won a one-game playoff for the wildcard, swept
Philadelphia in 3 games in the Division Series, and are on the verge of a
sweep of Arizona, having won the first 3 in the best-of-seven League
Championship Series.
 
Overall they have won 20 of their last 21 games, including all 7 games
they've played in the post-season.

will achieve victory in that war-torn country or in the greater conflict

Here's a point to ponder.  My ex has no health insurance, and currently has
nine separate prescriptions to address her congestive heart failure and
related maladies.  Of these nine, I've been paying cash for the seven that
cost under $100 per month each, skipping the two remaining, exorbitantly-
priced meds.
 
This week I went to pick up her Albuterol inhaler, which has been available
as a generic for quite a while.  Unfortunately, I discovered that it's no
longer available as a generic.  The pharmaceutical company now has another
2(?) or 3(?) year monopoly on this product which, since it is so widely
prescribed, is probably worth a $billion or so.
 
The change?  The old-style inhaler used CFCs for the propellant; the
new-style inhaler uses something more environmentally friendly.  I'm
guessing that it was big pharma that pushed for the environmental
restriction against CFCs as a propellant for inhalers.  I'm also guessing
that more people will die from not being able to afford inhalers than would
have died from the extra CFCs in the atmosphere.  So, an apparently
innocuous and right-minded environmental law change, meant to keep us
healthy, is likely going to kill people.

Earth to parents:  No.  If you have to call the library and ask if your
child is here, the answer is no.  I know your child probably told you he'd
be at the library, but what that really means is he didn't want to tell you
where he was going to be, either because he hadn't decided yet, or because
he just doesn't want you to know.  This is true for children of all ages,
but of course it goes double for teenagers.
 
Almost all kids who come to the library come with their parents.  If you
aren't here, then your kids almost certainly aren't here either.  Yes, we
do have kids in the library all the time who are not accompanied by their
parents, but it's the same two or three dozen kids all the time.  If your
child were one of them, you would know.
 
Let me reiterate that: if your child were one of the ones who comes to the
library, you would know.  If you have to ask, then he's not here.  Please
stop calling the library and asking if your child is here.  Your child is
not here.

The order of the universe that we live in is the moral order.  It has
become the moral order by becoming the self-conscious method of the members
of a human society.  The world that comes to us from the past possesses and
controls us.  We possess and control the world that we discover and invent.
And this is the world of the moral order.  It is a splendid adventure if we
can rise to it.

Democratic societies, at least, have a right to expect that experts will
help them, experts from all parts of academia and all the professions.  I
would even go so far as to say that there is at least an implicit social
contract between professionals and the democratic societies in which they
live, giving rise to this expectation that professionals will shoulder
their responsibilities to improve the societies in which they live and
work.

I write on napkins.  One time, this seventeen-year-old waitress says to me,
"Do you write on napkins because it doesn't count?" And bingo.  That's
exactly why I do it!  When you're jotting on a napkin, you're not
committing yourself.  It's only a napkin, right? You can throw it away.
You'd be surprised.  It loosens you up.  Some of the best stuff I've
written has been done on napkins.

Amendment doesn't say you have a right to speak out unless the government
has a "compelling interest" in censoring the Internet.  The Second
Amendment doesn't say you have the right to keep and bear arms until some
madman plants a bomb.  The Fourth Amendment doesn't say you have the right
to be secure from search and seizure unless some FBI agent thinks you fit
the profile of a terrorist.  The government has no right to interfere with
any of these freedoms under any circumstances.

The point of terrorism is to cause terror, sometimes to further a political
goal and sometimes out of sheer hatred.  The people terrorists kill are not
the targets; they are collateral damage.  And blowing up planes, trains,
markets or buses is not the goal; those are just tactics.  The real targets
of terrorism are the rest of us: the billions of us who are not killed but
are terrorized because of the killing.  The real point of terrorism is not
the act itself, but our reaction to the act.
 
And we're doing exactly what the terrorists want.
 
[...]
 
The surest defense against terrorism is to refuse to be terrorized.  Our
job is to recognize that terrorism is just one of the risks we face, and
not a particularly common one at that.  And our job is to fight those
politicians who use fear as an excuse to take away our liberties and
promote security theater that wastes money and doesn't make us any safer.

Last night I installed the XLink ITC-BT Bluetooth gateway.  It works as
advertized, which is very cool.
 
Here's the deal -- I ditched my land line ($65 per month) for an additional
cell phone on my Family Share Plan with Verizon Wireless ($9.99 per month).
Now, this creates the problem of having a two-storey house plus basement
with a single cell phone ringing somewhere inside it when someone calls the
house line.
 
This device is the solution.  It connects to your cell phone via bluetooth.
It has a phone jack on the back.  You connect your house phone(s) to the
jack on the back of the device.  It delivers a dial tone for calling out
via house phones, rings the house phones when a call comes in, and passes
through Caller ID.
 
As a bonus, it can connect to as many as 3 cell phones at once, provides
differential ring tones for those cell phones, and allows you to switch
among the cell phones as if on a multi-line phone system.  It also
implements call waiting on your house phones in case of multiple incoming
calls to different cell phones.

I use Google Mail (gmail) as a simple way to get ubiquitous access to my
email with good spam filtering.  They leave stuff in the "spam" folder for
30 days.  And they display how many messages are in your spam folder, so
it's easy to tell (roughly) how many spam messages were received per day
over the past 30 days
 
I'm just guessing here, but I seem to get a lot of spam, and I'm awfully
glad gmail is good at catching it.  For the first time today, my spam
folder hit >10,000 messages.  It currently stands at 10,251 (it was 10,249
when I started typing this), for an average of 341.7 spams per day, which
works out to 14.2 spams per hour, or one spam every 4 minutes, 12 seconds.
 
Now it's at 10,254, up about 300 since yesterday, which indicates a *lot*
of spams in the last 24 hours.

As you may know, my main interest in [communications] is in the use of
satellite relays, which I think may revolutionise the pattern of world
communications.  To the best of my knowledge, I was the first to suggest
this possiblity (see "Extraterrestrial Relays", Wireless World, October
'45). ...  My general conclusions are that perhaps in 30 years the orbital
relay system may take over all the functions of existing surface networks
and provide others quite impossible today.  For example, the three stations
in the 24-hour orbit could provide not only an interference AND censorship-
free global TV service for the same power as a single modern transmitter,
but could also make possible a position-finding grid whereby anyone on
earth could locate himself by means of a couple of dials on an instrument
about the size of a watch.  (A development of Decca and transistorisation.)
It might even make possible world-wide person-to-person radio with
automatic dialling.  Thus no-one on the planet need ever get lost or become
out of touch with the community, unless he wanted to be.  I'm still
thinking about the social consequences of this!

A duel was fought in Texas lately, by Alexander Shott and John S. Nott.
Nott was shot and Shott was not.  In this case it was better to be Shott
than Nott.  There was a rumor that Nott was not shot, but Shott swears he
shot Nott, which proves either that the shot Shott shot at Nott was not
shot, or that Nott is shot notwithstanding.

So there are these ducks that live along the Boulware Trail, a walking path
near my office that runs parallel to a creek.  The ducks are Mallards, and
there are two pairs (that I know of) that live along the creek on the 1/2
mile or so of path that I occasionally walk as a break from work.
 
Today there was quite a ruckus.  One of the pairs of Mallards was being
attacked by a third, male Mallard.  As I watched, the interloper tried
again and again to copulate with the one female.  She resisted by trying to
fly away, but was overpowered.  Her mate resisted by attacking the
interloper, biting him on the head and pushing him underwater.
 
After a few minutes of this, the attacking male apparently got what he came
for and broke off.  The original pair then swam away together.  And it
turns out this isn't so rare.  Mallard rape is well documented, and male
and female duck genitalia have evolved to address this problem.

Political rights do not exist because they have been legally set down on a
piece of paper, but only when they have become the in-grown habit of a
people, and when any attempt to impair them will meet with the violent
resistance of the populace.  Where this is not the case, there is no help
in any parliamentary Opposition or any Platonic appeals to the
constitution.  One compels respect from others when he knows how to defend
his dignity as a human being.  This is not only true in private life; it
has always been the same in political life as well.
 
The peoples owe all the political rights and privileges which we enjoy
today in greater or lesser measure, not to the good will of their
governments, but to their own strength.

2. How would you treat me if you didn't have your prescription pad?
 
3. How are you going to find and treat the cause of my disease, not just
the symptoms?

faster?

Deliberate provocation of mystical experience, particularly by LSD and
related hallucinogens, in contrast to spontaneous visionary experiences,
entails dangers that must not be underestimated.  Practitioners must take
into account the peculiar effects of these substances, namely their ability
to influence our consciousness, the innermost essence of our being.  The
history of LSD to date amply demonstrates the catastrophic consequences
that can ensue when its profound effect is misjudged and the substance is
mistaken for a pleasure drug.  Special internal and external advance
preparations are required; with them, an LSD experiment can become a
meaningful experience.  Wrong and inappropriate use has caused LSD to
become my problem child.

My #2 daughter, Sheena (with the 9-month-old daughter) is 21 and lives at
home with me, along with her boyfriend/father-of-her-child, who will be 20
on 9/11/2008.  She announced last night that she is going to marry him.
And she told me that the wedding is going to be next Thursday, 22 May.  And
he is joining the army the next day.  And she plans to live wherever he is
stationed.
 
I have several problems with this, but the one that bothers me most is the
plan to live wherever he is stationed.  Realistically, I expect him to go
to boot camp for ~8 weeks within a few weeks of enlisting.  During boot
camp she won't be able to stay with him.  After boot camp, he'll get his
assignment.  I expect that a month or two after he gets his assignment,
he'll also get his marching orders to go kick sand in Iraq for 12..15
months.
 
And she plans to live wherever he is stationed.  Which means she'll be
living away from her own family, and away from his family, and away from
him as well, raising their kid with no family support system in place.
That sounds nuts to me.
 
I think that if I had 90 days instead of 9, I could convince her of the
folly of (parts of) her plan.  As it is, the cat is out of the bag -- lots
of people know about the wedding.  Any change in the plan as a result of my
appeals would therefore feel to her (and him, and his family) like
capitulation to my arbitrary, dictatorial whim.
 
So, WTF?  A couple of months ago she considered taking an apartment with
him, but decided against it after agreeing with me that moving into a place
with him was likely to lead to marriage, and she had yet to show any real
interest in marrying him.

And I've told all of my kids (over and over) that they need to live on
their own for at least a year at some point in their lives, just so they
know that they can support themselves.
 
So, how far off am I in my expectations of what will happen after he
enlists?  And what would you say to *your* daughter if she were about to
marry a 19-year-old high school dropout who's joining the military?

Well, it could be even worse than you think.  If the base he is stationed
out of doesn't have available housing she wouldn't even be able to be on
base with other spouses in the same situation.  She might end up living off
base with a housing allowance that doesn't cover the rent.  I don't know
Sheena personally, but the sudden change in her desire to be married
strikes me with some concern.  While it's certainly possible to come to the
realization she's in love and wants to be married, I'd be concerned there
were other issues.
 
All that aside, concerning her would be husband -- I don't particularly
think the military is a terrible decision for a HS dropout who is having
issues with figuring out what he wants to do.  The military often has a way
of getting people to grow up -- it really does help some people.  Of
course, joining the Army during a war is a little less than desirable --
the AF would be better.
           
Living "on her own" would seem to be a moot point to me, given she already
has a 9 month old to take care of.  Hell, I've lived on my own for years
and I don't know if I can support myself after August next year.
 
You're not pitching a reality show are you?  =p
 
Good luck, Don.  It sounds like you could use some.

My experience with this is from having watched my sister and her ex-husband.
They met in college and got married.  He was in the army and got deployed
to Germany (he was in charge of a bunch of tank mechanics).  She moved
with him.  The quick immersion course in german was apparently less than
fun.  When they got to Germany he deployed to the field instantly so she
was left to find housing (living off base), get things set up, wait for
their meager posessions to show up (army isn't exactly fast at shipping).
She spent a couple of years there.  Miserable was a good definition.  Not
many friends, not much chance of employment, not much time with husband,

etc.  She said that living on base would have been worse -- crappy
housing, etc.
 
The guy lived up to my expectations -- that being he was a total *ss.
She finally divorced him, but he's still in her life due to the kids..
Never pays support, is "better" than every job he gets, etc..  
 
Anyway -- I don't think your daughter knows what she's getting into.  When
her soon-to-be hubby gets deployed overseas she'll probably not be able
to find any good housing.  And she'll be doing ALL the work since he'll
be constantly deployed.  If he was promised a posting by the recruiter
he'll most likely be in for a big surprise.  Several stories around here
of recruiters who will say anything to get the recruit.  And then once
they finish boot camp reality sets in -- "good luck in the desert.."

Upon further pondering, I would suggest you work on convincing her to stay
home with you until at least he gets his first assignment.  Then they can
find out what housing situation would be at his home base...  it would be a
start...

Oh, and if he doesn't end up in the infantry, which he probably will, but
if he doesn't -- he'll probably have some kind of "technical school" after
basic.  The first few weeks at this school will be better than basic, but
he probably won't get off the base in the first month.

= Agree.
 
I don't know the specifics, but a possible complication (or amelioration,
depending on how you look at it/how things unfold) is that I think the guy
will get a fat signing bonus, meaning he will have a slug of money in his
pocket.

It may work out.  I'd bet against and make sure that she has the skills to
support herself and her child once he is gone.
 
Convince her to live at home "at first", while he is in training, and while
doing so, consider taking courses at UIUC or Parkland?
 
Show her this thread, so she can see that it isn't just you who
thinks this might be a bad idea?

I suspect the most important thing I would talk to her about would be what
"living wherever he is stationed" looks like.  I just wonder if she is
aware of what "enlisting in the army" looks like?  I'm thinking you should
just print your note to us and show it to her.  It seems pretty reasonable
to me:-)

Long-response warning -- it took me about a half-hour to dump the
following.
 
Thanks everyone, but especially Ray (I was counting on your responses).
You've all been a great help, and I will in fact show her this string,
because I believe there's a lot of good thought reflected here.
 
As it turns out, somewhat less emotional commitment went into this decision
than I initially suspected.  I got an update from my daughter last night
that they are tabling the proposed wedding, and he is not (yet) going into
the military.  I had thought the young couple arrived at a firm plan
through a month or so of consideration.  She says the original decision was
about a week in the making.
 
His family has a multi-generational military tradition, so I wouldn't be
surprised if he ends up there in the long run.  And I wouldn't think that
it's the worst among his options for the future; it may very well be one of
the best.
 
The second- & third-hand information I have is that the recruiter promised
a significant signing bonus (>$10K), and he was signing up to be a diesel
mechanic.  The dealbreakers apparently were the prospect of immediately
doing a combat tour, and immediately being separated from his family for,
presumably, at least 18 months with very little in-person contact during
that time.

I applaud him for his stated commitment to serve, and his willingness to
take big steps to secure a future for himself and his loved ones.  He is
currently working a factory job at which he got a raise and promotion after
just a few months.  He works 40 hours each week, and his boss seems to like
him.  If he were more responsible with money (a skill I trust he will
acquire with maturity) he could, with her help, support a small family in
their own apartment.
 
I applaud her for her willingness to jump off a cliff as a show of
solidarity and commitment.  She also works, about half-time, with her
mother doing babysitting duties while both parents are at work.
 
After a post-event analysis of the misfired wedding, I'll discuss with them
their options for establishing an independent household.  That would give
them a better/bitter taste of real life, increase their freedom from
parental influence, and relieve them of the stigma of living at home.
 
For the record, my efforts were directed not at getting him to not join the
military, but instead at getting her to live at home while her man did his
military thing, rejoining him when he returned stateside.
 
My (thus far failed) argument against early marriage is that young people
are still finding their identities, and therefore don't really know whether
they will be compatible once they've found themselves.  They're just
changing too fast at this age.  I know I was.  This played out in the
two-years-and-done marriage of my oldest daughter (now 22).  After the
divorce, she said it was like she didn't know him at all anymore.
 
This maturing effect is exaggerated, twice over, in the case of one spouse
joining the military.  That experience will a) separate them during their
formative months/years, and b) provide its own maturing influence on the
enlisted spouse which might be incompatible with returning to a young
family, particularly if he sees combat.  Likewise, the personal and
financial hardship experienced by the home-alone spouse would have a big
impact on her.  These major influences, unshared by the couple, could
devestate their relationship, and I have no trouble at all understanding
the high divorce rate among returning soldiers.  It's a wonder that they
can relate to one another at all after what they've been through
separately.  The damage to their families is yet another civil cost of war.
 
Thanks again.

The state can't give you freedom, and the state can't take it away.
Freedom is something you're born with, and then one day someone tries to
deny it.  The extent to which you resist is the extent to which you are
free.

Eddy Merckx: 49.431km in 1 hour.
 
In 1972 Eddy Merckx flew to Mexico City to attempt one of the most
challenging monuments in sport: the hour record.
 
Before the advent of advanced carbon materials, disc wheels and lightweight
components, the hour record stood as the ultimate measure of man-powered
machine.
 
The day's effort has only been topped twice by traditional bicycles as
recognized by the UCI.  In 36 years the distanced traveled in one hour has
grown only 269 meters.

other human beings loved and needed.  ...  [W]hen you teach a man to hate
and to fear his brother, when you teach that he is a lesser man because of
his color, or his beliefs or the policies that he pursues, when you teach
that those who are different from you threaten your freedom or your job or
your home or your family, then you also learn to confront others not as
fellow citizens, but as enemies.  Our lives on this planet are too short,
the work to be done is too great.  But we can perhaps remember, that those
who live with us are our brothers, that they share with us the same short
moment of life, that they seek as do we, nothing but the chance to live out
their lives in purpose and in happiness.  Surely this bond of common fate,

Why are we in this mess?  How did we end up with this crowd in Washington?
Well, we voted for them -- or at least some of us did.  But I'll tell you
what we didn't do.  We didn't agree to suspend the Constitution.  We didn't
agree to stop asking questions or demanding answers.  Some of us are sick
and tired of people who call free speech treason.  Where I come from that's
a dictatorship, not a democracy.
 
And don't tell me it's all the fault of right-wing Republicans or liberal
Democrats.  That's an intellectually lazy argument, and it's part of the
reason we're in this stew.  We're not just a nation of factions.  We're a

Back before we lost our collective minds and began shrieking with horror at
the thought of kids having fun on their own (as in not part of an official
league or otherwise organized activity), they used to do things like find a
vacant field, turn it into a makeshift diamond and spend glorious hours in
the summer sun.

As president, I will order an immediate review of our overseas deployments
- in dozens of countries.  The longstanding commitments we have made to our
allies are the strong foundation of our current peace.  I will keep these
pledges to defend friends from aggression.  The problem comes with
open-ended deployments and unclear military missions.  In these cases we
will ask, "What is our goal, can it be met, and when do we leave?"  As I've
said before, I will work hard to find political solutions that allow an
orderly and timely withdrawal from places like Kosovo and Bosnia.  We will
encourage our allies to take a broader role.  We will not be hasty.  But we
will not be permanent peacekeepers, dividing warring parties.  This is not
our strength or our calling.

I have walked that long road to freedom.  I have tried not to falter; I
have made missteps along the way.  But I have discovered the secret that
after climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills
to climb.  I have taken a moment here to rest, to steal a view of the
glorious vista that surrounds me, to look back on the distance I have come.
But I can rest only for a moment, for with freedom comes responsibilities,
and I dare not linger, for my long walk is not yet ended.

prizes.  It was a 400 meter swim, 6 mile bike ride, and 2 mile run.  My
time was 48:41.4, an improvement of 4:23 over my previous performance.
 
I finished 5th of 17 in my age group (men age 44-49), 56th of 142 among men
of all ages, and 82nd of 305 among all men and women for the entire event.
Of the 223 people I beat, 187 were younger.  Of the 86 men I beat, 74 were

                        -- Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer, in a letter
                           to DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff, explaining
                           why Montana will not participate in Real ID,
                           reported in Canada Free Press, 31 July 2008
                                 
 
More from the article:  After Chertoff called the governor and told
Schweitzer that Montana residents would be banned from airplanes, or
subjected to severe, time-consuming inspections at airports, Schweitzer
replied, "How about we both go on 60 Minutes a few days after the DHS
starts patting down Montana driver's license-holders who are trying to get
on the planes and both of us can tell our side of the story." Chertoff
backed down.  As of the May 11 deadline for implementation, no state is in
compliance with the Real ID Act.

The Current State of Copyright Law is too depressing
 
I regard myself as a centrist.  I believe very much that in proper doses
copyright is essential for certain classes of works, especially commercial
movies, commercial sound recordings, and commercial books, the core
copyright industries.  I accept that the level of proper doses will vary
from person to person and that my recommended dose may be lower (or higher)
than others.  But in my view, and that of my cherished brother Sir Hugh
Laddie, we are well past the healthy dose stage and into the serious
illness stage.  Much like the U.S. economy, things are getting worse, not
better.  Copyright law has abandoned its reason for being: to encourage
learning and the creation of new works.  Instead, its principal functions
now are to preserve existing failed business models, to suppress new
business models and technologies, and to obtain, if possible, enormous
windfall profits from activity that not only causes no harm, but which is
beneficial to copyright owners.  Like Humpty-Dumpty, the copyright law we
used to know can never be put back together again: multilateral and trade

little of robbing; and from robbing he comes next to drinking and

begun upon this downward path, you never know where you are to stop.  Many
a man has dated his ruin from some murder or other that perhaps he thought
little of at the time.

The disdain and uncooperative nature that this administration has shown
toward Congress is so egregious that I can no longer assume that it is
simply bureaucratic incompetence or isolated mistakes.  Rather, I have come
to the sad conclusion that this administration has intentionally obstructed
Congress' rightful and constitutional duties.
 
This administration is setting a terrible precedent.  What people have to
understand is when there is a liberal Democrat in the White House, the
President will have set [the precedent] that Members of Congress can simply
be dismissed, and that when they are trying to do a congressional
investigation need not be cooperated with, in fact, can be obstructed.  Is
that the type of President that we want?  Is that acceptable?  It shouldn't
be acceptable to Democrats and it shouldn't be acceptable to Republicans.
 
It is truly with a heavy heart, Madam Speaker, that I stand here reciting
example after example of the maliciousness and condescending attitude
exhibited by this administration.  It is a problem that's flowing from the
top.  When I hear my friends on the other side of the aisle accusing this
administration of stonewalling, of coverups, or thwarting investigations, I
sadly must concur with them.

the first time in your life last year?  I mean, I don't know what you can
say.  You can't say anything.  ... I think it's a stretch to, in any way,
to say that she's got the experience to be president of the United States.
I think they ought to be just honest about it and stop the nonsense about,
"I look out my window and I see Russia and so therefore I know something
about Russia." That kind of thing is insulting to the American people.

expansion by the banks.  They can thus create an artificial boom and the

The line separating investment and speculation, which is never bright and
clear, becomes blurred still further when most market participants have
recently enjoyed triumphs.  Nothing sedates rationality like large doses of
effortless money.  After a heady experience of that kind, normally sensible
people drift into behavior akin to that of Cinderella at the ball.  They
know that overstaying the festivities -- that is, continuing to speculate
in companies that have gigantic valuations relative to the cash they are
likely to generate in the future -- will eventually bring on pumpkins and
mice.  But they nevertheless hate to miss a single minute of what is one
helluva party.  Therefore, the giddy participants all plan to leave just
seconds before midnight.  There's a problem, though: They are dancing in a
room in which the clocks have no hands.

not only permitted, it is encouraged.  Why not rethink the entire purpose
of our examination system? We should be encouraging students to learn how
to use all possible resources to come up with effective answers to
important problems.  Students should be encouraged to ask others for help,
and they should also be taught to give full credit to those others.  So,
the purpose of this contribution to Ubiquity is to offer an alternative
approach: to examine the origins of cheating, and by solving the root
cause, to simultaneously reduce or eliminate cheating while enhancing
learning.

Today I write not to gloat. Given the pain that nearly everyone is
experiencing, that would be entirely inappropriate. Nor am I writing to
make further predictions, as most of my forecasts in previous letters have
unfolded or are in the process of unfolding. Instead, I am writing to say
goodbye.
 
I was in this game for the money. The low hanging fruit, i.e. idiots whose
parents paid for prep school, Yale, and then the Harvard MBA, was there for
the taking. These people who were (often) truly not worthy of the education
they received (or supposedly received) rose to the top of companies such as
AIG, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and all levels of our government. All
of this behavior supporting the Aristocracy only ended up making it easier
for me to find people stupid enough to take the other side of my trades.
God bless America.
 
On the issue of the U.S. Government, I would like to point out the obvious
flaws, whereby legislation was repeatedly brought forth to Congress over
the past eight years, which would have reined in the predatory lending
practices of now mostly defunct institutions. These institutions regularly
filled the coffers of both parties in return for voting down all of this
legislation designed to protect the common citizen. This is an outrage, yet
no one seems to know or care about it.
 
With that I say goodbye and good luck. 
 
All the best,

Let's talk sense to the American people.  Let's tell them the truth, that
there are no gains without pains, that we are now on the eve of great
decisions, not easy decisions, like resistance when you're attacked, but a
long, patient, costly struggle which alone can assure triumph over the
great enemies of man -- war, poverty, and tyranny -- and the assaults upon
human dignity which are the most grievous consequences of each.

We are feminists or chauvinists.  But in the real world, few of us hold

Dear Sir or Madam,
 
We are writing to let you know that computer tapes containing some of your
personal information were lost while being transported to an off-site
storage facility by our archive services vendor. While we have no reason to
believe that this information has been accessed or used inappropriately, we
deeply regret that this incident occurred and we wanted to explain the
precautionary steps we have taken to help protect you. ...
 
Protecting the confidentiality of this information - and all of our
clients' information - has long been a top priority at The Bank of New York
Mellon. However, in late February 2008, our archive services vendor
notified us that they could not account for one of several boxes of data
backup tapes being transported to an off-site storage facility. The missing
tapes held certain personal information, such as your name, address, Social
Security number and/or shareowner account information. ...
 
Sincerely, Investor Care Response Team

For a long time it had seemed to me that life was about to begin -- real

gotten through first, some unfinished business, time still to be served, a
debt to be paid.  Then life would begin.  At last it dawned on me that
these obstacles WERE my life.

Last year when comparing stats, I resigned myself to losing a chunk of mpg
each year as the car ages.  However, this year two changes came into play:
first, in March I replaced my clutch, and mpg appeared to immediately jump
about 5%.  Second, the price of gas became ridiculous; I replaced my
already fairly sedate driving habits with new ones, and mpg again appeared
to immediately jump about 5%.

This thing started when people with no money and lots of debt, having
little or no way of paying back money, were given loans so others could
profit.  Now we have businesses with no money and lots of debt, having
little or no way of paying the money back, asking for loans so a few can
profit.  Maybe I'm being too simplistic but is seems like a train wreck in
slow motion.

And the leaders of the world today talk eloquently about peace.  Every time
we drop our bombs in North Vietnam, President Johnson talks eloquently
about peace.
 
What is the problem?
 
They are talking about peace as a distant goal, as an end we seek, but one
day we must come to see that peace is not merely a distant goal we seek,
but that it is a means by which we arrive at that goal.
 
We must pursue peaceful ends through peaceful means.
 
All of this is saying that, in the final analysis, means and ends must
cohere because the end is preexistent in the means, and ultimately
destructive means cannot bring about constructive ends.

I'm concerned about justice.  I'm concerned about brotherhood.  I'm

advocate violence.  For through violence you may murder a murderer but you
can't murder murder.  Through violence you may murder a liar but you can't
establish truth.  Through violence you may murder a hater, but you can't
murder hate.  Darkness cannot put out darkness.  Only light can do that.

As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety
and our ideals.  Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can scarcely
imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man,
a charter expanded by the blood of generations.  Those ideals still light
the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake. ...  Recall
that earlier generations faced down fascism and communism not just with
missiles and tanks, but with the sturdy alliances and enduring convictions.
They understood that our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle
us to do as we please.  Instead, they knew that our power grows through its
prudent use.  Our security emanates from the justness of our cause; the
force of our example; the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.
 
For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness.  We
are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus - and nonbelievers.
We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this
Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and
segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united,
we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that
the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller,
our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its

Paul Solman:  An economist comedian, who better to analyze our plight, at
the micro level, individual consumers, and at the macro, the economy as a
whole?  Yoram Bauman asked us to feed him the following straight line.
 
If the U.S. economy were an animal, what animal would it be?
 
Yoram Bauman:  I would have -- I would have to go with a hamster right
now.  And it's a hamster that's been running around its cage, you know, for
maybe seven years.  And it's tired.  So, as a microeconomist, I look at it,
and I think that the hamster needs some rest.  Macroeconomists look at the
hamster and think that the hamster needs some methamphetamines.
 
And I'm sure that they're right.  But, after two years, it's going to be
one ugly hamster.  I mean, it's going to have rotten teeth.  It's going to
have like bloodshot eyes.  It's going to be scratching itself all the time.
You know, there's going to be a price to pay.

We got into this crisis because power was overly concentrated relative to
knowledge.  What has been going on for the past several months is more
consolidation of power.  This is bound to make things worse.  Just as
Nixon's bureaucrats did not have the knowledge to go along with the power
they took when they instituted wage and price controls, the Fed and the
Treasury cannot possibly have knowledge that is proportional to the power
they currently exercise in financial markets.

Part of the debtor mentality is a constant, frantically suppressed
undercurrent of terror.  We have one of the highest debt-to-income ratios
in the world, and apparently most of us are two paychecks from the street.
Those in power -- governments, employers -- exploit this, to great effect.
Frightened people are obedient -- not just physically, but intellectually
and emotionally.  If your employer tells you to work overtime, and you know
that refusing could jeopardize everything you have, then not only do you
work the overtime, but you convince yourself that you're doing it
voluntarily, out of loyalty to the company; because the alternative is to
acknowledge that you are living in terror.  Before you know it, you've
persuaded yourself that you have a profound emotional attachment to some
vast multinational corporation: you've indentured not just your working
hours, but your entire thought process.  The only people who are capable of
either unfettered action or unfettered thought are those who -- either
because they're heroically brave, or because they're insane, or because
they know themselves to be safe -- are free from fear.

Of course, I understand we're all different.  But I can't work out where
you're coming from.  You probably have your reason for doing what you're
doing, and in some parallel universe you might be right.  I'm a very
liberal person, accustomed to seeing other peoples' viewpoints, and that
makes it all the more strange that I can't see yours.  What sort of
character are you?  I just can't make any sense of what you're doing.  I
can't imagine what sort of story you think you're living out.  Don't get me
wrong, I realize you might just be very stupid -- but that stupid?  As it
happens, I'm one of the good guys.  We defeat the bad guys; that's how we
know we're the good guys.  If that hurts, then so be it; you've brought it
on yourself.  You've forced me into seeing you in a way that I don't really
approve of, and that makes me even more angry.  You Bastard!

--
 
The Tooth Fairy Project would like your help with an important scientific
study.
 
In the 1960s, your parents gave one (or more) of your baby teeth to
Washington University in St. Louis to study atomic bomb test fallout. Of
the 300,000 study teeth from people your age, 85,000 were never used --
including yours!
 
Each tooth is in a small envelope, attached to a card with your name, birth
date, and other helpful information that your parents provided when you
were a small boy.
 
Our research group found your current address in the white pages. You and
4,000 other St. Louis-area male tooth donors your age are receiving this
letter. Your answers to the survey below will help us understand if bomb
fallout raised risk of cancer.

"If Congress can do whatever in their discretion can be done by money, and
will promote the general welfare, the government is no longer a limited one
possessing enumerated powers, but an indefinite one subject to particular
exceptions."
 
 
With respect to the two words "general welfare," I have always regarded
them as qualified by the detail of powers connected with them. To take them
in a literal and unlimited sense would be a metamorphosis of the
Constitution into a character which there is a host of proofs was not
contemplated by its creators. If the words obtained so readily a place in
the "Articles of Confederation," and received so little notice in their
admission into the present Constitution, and retained for so long a time a
silent place in both, the fairest explanation is, that the words, in the
alternative of meaning nothing or meaning everything, had the former
meaning taken for granted.
 
Both are comments from James Madison, the Father of the Constitution.

all species have come and gone while the planet has remained.  Saving the
environment is really about saving our environment - making it safe for
ourselves, our children, and the world as we know it.  If more people saw
the issue as one of saving themselves, we would probably see increased
motivation and commitment to actually do so.

Public opinion, or what passes for public opinion, is not invariably a
moderating force in the jungle of politics. It may be true, and I suspect
it is, that the mass of people everywhere are normally peace-loving and
would accept many restraints and sacrifices in preference to the monstrous
calamities of war. But I also suspect that what purports to be public
opinion in most countries that consider themselves to have popular
government is often not really the consensus of the feelings of the mass of

A year ago today I complimented Google for their ability to filter spam,
and griped about the roughly 350 pieces of spam that went into my GMail
spam folder on a daily basis.  At that time, I had 10,251 messages in my
spam folder, and I was receiving spam every 4 minutes, 12 seconds.
 
I don't know whether we're winning the spam wars, or perhaps Google is
doing some upstream spam filtering, but my spam folder currently stands at
1324 messages, an average of just over 44 messages per day, or one every 32
minutes, 37 seconds.  That's about an eight-fold improvement, and now I can
actually check my spam folder for false positives again!

For over 30 years, Dr. Harvey Brenner, a sociologist and public health
expert at Johns Hopkins University and the University of North Texas Health
Science Center, has been carefully studying the link between economic
fluctuations and the nation's physical and mental health.  Based on the
experience of the last half century, he has even estimated how many more
deaths, suicides, heart attacks, homicides, and admissions to mental
hospitals we can expect when unemployment rises.
 
After crunching the numbers, Brenner calculated that for every one percent
increase in the unemployment rate (an additional 1.5 million people out of
work), we can expect an additional 47,000 deaths, including 26,000 deaths
from heart attacks, about 1,200 from suicide, 831 murders, and 635 deaths
related to alcohol consumption.

Wherever the real power in a Government lies, there is the danger of
oppression.  In our Governments, the real power lies in the majority of the
Community, and the invasion of private rights is chiefly to be apprehended,
not from the acts of Government contrary to the sense of its constituents,
but from acts in which the Government is the mere instrument of the major
number of the Constituents.

By speech first, but far more by writing, man has been able to put
something of himself beyond death.  In tradition and in books an integral
part of the individual persists, for it can influence the minds and actions
of other people in different places and at different times: a row of black
marks on a page can move a man to tears, though the bones of him that wrote
it are long ago crumbled to dust.  In truth, the whole progress of
civilization is based upon this power.

Let me tell you a story.  The day after Columbine, I was interviewed for
the Tom Brokaw news program.  The reporter had been assigned a theory and
was seeking sound bites to support it.  "Wouldn't you say," she asked,

"that killings like this are influenced by violent movies?" No, I said, I
wouldn't say that.  "But what about Basketball Diaries?" she asked.
"Doesn't that have a scene of a boy walking into a school with a machine
gun?" The obscure 1995 Leonardo Di Caprio movie did indeed have a brief
fantasy scene of that nature, I said, but the movie failed at the box
office (it grossed only $2.5 million), and it's unlikely the Columbine
killers saw it.  
 
The reporter looked disappointed, so I offered her my theory.  "Events like
this," I said, "if they are influenced by anything, are influenced by news
programs like your own.  When an unbalanced kid walks into a school and
starts shooting, it becomes a major media event.  Cable news drops ordinary
programming and goes around the clock with it.  The story is assigned a
logo and a theme song; these two kids were packaged as the Trench Coat
Mafia.  The message is clear to other disturbed kids around the country: If
I shoot up my school, I can be famous.  The TV will talk about nothing else
but me.  Experts will try to figure out what I was thinking.  The kids and
teachers at school will see they shouldn't have messed with me.  I'll go
out in a blaze of glory."
 
In short, I said, events like Columbine are influenced far less by violent
movies than by CNN, the NBC Nightly News and all the other news media, who
glorify the killers in the guise of "explaining" them.  I commended the
policy at the Sun-Times, where our editor said the paper would no longer
feature school killings on Page 1.  The reporter thanked me and turned off
the camera.  Of course the interview was never used.  They found plenty of
talking heads to condemn violent movies, and everybody was happy.

Coincidentally, all of the kids in my family (my siblings and I) were born
on Wednesdays ... sort of.  John was born Wednesday 14 May 1952, Jim on
Wednesday 26 August 1953, David on Wednesday 1 January 1958, and I was born
on Wednesday 6 May 1959 ... sort of.
 
From the Illinois Dept. of Public Health web site's FAQ on vital records --
 
    Note: Prior to July 1, 1959, births and deaths were to be recorded on
    standard time, even though the community in which the birth or death
    took place was observing daylight savings time. On July 1, 1959, a new
    law became effective legalizing daylight savings time as being state
    standard time between the last Sunday in April at 2 a.m. and the last
    Sunday in October at 2 a.m. Since July 1, 1959, all births and deaths
    are recorded using the current time.
 
So prior to 1 July 1959, roughly 4% (1/24th) of births during DST in
Illinois were recorded in standard time the day before.  Everyone born
between midnight and 1am DST had their birth time recorded as between 11pm
and midnight the night before, in standard time.  This places me among the
last to experience this effect, as I was born at 12:23am on Wednesday 6 May
1959 (by the clock on the wall), which was officially recorded as 11:23pm
on Tuesday 5 May.

with constant repetition you get more and more brazen in the attack.  All
you have to do is to dissolve organizations and societies and banish and
detain the key political workers in these societies.  Then miraculously
everything is tranquil on the surface.  Then an intimidated press and the
government-controlled radio together can regularly sing your praises, and
slowly and steadily the people are made to forget the evil things that have
already been done, or if these things are referred to again they're
conveniently distorted and distorted with impunity, because there will be
no opposition to contradict.

It's easier to start wars than to end them.  It's easier to blame others
than to look inward.  It's easier to see what is different about someone
than to find the things we share.  But we should choose the right path, not
just the easy path.  There's one rule that lies at the heart of every
religion -- that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us.  This
truth transcends nations and peoples -- a belief that isn't new; that isn't
black or white or brown; that isn't Christian or Muslim or Jew.  It's a
belief that pulsed in the cradle of civilization, and that still beats in
the hearts of billions around the world.  It's a faith in other people, and
it's what brought me here today.
 
We have the power to make the world we seek, but only if we have the
courage to make a new beginning, keeping in mind what has been written.
The Holy Koran tells us:  "O mankind!  We have created you male and female;
and we have made you into nations and tribes so that you may know one
another." The Talmud tells us: "The whole of the Torah is for the purpose
of promoting peace." The Holy Bible tells us: "Blessed are the peacemakers,
for they shall be called sons of God."
 
The people of the world can live together in peace.  We know that is God's
vision.  Now that must be our work here on Earth.  Thank you.  And may

It is not bigotry to be certain we are right; but it is bigotry to be
unable to imagine how we might possibly have gone wrong.

This is my last broadcast as the anchorman of The CBS Evening News; for me,
it's a moment for which I long have planned, but which, nevertheless, comes
with some sadness.  For almost 2 decades, after all, we've been meeting
like this in the evenings, and I'll miss that.  But those who have made
anything of this departure, I'm afraid have made too much.  This is but a
transition, a passing of the baton ....  Furthermore, I'm not even going
away!  I'll be back from time to time with special news reports and
documentaries, and, beginning in June, every week, with our science
program, Universe.  Old anchormen, you see, don't fade away; they just keep
coming back for more.  And that's the way it is: Friday, March 6, 1981.

Most people do not accumulate a body of experience.  Most people go through
life undergoing a series of happenings, which pass through their systems
undigested.  Happenings become experiences when they are digested, when
they are reflected on, related to general patterns, and synthesized.

The story of America isn't about people who quit when things got tough.
It's about people who kept going, who tried harder, who loved their country
too much to do anything less than their best.
 
It's the story of students who sat where you sit 250 years ago, and went on
to wage a revolution and found this nation.  Students who sat where you sit
75 years ago who overcame a Depression and won a world war; who fought for
civil rights and put a man on the moon.  Students who sat where you sit 20
years ago who founded Google, Twitter and Facebook and changed the way we
communicate with each other.
 
So today, I want to ask you, what's your contribution going to be?  What
problems are you going to solve?  What discoveries will you make?  What
will a president who comes here in twenty or fifty or one hundred years say
about what all of you did for this country?

Some humans would do anything to see if it was possible to do it.  If you
put a large switch in some cave somewhere, with a sign on it saying
'End-of-the-World Switch. PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH', the paint wouldn't even

Maybe singin' and playin' can bring us together again.

Let me tell you why I'm concerned about these numbers.  That's not how this
was sold to the American people.  It was sold, as stated on DoJ's website
in 2005, as being necessary, quote, "to conduct investigations without
tipping off terrorists."  I'm going to say, it's quite extraordinary to
grant govenment agents the statutory authority to secretly break in to
Americans' homes in criminal cases.  And I think some Americans might be
concerned that it's been used hundreds of times in just a single year in
non-terrorism cases.

                           year, just three had to do with terrorism
                           investigations.  23 September 2009

the last ninety-three days of repression, I think that any of those doubts

suppressing the rights of its citizens and which is oppressing the Honduran
people.

While few would argue that criminals ought to be able to keep the proceeds
of their crimes, civil forfeiture allows the government to seize and keep
property without actually having to prove a crime was committed in the
first place. ...  Proceeds from civil forfeiture at the state and local
level usually go back to the police departments and prosecutors' offices,
giving them a clear and unmistakable incentive to seize as much property as
often as possible.

Songwriting is about getting the demon out of me.  It's like being
possessed.  You try to go to sleep, but the song won't let you.  So you
have to get up and make it into something, and then you're allowed to
sleep.  It's always in the middle of the bloody night, or when you're
half-awake or tired, when your critical faculties are switched off.  So
letting go is what the whole game is.  Every time you try to put your
finger on it, it slips away.  You turn on the lights and the cockroaches
run away.  You can never grasp them.

the safety is always necessarily an illusion.  Artists are here to disturb
the peace.

If the world were a village of 100 people ....
 
6 people (all in the USA) would own 59% of all the village's wealth,
74 people would share another 39%, and
20 people would share the remaining 2%.

The absence of a time frame for transition would deny us any sense of

All I ask is this: Do something.  Try something.  Speaking out, showing up,
writing a letter, a check, a strongly worded e-mail.  Pick a cause -- there
are few unworthy ones.  And nudge yourself past the brink of tacit support
to action.  Once a month, once a year, or just once.

MPG dropped by a fraction, but not by much; I can still claim my car gets
35mpg.  The drop in cost for a gallon of gas surprises me -- cheapest year
so far, despite the high miles.  I ran up the most miles for a year, but
not the most gallons of gas.  Now I need to cut mileage to <25,000 again.

Cowardice asks the question, "Is it safe?" Expediency asks the question,

asks the question, "Is it right?" And there comes a time when one must take
a position that is neither safe, nor politic, nor popular but one must take
it because one's conscience tells one that it is right.

Palm Pre+ (Verizon) for me today.  I've been carrying a Palm Centro as my
combination cell phone/calendar/contacts/clock/music system/data caddy for
the past year and a half or so.  From the little I've played with it so
far, the Pre does *not* feel like a Palm.  It does feel like a slick
high-tech device.
 
I've spent over 7 years learning all the Palm OS applications that are
useful for the types of things I like to do.  I hope it's quicker (and
cheaper) to find and learn to use the best Pre software.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.  Think of the
rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in
glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of
a dot.  Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one
corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some
other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to
kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

After all these years, my passion for service to my fellow citizens is
undiminished, but my desire to do so by serving in Congress has waned.  For
some time, I have had a growing conviction that Congress is not operating
as it should.  There is too much partisanship and not enough progress --
too much narrow ideology and not enough practical problem-solving.  Even at
a time of enormous challenge, the peoples' business is not being done.
 
... All of this and much more has led me to believe that there are better
ways to serve my fellow citizens, my beloved state, and our nation than
continued service in Congress.
 
To put it in words most people can understand: I love working for the
people of Indiana, I love helping our citizens make the most of their
lives, but I do not love Congress.  I will not, therefore, be a candidate
for election to the Senate this November.

Ethics versus Morals.  Ethical behavior may be defined as acting after
thinking about what would produce the greatest good for the greatest number
affected.  Morals are a codification of prior ethical decisions, simplified
into easy-to-grasp rules.  Morals exist because most people are very
uncomfortable with the uncertainties of attempting to figure out what the
right course of action might be, and most and are reluctant to take
responsibility for having made mistakes.  Being ethical means making
decisions based on inadqeuate data and acting anyway.  Ethical actions
frequently work out badly; the actor has no one to blame for the results

but themselves.  Acting ethically while still desiring certainties means
being uncomfortable.  Moral acts also often work out badly.  The apparent
advantage to being moral is that when a moral act works out badly no one is
to blame because the actor did what was supposed to be done.  Being moral
is comfortable because a moral person always knows what should be done, did
it and is not to blame for the outcomes.

There is no moral precept that does not have something inconvenient about
it.

The DOT policy is to incorporate safe and convenient walking and bicycling
facilities into transportation projects.  Every transportation agency,
including DOT, has the responsibility to improve conditions and
opportunities for walking and bicycling and to integrate walking and
bicycling into their transportation systems.  Because of the numerous
individual and community benefits that walking and bicycling provide --
including health, safety, environmental, transportation, and quality of
life -- transportation agencies are encouraged to go beyond minimum
standards to provide safe and convenient facilities for these modes.

Adulthood is awesome.  Adulthood can be everything childhood is but way
better.  Some people say they "were allowed" to do things as children and
they were so much freer and less inhibited; I say if you're inhibited and
unfree as an adult, you're not doing it right.  You're missing all that
adulthood has to offer.  Ultimately the only one oppressing you as an adult
is YOU.  If you compare adulthood to childhood and childhood comes out
favorably, you are missing the best part of your life.

New construction in East Jerusalem or the West Bank undermines that mutual
trust and endangers the proximity talks that are the first step toward the
full negotiations that both sides say they want and need.  And it exposes
daylight between Israel and the United States that others in the region
hope to exploit.  It undermines America's unique ability to play a role, an
essential role, in the peace process.

Here's an update on the Palm Pre, now that I've been using it for a little
over 2 months.
 
Over Easter weekend, I used it on a trip to southern Illinois.  Throughout
the trip I used it for GPS, streaming music from the Internet, streaming
that same music from the Pre to the bluetooth speakers in my car, and as a
phone (all at once).  With the Pre plugged into the adapter in my car, it's
power draw was close to break even; the battery actually went down a little
(from 100% to 80%) during a 2.5-hour drive.  Additionally, it got a little
warm while charging and running all of these radios & apps at the same
time.  Once I arrived at my destination, I was able to use WiFi
connectivity for faster Internet.
 
Having always-on Internet in my pocket changes the way I use the Internet.
When a point of trivia arises, instead of thinking "I could google that", I
just go ahead and google it.  I carry my Pre loose in my pocket, though I
did apply a full-body Zagg (indestructible, thin, nano-tech) skin.
 
Pros:  
* Always-on Internet, with easy access to Google, Wikipedia, Youtube, etc.
* True multi-tasking, with notification area for updates from running apps
* Automatic, background syncing of contacts, etc. with Internet services;
    no backups required. If you lose your device, a replacement device will
    have all of your apps/contacts/etc. automatically, within a few minutes
    of activation.
* GPS with Google Maps built in, 802-11b/g WiFi, Bluetooth 2.1
* Accelerometer for game control using tilt, shake, etc.  
* Attractive 3.1" 480x320 display w/3D graphics and 16M colors
* Touch-active screen with multi-touch (pinch/spread to zoom, etc.)
* Proximity sensor disables touch screen when you hold the phone to your
    ear
* Video playback

* Desktop-style web browser
* Appears as a removable USB drive if you connect it to your PC, allowing
    file transfer via drag-and-drop
* Ability to use the cellular Internet connection + WiFi to create a mobile
    WiFi-anywhere hotspot supporting up to 5 other devices (Verizon charges
    for this, and I haven't actually tried it).  Laptop owners who don't
    mind the cost should love this.
* Linux under the hood, with easy access to a root prompt for tinkering;
    WebOS is a joy to use
* Well-developed community of users whose work provides features and
    enhancements otherwise pricey or not available
* Palm App Store & community app store on the device; all software added
    wirelessly.  It's possible to own a Pre and never use its USB cable.  
* 3M-pixel camera with flash and video capture
* Regular software updates from Palm (from v1.3.5 to v1.3.5.1, and then to
    v1.4, since mid-January)
* Best cellular connectivity I've had (I no longer need to leave the
    basement at home when a call comes in)
* 16GB storage
* QWERTY keyboard
* Hardware mute, LED notifications, hard volume buttons, all work even when
    device is sleeping
* All-day battery life when you're not torturing the device; I torture mine
    daily, but I also charge it nightly, and can charge it at work if
    necessary.  
* Optional Touchstone charging system (wireless magnetic inductive
    coupling); I have one at home, and another at work.
 
Cons:
* Biggest problem - the keyboard sometimes bounces and/or drops keypresses,
    making proofreading a necessity
* Lack of a 5-way navigator (up/down/right/left/OK), making editing out
    those typos more awkward
* Touchstone charging devices are sometimes flaky, charging to only about
    90% before losing connectivity; I have 2 of these, and one is flawless,
    the other flaky
* Aggressive power-saving; when the device auto-sleeps, the GPS stops
    updating and needs to re-sync on wake.  The background "cron" service
    also sleeps, though this is moot unless you're tinkering.
* GPS draws a lot of power; continuous use of GPS (not plugged in,
    auto-sleep disabled) yields ~2.5 hours battery life
* Streaming music from the Internet and re-streaming it via Bluetooth uses
    a lot of power; continuous use for music like this (not plugged in)
    yields ~4 to 5 hours battery life
* No expandable memory, though I use a tiny fraction of the 16GB capacity;
    if I added movie-length videos this might matter.
 
[Edit -- writing this review was a good exercise; I now feel even better
about owning/using my Palm Pre.  If the keyboard were more reliable, this
device would be nearly perfect.]

Money is property; it is not speech.  Speech has the power to inspire
volunteers to perform a multitude of tasks on a campaign trail, on a
battleground, or even on a football field.  Money, meanwhile, has the power
to pay hired laborers to perform the same tasks.  It does not follow,
however, that the First Amendment provides the same measure of protection
to the use of money to accomplish such goals as it provides to the use of
ideas to achieve the same results.

No greater mistake can be made than to think that our institutions are
fixed or may not be changed for the worse. ... Increasing prosperity tends
to breed indifference and to corrupt moral soundness.  Glaring inequalities
in condition create discontent and strain the democratic relation.  The
vicious are the willing, and the ignorant are unconscious instruments of
political artifice.  Selfishness and demagoguery take advantage of liberty.
The selfish hand constantly seeks to control government, and every increase
of governmental power, even to meet just needs, furnishes opportunity for
abuse and stimulates the effort to bend it to improper uses. ... The peril
of this Nation is not in any foreign foe!  We, the people, are its power,
its peril, and its hope!

far stronger enemy into a self-defeating response.

You've no doubt figured out my bias by now.  I've hardly kept it a secret.
In this regard, I take my cue from the late Edward R. Murrow, the Moses of

as long as you don't try to hide it.  So here, one more time, is mine:
plutocracy and democracy don't mix.  Plutocracy, the rule of the rich,
political power controlled by the wealthy.  Plutocracy is not an American
word but it's become an American phenomenon.

The party that claims to represent all progressive interests in this
country proceeds with its impervious, self-interested agenda.  The
administration's stated priorities for the near future are to balance the
budget before a deep recession has abated and to commit the nation to a
long-running war in a dysfunctional Asian country that we neither
understand nor care about -- thereby promising to repeat, simultaneously,
the two worst mistakes made by liberal presidents in the past seventy-five
years.  As for the long term, the White House will form a commission bent
on cutting 'entitlements,' such as Social Security and Medicare, that are
the bedrock of retired Americans' prosperity ...
 
It is increasingly clear that [Obama] never intended to challenge the power
structure he had so skillfully penetrated ....  There is no longer any
meaningful reformist impulse left in our politics.  The idea of modern
American liberalism has vanished among our elite, and simply voting for one
man or supporting one of the two major parties will not restore it.

There is nothing which I dread so much as a division of the republic into
two great parties, each arranged under its leader, and concerting measures
in opposition to each other.  This, in my humble apprehension, is to be
dreaded as the greatest political evil under our Constitution.

Patriotism is proud of a country's virtues and eager to correct its
deficiencies; it also acknowledges the legitimate patriotism of other
countries, with their own specific virtues.  The pride of nationalism,
however, trumpets its country's virtues and denies its deficiencies, while
it is contemptuous toward the virtues of other countries.  It wants to be,
and proclaims itself to be, "the greatest", but greatness is not required
of a country; only goodness is.

There is but one mode by which man can possess in perpetuity all the
happiness which his nature is capable of enjoying, -- that is by the union
and co-operation of all for the benefit of each.  Union and co-operation in
war obviously increase the power of the individual a thousand fold.  Is
there the shadow of a reason why they should not produce equal effects in
peace; why the principle of co-operation should not give to men the same
superior powers, and advantages, (and much greater) in the creation,
preservation, distribution and enjoyment of wealth?

The issue in this case is the right of citizens to be able to go to court
to challenge government action.  Here, the government is trying to
assassinate a US citizen who they say is a terrorist.  The ACLU and the
Center for Constitutional Rights are trying to go into court to challenge
that assassination effort, but at this point we have to get permission from
the government to even go into court to represent them to raise these
constitutional issues.  So we think it's unconstitutional, and we're asking
that the court strike that down and allow us to get to the point of this,
which is under what circumstances can the government execute somebody
without due process of law.

Monsters remain human beings.  In fact, to reduce them to a subhuman level
is to exonerate them of their acts of terrorism and mass murder -- just as
animals are not deemed morally responsible for killing.  Insisting on the
humanity of terrorists is, in fact, critical to maintaining their profound
responsibility for the evil they commit.

And, if they are human, then they must necessarily not be treated in an
inhuman fashion.  You cannot lower the moral baseline of a terrorist to the
subhuman without betraying a fundamental value.

What is essentially unfolding here is a downsized and rebranded occupation,
Obama-style, that is going to necessitate a surge in private forces.  The
State Department is asking for MRAP vehicles, armored vehicles, for Black
Hawk helicopters and for these paramilitary forces.  So, yes, you can say
that officially combat has ended, but in reality we're continuing it
through the back door by bringing in these paramilitary forces and
classifying them as diplomatic security, which was Bush's game from the
very beginning.

The owner of the private military firm Blackwater, Erik Prince, has
reportedly left the United States and moved to the United Arab Emirates.
The New York Times reports Prince has set up shop in Abu Dhabi, where he
hopes to win "focus on security work from governments in Africa and the
Middle East." Independent journalist and Democracy Now! correspondent
Jeremy Scahill was the first to report Prince's moving plans two months
ago.  Five of Prince's deputies were indicted on weapons charges in April,
and Prince put Blackwater up for sale in June.  At the time, Scahill said
Prince may have favored a move to the UAE in part because it has no
extradition treaty with the United States.  A colleague of Prince's told
the New York Times, "He needs a break from America."

If you can't admit you're wrong, you should just stay home and knit
sweaters.  You shouldn't be involved with any occupation where your
decision-making can have an impact on other people's health, life, or
liberty.
 
I don't think it's specific to the legal system.  I think generally
speaking it's difficult for people to admit they're wrong, and the higher
the stakes, the more difficult it becomes.  So what you really want to do
is educate people that it's OK to be wrong.  It doesn't mean you're a fool.
It's not going to be the end of your life.

Wyoming Town Near Drilling Told Drinking Water Unsafe, Potentially
Explosive
 
Residents of a Wyoming town where natural gas drilling has occurred for
years are now being warned their water is not only undrinkable but
potentially explosive.  The Environmental Protection Agency issued the
warning after a second round of testing on the town of Pavilion's water
supply.  The first round found at least three water wells contained
chemicals used in the natural gas drilling process of hydraulic fracturing.
ProPublica reports the latest tests confirmed the presence of those
chemicals as well as benzene, metals, naphthalene, phenols and methane.  In
addition to being told not to drink their water, Pavilion residents are
also being advised to use fans and ventilation when showering or washing
clothes to avoid the risk of explosions.

There are people for whom nothing is more embarrassing than to be caught
not in the know.  To arm themselves against embarrassment, they choose
knowingness, which is just ignorance hidden by information.

FDA Barring Food Makers from Advertising Products as GMO-Free
 
The FDA meanwhile appears to be enforcing a policy of barring food
producers from trumpeting that their products don't contain genetically
modified ingredients. According to the Washington Post, the FDA has sent a
"flurry of enforcement letters" to companies that have advertised GMO-free
products on their labels. The warnings come on top of existing policy not
to require food makers to disclose if their products do contain GMOs.
Congress member Dennis Kucinich said, "This, to me, raises questions about
whose interest the FDA is protecting. They are clearly protecting industry,
and not the public."

Extremism.  It is an almost infallible sign -- a kind of death-rattle --
when a human institution is forced by its members into stressing those and
only those factors which are identificatory, at the expense of others which
it necessarily shares with competing institutions because human beings
belong to all of them.

drawn, to YouTube.
 
Plitt also dismissed a charge of possession of "a device primarily useful

(the helmet camera), saying it would render illegal cell phones and other
handheld recording devices used by many.

When the modern corporation acquires power over markets, power in the
community, power over the state and power over belief, it is a political
instrument, different in degree but not in kind from the state itself.  To
hold otherwise -- to deny the political character of the modern corporation
-- is not merely to avoid the reality.  It is to disguise the reality.  The
victims of that disguise are those we instruct in error.  The beneficiaries
are the institutions whose power we so disguise.  Let there be no question:
economics, so long as it is thus taught, becomes, however unconsciously, a
part of the arrangement by which the citizen or student is kept from seeing
how he or she is, or will be, governed.

At first I hoped that such a technically unsound project would collapse but
I soon realized it was doomed to success.  Almost anything in software can
be implemented, sold, and even used given enough determination.  There is
nothing a mere scientist can say that will stand against the flood of a
hundred million dollars.  But there is one quality that cannot be purchased
in this way -- and that is reliability.  The price of reliability is the
pursuit of the utmost simplicity.  It is a price which the very rich find
most hard to pay.

The existence of such a government as ours for any length of time is a full
proof of a general dissemination of knowledge and virtue throughout the
whole body of the people.  And what object or consideration more pleasing
than this can be presented to the human mind?  If national pride is ever
justifiable or excusable it is when it springs, not from power or riches,
grandeur or glory, but from conviction of national innocence, information,
and benevolence.
 
In the midst of these pleasing ideas we should be unfaithful to ourselves
if we should ever lose sight of the danger to our liberties if anything
partial or extraneous should infect the purity of our free, fair, virtuous,
and independent elections.  If an election is to be determined by a
majority of a single vote, and that can be procured by a party through
artifice or corruption, the Government may be the choice of a party for its
own ends, not of the nation for the national good.  If that solitary
suffrage can be obtained by foreign nations by flattery or menaces, by
fraud or violence, by terror, intrigue, or venality, the Government may not
be the choice of the American people, but of foreign nations.  It may be
foreign nations who govern us, and not we, the people, who govern
ourselves; and candid men will acknowledge that in such cases choice would
have little advantage to boast of over lot or chance.

others, you must accept the rule of the majority.  But any rule is tyranny.
The duty of the individual is to accept no rule, to be the initiator of his
own acts, to be responsible.  Only if he does so will the society live, and
change, and adapt, and survive.  We are not subjects of a State founded
upon law, but members of a society founded upon revolution.  Revolution is
our obligation: our hope of evolution.

Public opinion rarely considers the needs of the next generation or the
history of the last.  It is frequently hampered by myths and
misinformation, by stereotypes and shibboleths, and by an innate resistance
to innovation.

The more secretive or unjust an organization is, the more leaks induce fear
and paranoia in its leadership and planning coterie.  This must result in
minimization of efficient internal communications mechanisms (an increase
in cognitive "secrecy tax") and consequent system-wide cognitive decline
resulting in decreased ability to hold onto power as the environment
demands adaption.
 
Hence in a world where leaking is easy, secretive or unjust systems are
nonlinearly hit relative to open, just systems.  Since unjust systems, by
their nature induce opponents, and in many places barely have the upper
hand, mass leaking leaves them exquisitely vulnerable to those who seek to
replace them with more open forms of governance.
 
Only revealed injustice can be answered; for man to do anything intelligent
he has to know what's actually going on.

I think all the heretics I have known have been virtuous men.  They have
the virtue of fortitude or they would not venture to own their heresy; and
they cannot afford to be deficient in any of the other virtues, as that
would give advantage to their many enemies; and they have not like orthodox
sinners, such a number of friends to excuse or justify them.  Do not,
however mistake me.  It is not to my good friend's heresy that I impute his
honesty.  On the contrary, 'tis his honesty that has brought upon him the
character of heretic.

It is the invariable habit of bureaucracies, at all times and everywhere,
to assume ... that every citizen is a criminal.  Their one apparent
purpose, pursued with a relentless and furious diligence, is to convert the
assumption into a fact.  They hunt endlessly for proofs, and, when proofs
are lacking, for mere suspicions.  The moment they become aware of a
definite citizen, John Doe, seeking what is his right under the law, they
begin searching feverishly for an excuse for withholding it from him.

[Excerpted from the longer passage below, and self-consciously changing the
meaning from an endorsement of religion to a possible criticism thereof.]
 
A religious education is an education which inculcates duty and reverence.
Duty arises from our potential control over the course of events.  Where
attainable knowledge could have changed the issue, ignorance has the guilt
of vice.  And the foundation of reverence is this perception, that the
present holds within itself the complete sum of existence, backwards and
forwards, that whole amplitude of time, which is eternity.

After careful consideration, including review of a recommendation from me,
the President of the United States has made the determination that Section
3 of the Defense of Marriage Act ("DOMA"), 1 U.S.C. 7, i as applied to
same-sex couples who are legally married under state law, violates the
equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
530D, I am writing to advise you of the Executive Branch's determination
and to inform you of the steps the Department will take in two pending DOMA
cases to implement that determination. ...
 
As described more fully below, the President and I have concluded that
classifications based on sexual orientation warrant heightened scrutiny and
that, as applied to same-sex couples legally married under state law,
Section 3 of DOMA is unconstitutional.

It is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of
government to their selfish purposes.  Distinctions in society will always
exist under every just government.  Equality of talents, of education, or
of wealth can not be produced by human institutions.  In the full enjoyment
of the gifts of Heaven and the fruits of superior industry, economy, and
virtue, every man is equally entitled to protection by law; but when the
laws undertake to add to these natural and just advantages artificial
distinctions, to grant titles, gratuities, and exclusive privileges, to
make the rich richer and the potent more powerful, the humble members of
society -- the farmers, mechanics, and laborers -- who have neither the
time nor the means of securing like favors to themselves, have a right to
complain of the injustice of their government.

I voted to uphold the death penalty.  And I thought, at the time, that if
the universe of defendants eligible for the death penalty is sufficiently
narrow, so that you can be confident that the defendant really merits that
severe punishment, that the death penalty was appropriate.  But what
happened over the years is the court constantly expanded the cases eligible
for the death penalty, so that the underlying premise for my vote in those
cases has disappeared, in a sense.

An education isn't how much you have committed to memory, or even how much

what you don't.  It's knowing where to go to find out what you need to
know; and it's knowing how to use the information you get.

Had this case proceeded in Manhattan or in an alternative venue in the
United States, as I seriously explored in the last year, I am confident
that our justice system could have performed with the same distinction that
has been its hallmark for over 200 years.  Now, unfortunately, since I made
that decision, members of Congress have intervened and imposed restrictions
blocking the administration from bringing any Guantanamo detainees to trial
in the United States, regardless of the venue.  As the President has said,
those unwise and unwarranted restrictions undermine our counterterrorism

In the United States a handful of corporations centralize decisions and
responsibilities that are relevant for military and political as well as
economic developments of global significance.  For nowadays the military
and the political cannot be separated from economic considerations of
power.  We now live not in an economic order or a political order, but in a
political economy that is closely linked with military institutions and
decisions.  This is obvious in the repeated "oil crisis" in the Middle
East, or in the relevance of Southeast Asia and African resources for the
Western powers.

They know of no solutions to the paradoxes of the Middle East and Europe,
the Far East and Africa except the landing of Marines.  Being baffled, and
also being very tired of being baffled, they have come to believe that
there is no way out -- except war -- which would remove all the bewildering
paradoxes of their tedious and now misguided attempts to construct peace.
In place of these paradoxes they prefer the bright, clear problems of war
-- as they used to be.  For they still believe that "winning" means

Difference of opinion is advantageous in religion.  The several sects
perform the office of a Censor morum over each other.  Is uniformity
attainable?  Millions of innocent men, women, and children, since the
introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, imprisoned;
yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity.  What has been the
effect of coercion?  To make one half the world fools, and the other half
hypocrites.  To support roguery and error all over the earth.  Let us
reflect that it is inhabited by a thousand millions of people.  That these
profess probably a thousand different systems of religion.  That ours is
but one of that thousand.  That if there be but one right, and ours that
one, we should wish to see the 999 wandering sects gathered into the fold
of truth.  But against such a majority we cannot effect this by force.
Reason and persuasion are the only practicable instruments.  To make way
for these, free enquiry must be indulged; and how can we wish others to
indulge it while we refuse it ourselves?

Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day,
Fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way.
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town,
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.
 
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain,
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today.
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you,
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun.
 
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun
But it's sinking, racing around to come up behind you again.
The sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older,
Shorter of breath, one day closer to death.
 
Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time,
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines.
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way.
The time is gone, the song is over, thought I'd something more to say.
 
Home, home again, I like to be here when I can.
When I come home, cold and tired,
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire.
 
Far away across the field, tolling on the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees, to hear the softly spoken magic spell.

As a matter of general principle, I believe there can be no doubt that
criticism in time of war is essential to the maintenance of any kind of
democratic government ... too many people desire to suppress criticism
simply because they think that it will give some comfort to the enemy to
know that there is such criticism.  If that comfort makes the enemy feel
better for a few moments, they are welcome to it as far as I am concerned,
because the maintenance of the right of criticism in the long run will do
the country maintaining it a great deal more good than it will do the
enemy, and will prevent mistakes which might otherwise occur.

All of us encounter, at least once in our life, some individual who utters
words that make us think forever.  There are men whose phrases are oracles;
who condense in one sentence the secrets of life; who blurt out an aphorism
that forms a character or illustrates an existence.

I've sought further information from the staff of the Senate Intelligence
Committee, and they confirmed for me that, in fact, the best intelligence
gained from a CIA detainee -- information describing Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti's
real role in al-Qaeda and his true relationship to Osama bin Laden -- was
obtained through standard, non-coercive means, not through any "enhanced
interrogation technique." In short, it was not torture or cruel, inhuman
and degrading treatment of detainees that got us the major leads that
ultimately enabled our intelligence community to find Osama bin Laden.  I
hope former Attorney General Mukasey will correct his misstatement. ...
 
Ultimately, this is about morality.  What is at stake here is the very idea
of America -- the America whose values have inspired the world and
instilled in the hearts of its citizens the certainty that, no matter how
hard we fight, no matter how dangerous our adversary, in the course of
vanquishing our enemies we do not compromise our deepest values.  We are
America, and we hold ourselves to a higher standard.  That is what is
really at stake.

I'm not afraid of death, but I'm in no hurry to die.  I have so much I want

its components fail.  There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down
computers; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark.

A constitution is not the act of a government, but of a people constituting
a government; and government without a constitution is power without a
right.  All power exercised over a nation, must have some beginning.  It
must be either delegated, or assumed.  There are not other sources.  All
delegated power is trust, and all assumed power is usurpation.  Time does
not alter the nature and quality of either.

Do you think every hacker announces everything they've hacked?  We
certainly haven't, and we're damn sure others are playing the silent game.
Do you feel safe with your Facebook accounts, your Google Mail accounts,
your Skype accounts?  What makes you think a hacker isn't silently sitting
inside all of these right now, sniping out individual people, or perhaps
selling them off?  
 
This is what you should be fearful of, not us releasing things publicly,
but the fact that someone hasn't released something publicly.

student for the past 10+ months.  Rodrigo is from Curitiba, Parana, Brazil,
and turned 17 this May while living with us in Bement.
 
The decision to host a foreign exchange student was made almost on the spur
of the moment, and it turned into one of the most positive experiences my
family has had.  For this, all the credit is due to Rodrigo himself, as he
proved to be a bright, sensitive, and engaging young man, who I am sure is
destined for great success.

There is enormous inertia -- a tyranny of the status quo -- in private and
especially governmental arrangements.  Only a crisis -- actual or perceived
-- produces real change.  When that crisis occurs, the actions that are
taken depend on the ideas that are lying around.  That, I believe, is our
basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them
alive and available until the politically impossible becomes politically
inevitable.

I'd like to widen people's awareness of the tremendous timespan lying ahead
-- for our planet, and for life itself.  Most educated people are aware
that we're the outcome of nearly 4 billion years of Darwinian selection,
but many tend to think that humans are somehow the culmination.  Our sun,
however, is less than halfway through its lifespan.  Six billion years from
now, it will not be humans who watch the sun's demise.  Any creatures that
then exist will be as different from us as we are from bacteria or amoebae.

In July 2001 I subscribed to an on-line news digest created by a laid-off
news editor.  9/11 soon rolled around.  I archived the news digests from
that period.  Re-reading these gives me that visceral feeling of being in
the moment once again -- the confusion as to what happened, why it
happened, and what we should do about it ... the knee-jerk reactions, and
the slow shift to thoughtful reflection.
 
For the rest of this week and on Monday, I'm going to do a little 9/11
retrospective.  Some of you may find this interesting; others may wish to
skip it entirely, if it's too boring.  I hope you read it and reflect; I
believe there is real wisdom to be found here.

  BULLETIN: TERRORISTS ATTACK
  WORLD TRADE CENTER, PENTAGON 
 
Three hijacked passenger airliners, most likely under control of
terrorists, have crashed into and completely destroyed the twin towers of
the World Trade Center in New York City and damaged the Pentagon in
Washington, D.C.
 
At least one other hijacked airliner has also crashed, in the Pittsburgh
area, and another plane reportedly crashed near Camp David, Maryland.
 
Loss of life is estimated in the thousands in what is clearly the most
massive such attack on the U.S. in history. An estimated 50,000 people work
each day in the twin towers in Manhattan. Hospitals in New York City are
overwhelmed with the injured, many of them suffering from severe burns. All
of lower Manhattan was being evacuated.
 
Casualties and fatalities were reported at the Pentagon.
 
After the mid-morning attacks, all commercial air traffic in the United
States was shut down. Officials said service would not resume until at
least Wednesday morning, at the earliest.
 
President Bush made an early public statement describing the events as an
"apparent terrorist attack on our country."
 
Later, in Louisiana, he said democracy itself had been attacked. "Make no
mistake," Bush said. "The United States will hunt down and punish those
responsible for these cowardly attacks." All "appropriate security
measures" have been taken, he said, and the U.S. military worldwide is on
high alert status.
 
Stock markets were closed and trading halted.
 
Across the country, especially in larger cities, schools and government
offices were closed along with airports. The cable TV channels MTV, VHS1
and QVC suspended their operations and carried news feeds. Major league
baseball games were canceled.
 
The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Washington-based Islamic
advocacy group, and the American Muslim Political Coordination Council,
issued statements condemning "what are apparently vicious and cowardly acts
of terrorism against innocent civilians," saying that "no political cause
could ever by assisted by such immoral acts." The groups also advised that
"those who wear Islamic attire should consider staying out of public areas
for the immediate future."

  PASSENGERS CALLED HOME
  FROM DOOMED AIRLINERS
 
Several passengers aboard at least two of the four airliners hijacked by
terrorists on Tuesday managed to call home on their cell phones before
crashing, telling families of their love and giving brief but horrific
descriptions of what was happening in the air.
 
One woman, aboard the plane that was about to strike the second World Trade
Center tower in New York, learned via cellphone that a hijacked plane had
plowed into the first tower, and she was apparently able to relay that
information to other passengers before they, too, struck one of the twin
towers.
                
  ==================================================             
  SYMPATHY FROM CHINA: Xiaochun Li, our correspondent
  in China, sent this email message Wednesday morning:
  "I am very sorry to have heard about the attack on 
  the USA. I offer my  deepest sympathy! Could I 
  contribute my blood to the needy? Why human beings? 
  -- from a most, most, most common Chinese." 
  ===================================================
 
Two men -- Mark Bingham of California and Jeremy Glick of New Jersey -- who
were passengers on the plane that eventually crashed near Pittsburgh called
out on their cell phones, and both indicated that a group of passengers was
going to take action against the hijackers, The Washington Post reported.
 
Pennsylvania Rep. John Murtha said he believes a struggle took place in the
cockpit of United Airlines Flight 93 as the plane headed for a significant
target in Washington, D.C.
 
"There had to have been a struggle and someone heroically kept the plane
from heading to Washington," crashing it instead in rural Pennsylvania,
Murtha said.
 
One caller said the hijackers began killing stewardesses in the rear of the

plane to lure the pilots out of the cabin. Information from callers
indicated that the hijackers were armed with knives and box-cutters and
made bomb threats.
 
The Bush administration said Wednesday that "credible" security information
had indicated that the White House and Air Force One were both targets of
the well-planned attack -- explaining why President Bush delayed returning
to the White House on Tuesday. The plane that struck the Pentagon may have
been aimed at the White House, officials said.

Armed cops and FBI agents stormed the 36-story Westin Hotel in Boston on
Wednesday and arrested three people, after federal authorities linked them
to the credit card allegedly used to purchase tickets on the hijacked
flights, The Boston Globe said. However, FBI Director Robert Mueller later
said that no arrests in connection with the hijackings had yet been made.
Also searched was the Park Inn at Chestnut Hill, in a Boston suburb.
 
Boston newspapers said authorities had identified five Arab men as
suspects, and had found a rental car containing Arabic-language flight
training manuals at Boston's Logan International Airport, from which two of
the hijacked planes took off. According to the Boston Globe, investigators
found two bags, intended for one of the flights, containing a training
videotape for commercial airline pilots, a copy of the Koran, and a fuel
consumption calculator.
 
The FBI said Wednesday that four separate terrorist cells working together
had carried out the attack plans.
 
The Boston Herald said two of the suspects, brothers, entered the U.S. from
Canada. One was a trained pilot; both held passports from the United Arab
Emirates.
 
Saudi millionaire Osama bin Laden was most often mentioned as the suspected
head of the organization that carried out the attacks. A Pakistani
newspaper, however, reported Wednesday that bin Laden denied involvement,
saying, "The terrorist act is the action of some American group. I have
nothing to do with it."
 
In Afghanistan, where bin Laden is known to have stayed for lengthy
periods, the ruling Islamic fundamentalist Taliban party reportedly
disavowed any knowledge of the terrorist plan and asked the U.S.  not to
retaliate against the country.
 
Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the U.S. continued to search for survivors amid

the rubble -- in Manhattan, a five-story-high pile of concrete and twisted
metal -- and to try to absorb what had happened.
 
In a speech to the nation on Wednesday, President Bush said "the deliberate
and deadly attacks, which were carried out yesterday against our country,
were more than acts of terror. They were acts of war."
 
Casualty figures continued to grow. Some Officials estimated that as many
as 800 people may have died at the Pentagon crash site, but others put the
total at under 200. Though some Pentagon offices were open for business
early Wednesday morning, the complex was later evacuated as smoke from
burning embers continued to rise into the air.
 
In New York City, at least nine persons were rescued alive from the World
Trade Center rubble, and officials said a few more such rescues were still
likely. One man made repeated calls on his cell phone from beneath the
wreckage.

Hundreds were known dead, including at least 200 firefighters. New York
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani predicted the final death toll will be "a few
thousand people" in each building of the World Trade Center.
 
Commercial air traffic continued to be grounded for the second day in a
row, leaving thousands of travelers stranded. The Federal Aviation
Administration announced stringent new security procedures that must be
implemented at all airports before flights can be resumed. Curbside luggage
checking will be discontinued. No knives of any size, including tiny
pocketknives and the cutlery distributed with airline meals, will be
permitted.  Boarding areas will be restricted to ticketed passengers only.
 
Major League Baseball canceled its full schedule of games for the second
day in a row.
 
The New York Stock Exchange was closed again Wednesday. The last two-day

They said that all monuments were closed, but tourists ambled around the
famous Iwo Jima memorial in Arlington, Virginia. Still, the sight of large
groups of people crossing the bridge from the District of Columbia, and the
police closing the highway to the Pentagon, confirmed the crisis atmosphere
created by the crash of the American Airlines plane into the Pentagon and
the related sabotage-slaughter at the World Trade Center. At the nearby
Fort Myer facility, I walked past as bereted troops in fatigues inspected
each arrival.
 
Behind that, a plume of smoke came from one side of the headquarters of our
Defense Department.

Verbal bombs are following. Everyone is calling the terrorists "cowards" or
their actions "cowardly." Call it as you will: fanatic, evil, satanic,
dastardly; it was many things, but it was not cowardly. One person, perhaps
Orrin Hatch, has called them "cowards who would stop at nothing." The
shortsightedness of that comment is self-evident: it is the very opposite
of cowardice to be stoppable by nothing.
 
On the streets in Arlington an old white guy is saying how we need to close
the borders and keep the Muslims out. He lived in Saudi Arabia. I also
spent considerable time in the Middle East and I dont worry about Muslims,
just bad people who happen to be Muslims. (It also might be a good idea if
in the long run we got our own explosives out of the Middle East.) I fear
there will be a backlash against ethnic and religious groups by vigilantes
and mobs -- the same savage mentalities as the bombers themselves.
 
The media is fanning the flames of tyranny, trying to goad commentators to
say that we must now change our whole lives for the sake of security.
Rubbish. The people who tried to turn the Pentagon into the Square should
not be allowed to turn the free and the brave into slaves of fear. Let's
find the guilty and any sponsors and breathe fiery judgment. Let's solve
any underlying political issues that enable the guilty to circulate and
recruit.
 
From New York I learn that my brother who works for local TV is OK while
covering the event. My uncle used to work in the World Trade Center but
died a few years ago. Many people we know must at least know someone who
works there. It is conceivable that tens of thousands are dead. (I am not
an architect, but why should the whole building collapse when the top is
hit?)
 
I do agree the likely suspect is Osama bin-Laden.  The method is familiar
-- multiple attacks, no claim of responsibility, a level of intelligent
organization. The targets dealt with American world power and foreign power
which usually dont bother militia type groups. The fact that they chose the
Pentagon is revealing as well. Palestinians dont have much grudge against
the American military, but the Osama people do because of U.S. military
presence in Saudi Arabia.
 
Another questionable comment is that this is unprecedented in America. Not
really. The British occupied New York in the Revolution and the rebels
burned a good part of it. In the War of 1812, the British burned
Washington. In the Civil War, the Yankees burned Atlanta. As deliberate
targeting of civilians in American history goes, however, this is
nonetheless a doozy.
 
Find the guilty. Kill them, preferably after due process; punish their
sponsors. Don't be blaming religions and ethnic groups. Realize that they
are not cowards. Also realize that intentionally killing civilians is
nothing that odd for people at war: we razed Japan, killing hundreds of
thousands.
 
"There is no morality in war," is the quote of the American pilot who

York and Washington obviously feel the same.

  THE TRAGEDY - WHAT IT MEANT,
  WHAT IT CONTINUES TO MEAN
    
  REFLECTIONS AFTER TERRIBLE TUESDAY
           
  By JOHN DAVID POWELL 
  TMNS Contributor  
 
What happened on that terrible Tuesday, September 11, 2001, was a tragedy
that profoundly affected us all.  We stood motionless as we witnessed the
unthinkable become reality. We gasped as we saw twin towers crumble, and we
cried as we watched grown men weep.  And then we were drawn together, as
communities and as a nation, to seek a collective consolation from those
around us -- our families, our friends, our colleagues.
 
Theodore Roosevelt wrote that "Death is always, and under all
circumstances, a tragedy, for if it is not, then it means that life itself
has become one." The great calamity that struck our nation was much more
than death. It was a vicious act that struck at the heart of America and
touched the souls of each of her citizens.
 
Friday night my younger daughter and I lit candles and stood on the
sidewalk in front of our safe, suburban house. We joined a handful of

 
 
                         There's No Such Thing As Water

neighbors and became links in a remarkable chain of candle bearers that
stretched from sea to somber sea.
 
  * * *  
 
My daughter has not talked much about the attacks.  She was at a friend's
house that morning preparing for school pictures to be taken later in the
day. She saw the second jet crash into the second tower.
 
She developed a bad cold by Thursday and spent that day and the next at
home, watching the television coverage. She sat with me each night,
watching the events unfold. And still she did not talk about them.
 
Not until this week did the deep subconscious wounds bleed with
uncontrolled anger and frustration. And denial that anything was wrong. She
reminded me that she had seen bad things before. She remembers watching and
reading the news about Columbine High School, and she remembers witnessing
a schoolmate and a parent die as they were struck by a runaway bus at her
Albuquerque elementary school.
 
Her mother and I talked with her last night, explaining that it is not
unusual for a person to experience stress and anxiety months or years after
an event. It is hard to explain to a 12-year-old about post-traumatic
stress disorder.
 
  * * *  
 
I first learned of the attacks while talking on the telephone with my wife,
who was in Reno on business.  We were having our morning talk when she
uttered, "Oh, my god. A building is on fire in New York."
 
She soon became one of the thousands of people stranded when the planes
were grounded. By Wednesday morning, she was driving a rented car across
Nevada's high desert, en route to Salt Lake City.
 
She did not look forward to what she knew would be an ordeal at the airport
Sunday morning. She arrived five hours before her scheduled departure.
There was no one at the Southwest Airlines ticket counter, she said, but
the line for Delta "snaked through the terminal."
 
It took fifteen minutes to hand search her checked luggage. Security
personnel also rummaged through her purse and laptop computer bag looking
for knives, corkscrews and letter openers. None was found and she was
allowed through the security stop. As she walked to her gate, she passed a
gift shop that normally offers for sale souvenir knives, corkscrews and
letter openers. She didn't stop to see if those items were still being
offered. If so, the nation's airports have a few kinks to work out if
they're going to get this security thing to succeed.
 
  * * *  
 
News reports tell of long lines at airports for whatever flights remain.
For now, at least, impatient American travelers have traded their

irritation for some semblance of security. Airport inconvenience is a small
price to pay to be relatively assured you will reach your destination
safely.
 
One cannot be totally free and totally secure. It must be a Taoist thing:
"To be free is to be confined."
 
Freedom and security sit on opposite ends of a seesaw, teeter-tottering
with the needs of the nation.  If we are to be totally free, then we give
up all security. If we are to be totally secure, then we relinquish all of
our freedoms. If you need examples, just look at China, North Korea, Libya,
or a dozen other countries. When was the last time any of them suffered an
external terrorist attack? The people of those countries are totally
secure, but they have no freedoms.
 
What freedoms are the American people willing to give up to be secure? A
man from Arkansas, visiting Washington, D.C. on the day of the attacks,
noted that the terrorists win if we become a closed society. It can also be
said that terrorists will win if we remain an open society. I'm not sure
we've fully grasped the constitutional ramifications of Terrible Tuesday.
 
  * * * 
 
It has been interesting to note that the debate over religion has been set
aside while the nation seeks comfort and guidance. Children and their
teachers are praying in schools. The national day of mourning is led by
services in the National Cathedral. President Bush invokes the name of God
at every appearance. We had wrapped God in the flag, put them both in a
drawer, and allowed certain factions to lock them up and throw away the
key. And then came Terrible Tuesday. Americans broke the lock, displayed
the flag, and prayed to God for forgiveness and strength.
 
Some of us searched the old books for scriptures that would provide us
light and hope as we stumbled through darkness and fear. "He will swallow
up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all
faces," the prophet Isaiah assures us from across the millennia.
 
Like little children, we ask why. Then our children turn to us and ask the
same question. But the answer does not come.
 
And then I remember an old gospel song and try to find answers from its
words:
 
When death has found and taken our loved ones, Leaving our home so lonely
and drear, Then do we wonder why others prosper, Living so wicked year
after year. Farther along we'll know more about it. Farther along we'll
understand why. Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine. We'll
understand it all by and by.

A different type of fear came over the streets of Washington. On every
intersection of Georgetown, there were humvees and camouflage-clad military
people directing traffic. Some of these had "MP" written on their armbands.
 
Scary? Yes. But not simply for the danger these generally good-natured
folks were protecting us from.  It is scary in itself, of a different kind,
to see military on the street. It was still more bothersome when I could
spot a few places where they were not, but should have been.
 
It would have been nice to see fighters overhead on patrol. I saw none. But
there is no shortage of troops to direct the traffic and ordinary transport
in a relatively non-sensitive area. Military police, they were, rather than
ordinary police. Such a scene is a painful reminder that the enemy, in some
respects other than the physical destruction of life and property, has won
for a time.
 
Two words come to mind: Just barely. 
 
If they won it is only temporary and just barely. But "just barely" is also
a measure of how tolerable it is to have troops in the street, to have talk
of vague war against a concept (terrorism) rather than defined individuals
and states, and to hear repeatedly the medias sinister-sounding talk of
life "changed forever." The war against "Communism" should have been a war
against Soviet expansion, not a general crusade that meandered
destructively through Vietnam and various killing fields in Latin America,
where the evil "war on drugs" is helping decimate Colombia.
 
It is a brutal truth that relatively targeted preventive measures, and not
mass surveillance, could have worked last week. Cockpits inaccessible to
passengers. Aircraft on patrol rather than on call to "scramble" over our
key cities. FBI "watch" alerts that the Immigration and Naturalization
Service pays attention to. We dont need to sacrifice everything, despite
the insidious talk of life changing forever.
 
Should we be on a war footing? No question. But war brings intrusive
measures that tend to overstay:  income tax withholding, military drafts,
and elusive health insurance tied to employment are lesser historic
examples. We should cooperate, but not accept measures that require
permanent surrender of our American-ness or even permanent surrender of
common sense. The talk of expanding surveillance powers, of unprecedented
secrecy and press restrictions, is ominous -- perhaps necessary, and then
again, perhaps not.
 
In short, should we tolerate the increased security presence everywhere?
Yes. Should we give the benefit of the doubt to intrusive and secret steps
underway?  Probably. But if so, we should accept it with an eye on what it
means to be American. And therefore we should do accept it in the following
manner:
 
Just barely.

recognizing that the war on terrorism cannot be won by waging war.  We
must, of course, protect our security; but we must also correct the
grievances on which terrorism feeds.  Crime requires police work, not
military action.

There is nobody in this country who got rich on his own.  You built a
factory out there?  Good for you.  But I want to be clear: you moved your
goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for; you hired workers the
rest of us paid to educate; you were safe in your factory because of police
forces and fire forces that the rest of us paid for.  You didn't have to
worry that marauding bands would come and seize everything at your factory,

and hire someone to protect against this, because of the work the rest of
us did.

great idea?  God bless.  Keep a big hunk of it.  But part of the underlying

Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever
encountered to help me make the big choices in life.  Because almost
everything -- all external expectations, all pride, all fear of
embarrassment or failure -- these things just fall away in the face of
death, leaving only what is truly important.  Remembering that you are
going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have
something to lose.  You are already naked.  There is no reason not to
follow your heart.

My wealth has come from a combination of living in America, some lucky
genes, and compound interest.  Both my children and I won what I call the
ovarian lottery.  (For starters, the odds against my 1930 birth taking
place in the U.S. were at least 30 to 1.  My being male and white also
removed huge obstacles that a majority of Americans then faced.)
 
My luck was accentuated by my living in a market system that sometimes
produces distorted results, though overall it serves our country well.
I've worked in an economy that rewards someone who saves the lives of
others on a battlefield with a medal, rewards a great teacher with
thank-you notes from parents, but rewards those who can detect the
mispricing of securities with sums reaching into the billions.  In short,
fate's distribution of long straws is wildly capricious.

When the modern corporation acquires power over markets, power in the
community, power over the state and power over belief, it is a political
instrument, different in degree but not in kind from the state itself.  To
hold otherwise -- to deny the political character of the modern corporation
-- is not merely to avoid the reality.  It is to disguise the reality.  The
victims of that disguise are the students who instruct in error.  Let there
be no question: economics, so long as it is thus taught, becomes, however
unconsciously, a part of the arrangement by which the citizen or student is
kept from seeing how he or she is, or will be, governed.

I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various
species on the planet.  The condor used the least energy to move a
kilometer.  Humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing about a third
of the way down the list. ... then someone at Scientific American had the
insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle, [who]
blew the condor away.  That's what a computer is to me... the most
remarkable tool that we've ever come up with.  It's the equivalent of a
bicycle for our minds.

my personal opposition to the death penalty.  I was torn between my
personal convictions about the morality of capital punishment and my oath
to uphold the Oregon constitution.
 
They were the most agonizing and difficult decisions I have made as
Governor and I have revisited and questioned them over and over again
during the past 14 years.  I do not believe that those executions made us
safer; and certainly they did not make us nobler as a society.
 
... I refuse to be a part of this compromised and inequitable system any
longer; and I will not allow further executions while I am Governor.

[The Court] is required, even after giving substantial deference to the
views of the administrative agency, to be satisfied that it is not being
used as a tool to enforce an agreement that is unfair, unreasonable,
inadequate, or in contravention of the public interest. ...  Applying these
standards to the case in hand, the Court concludes, regretfully, that the
proposed Consent Judgment is neither fair, nor reasonable, nor adequate,
nor in the public interest. ...
 
As for common experience, a consent judgment that does not involve any
admissions and that results in only very modest penalties is just as
frequently viewed, particularly in the business community, as a cost of
doing business imposed by having to maintain a working relationship with a
regulatory agency ....  If the allegations of the Complaint are true, this
is a very good deal for Citigroup; and, even if they are untrue, it is a
mild and modest cost of doing business.

It is my belief that the writer, the free-lance author, should be and must
be a critic of the society in which he lives.  It is easy enough, and
always profitable, to rail away at national enemies beyond the sea, at
foreign powers beyond our borders who question the prevailing order.  But
the moral duty of the free writer is to begin his work at home; to be a
critic of his own community, his own country, his own culture.  If the
writer is unwilling to fill this part, then the writer should abandon
pretense and find another line of work: become a shoe repairman, a brain
surgeon, a janitor, a cowboy, a nuclear physicist, a bus driver.
