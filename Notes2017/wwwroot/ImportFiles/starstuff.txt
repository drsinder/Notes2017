<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the Voyager space probes <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6151/1158.summary">plunge into the inky cosmic void</a>, each carries a golden record with 27 songs ranging from Mozart to Chuck Berry. Now, with help from a musical physicist, the twin space probes boast a song of their own. Each craft carries a cosmic ray detector snapping hourly measurements of the number of protons whirring past them. Over the last 37 years, the probes recorded more than 320,000 such measurements. Domenico Vicinanza, a musician with a Ph.D. in physics, mapped each value with a corresponding note on the musical range, with larger counts corresponding to higher notes. Stringing and mixing the notes together, Vicinanza assembled the spacecraft&rsquo;s musical score. In the song, Voyager 1 plays the piano while Voyager 2 accompanies on the string instruments. Each overlapping note during the song corresponds to the spacecraft simultaneously measuring cosmic rays while soaring through space billions of miles apart. While Vicinanza admits he composed the musical arrangement purely as a fun way to present the Voyager mission data, he says transforming data sets into music in this way can help scientists recognize trends and patterns they might otherwise miss. And that makes for music that&rsquo;s definitely out of this world.</p>

<p>An astronomer and amateur musician has coaxed a haunting melody from a star's distinctive twinkle.</p>
<p>The twinkling star is one of two in a binary system called Y Cam whose two stars orbit very close together. The pulsing frequencies that Y Cam A beams toward Earth form the basis of the chords and musical scale used in the composition.</p>
<p>Burak Ulaş, an astronomer at the Izmir Turk College Planetarium in Turkey, started the project after finding, in an earlier study, that the star Y Cam A's vibrations closely match a particular, unusual musical scale. Out of 28 stars, matching with 57 musical scales, Y Cam A's vibrations came closest to the intervals in a real-life scale.

<p>"Think of that: This star oscillates in a musical scale that we listen [to] in some songs in the world," Ulaş told Space.com. "Fascinating!"</p>

<p>As you can see you are on solid ground for making music from any kind of data.</p>
<p>I think one of the challenges will be to find progressively more complex and interesting plausible ways to gather the data.&nbsp; One might start with something one dimensional like a picket fence like structure with sensors of some kind behind the open spaces.&nbsp; These might be simply mapped to keys on a keyboard (piano?).&nbsp; Would not make for very interesting music initially perhaps.&nbsp; Perhaps then then a cylinder, barrel, or disk with holes (mask and sensors) are formed and rotated like you spoke of yesterday on the phone.&nbsp; Then maybe up to a sphere with holes of various sizes and shapes that rotates around multiple axes.&nbsp; Working then maybe on up to video that gets processed by areas as you spoke of.&nbsp; Once you get into video the processing possibilities go up dramatically.&nbsp; The final discovery might be made using a radio telescope which our character wins a grant to use to collect data.&nbsp; These various apperatus and detectors are for the more visual and tactilely comfortable in the audience.&nbsp; For others the computational aspects may hold more interest.&nbsp; Then of course there is the increasingly interesting music.</p>
