The trouble started on Friday December 19 at 10pm
after the system was reloaded.  All our lessons
were working fine until that moment.  They worked
again on Saturday morning December 20.  They have
not been working since the system came back up on
Wednesady.
When we condense our lessons, with the present PLATO
version, answerc is flagged as a condense error.

The problem is with "font-acc-0-acc-font" and
"font-acc-1-acc-font" (which autobackspace accent marks).
Other combinations seem ok,  We're looking into where the
trouble lies and we will try to fix as soon as possible.

The 12 january 1976 issue of TIME carries an article with
an overall favorable view of Bertrand Russell, perhaps the
best example of humanity in the 20th century, though not
respectable in the eyes of the mass media in the United
States. Even as late as his death in 1970,  TIME found it
necessary to label his anti-Vietnam war activities as
obsessively anti-American,  although this view is considered
to be simply good sense today.  Russell had a stubbornness
that made him a real pain in the ass to those easily
upset by differences of opinion.  In retrospect,  it is clear
that the "loyal opposition" role Russell often assumed is
most valuable, It tool TIME 75 years, but they finally
got the message.  Professor Ian mitroff would argue
that an information system should provoke strong conflict
if possible in order to bring out the full range of
policy options

available to a decision maker.  He cautions, however, that
those not trained in thinking in terms of "dialectics"
(strong opposing viewpoints) do not benefit from this
interaction and are even hostile to it.  There seems to
be an inherent.  irrational human disposition against
being able to think in this fashion, regardless of the
merits, thus explaining Russell's troubles with the
American press, as well as some of the exchanges in
NOTES.  I suggest that when the system is revised,
a "dialectic" category be added and reserved for 
controversal discussions in NOTES.  Before entering,
an explanation of this process would be given and a
warning to those with weak intellectual stomaches
to stay away.

Since most strongly hostile notes seem to function more as
therapy for the writer then as constructive dialog, perhaps
your proposed note category should be write-only.

I agree completely with this suggestion.  As Plato moves
beyond the experimental stage some very hard questions
need to be thoroughly discussed and no present forum
seems available.

By the way,  Mr.Carter, why is Time's claimed vociferous
opposition to Russell in the face of strongly held views
in his favor not an example of dialectic?  You seem to
lambaste Time on the one hand for strongly defending its
views but you cry on the other hand in favor of precisely
such staunch viewpoints.

---------- response  5

  01/09     19.12     carter       comm

John, I think the difference is the nature of the argument.
Russell's arguments,  while passionate (in order to make
a more affective case)  were always of a rational nature.
The response by the American press was always something
like "that anit-American Briton" or "an eccentric old
British Earl".  My study of the exchanges during the
Sixties indicates there was rarely an intellectual response
to Russell's charges.  The worst example I have come across
is the editorial the Chicago Tribune ran after his death.
One of their main objections was their contention that
some obscure aide of Russell's had sex with an animal.  For
a major American newspaper to print something like that is
nearly unbelievable.  My concern is to influence the design
of computer-based media to encourage dialogue of a higher
level.  Russell's interaction with the the American
press is a fascinating case.

You mean that the point of all this esoteric jazz about
dialectics and the life of Bertrand Russell is that
we should avoid character assassination?

 ---------- response 8

  01/10     12.39     carter       comm

No, not exactly.  The point is that any serious designer
of an information system should consider the following:

1 The information system should provide the alternatives
considered by a decision maker.  Without these alter-
natives clearly specified, any decision is likely to 
be impoverished.
2 One of the best ways to generate these alternatives is
through intellectual conflict.
3)But, most people haven't studied Hegel, and have a
natural disposition against objective idealism which
is the philosophic basis of this process.
4) So, the question is how do you encourage the thesis-
antithesis process which produces the necessary
alternatives.
5) In that traditional media do a poor job of this, can a
computer-based media do any better?  I think it can
by separating the discussions and providing a training
program for the dialectic notes.

The larger question posed by all of this is whether it is
possible to produce high quality hardware/software while
at the same time investigating various other dimensions,
whether they be psychological, philosophic etc that many
have a major impact on the effectiveness of your system.
The generally high quality of the plato system software
is most likely due to the careful review it receives before
being released.  Whether it is possible to subject the
function of the software to the same sort of review the
code itself receives is still an open question.  When I
am engaged writing software if someone comes up and
inquires whether I have considered some larger consideration
my first reaction is to drop the plasma panel on their foot.

If, as Mr, Carter suggests, a dialectic forum is suited
only for those with strong "intellectual" lives (and other
organs) the method seems totally unsuited for Plato IV.
Since, as has always been my understanding, this system is
designed for the general mass of non-intelluctually inclined
plebians in our society in addition to those philosophers
like Mr.Carter.  If this is truly to be an open system
then an open and reasonable means of discussion must be 
found that is suitable to at least the majority of the 
Plato population.
    I have read philosophers who used the dialectic
method to get their point across and I have found that they
are not always as reasoable as those who have used other
methods (as Mr.Neitzche said to Mr.Hegel).
    If, on the other hand, Mr. Carter's aim was to
praise Bertrand Russell (as I suspect it was) then this

---------- response 11

  01/12     10.20     ken       cornell

was not the proper forum for it.  It was my understanding
that notes containing such strong political views as those
expressed by Mr. Carter in his overwhelming love affair
with Russell were taboo in General Notes.

---------- response 12
  01/12     14.42     bowery       comm

Are philosophical view-points then banned?

---------- response 13

  01/13     10.21     ken       cornell

Bowery, that is not the point.  Mr. Carter was not argueing
from a philosophical point of view but from a political one.
I feel that such statements, as Mr.  Carter's claiming that
opposition to the Vietnam war is simply a matter of common
sense, are, not only incorrect, but also of a highly
political and controvesial nature.Thus, they have no place
in General Notes.
   However, unless the question deals directly with
some philosophical aspect of the PLATO IV System (such as
how we can insult a great man by naming a computor program
after him) I see little, if any, reason for them to appear
in General Notes, Such things belong in Mr. Carter's own
lesson -discuss-.

Mr. Carter:
     Although I most definitely agree with you about the
need for a computer-based forum for higher-level
discussions, I am also inclined to agree with judy about
the relationship between Hegalian dialectics and a
relativist view of reality.  Your statement about
justice Douglas did not answer her objection.
---------- response 17

It would be nice if we could get a straight answer out of
Mr. Carter in re to my response on dialectical methods.
And, in addition I reccomend that Mr.Carter read
"Freedm, Virtue and the First Amendment by Walter Burns
and then let's see what you think about that "great
American" Justice William <. Douglas.

  01/09     14.00     meers       wright

Is there any plans for the system router to keep track
of the time spent in each lesson by each student regardless
of whether the student 'completed' the lesson?

  Two places where a time in minutes would be useful is
where a student spends time in a lesson but does not finish,
and where a 'smart' student uses TERM-end or whatever to
obtain credit without going through the lesson.  Time
appears to be  a more real  progress indicator than asterisks
although asterisks are still neccessary.

  The time could be shown in the same format as the pages
that show -scores and lessons completed- available from
course statistics.

---------- response 1

  01/19     15.11     fay       rtv362

I think that keeping track of the time spent in each
lesson would indeed be a useful addition to the system
router (given that there is somewhere to store all that
information in rvars). As they say  "one vote for", altho
at this point I would tend to regard such a feature as
more of a luxury than a necessity.

---------- response 2

  01/10     14.24     b sherwood       s

There are real technical difficulties in keeping track of
such information. There are even bigger difficulties
using such information . You almost imply that the longer
the student stays in the lesson the more or better work he
has done.  In fact, long lesson times may merely reflect
that the student reads slowly or daydreams a lot.  The
present emphasis hopefully will impel authors to write
meaningful completion criteria.
---------- response 3

  01/10     14.33     b sherwood       s

More specifically, the "smart student who jumps to the
end" should be taken care of by the author, in not putting
such silly completion facilities in the lesson,  And it
might be useful to show that a student has LOOKED at a
lesson,  even tho he hasn't completed it, and this info
can more easily be stored and be more easily interpreted.

I think that most of these problems should be faced by the
author, and that instructors using lessons which do not 
do something reasonable about completion credit should put
pressure on the authors to upgrade the material.

(In the spirit of demonstrating that PLATO speaks not with
a monolithic tongue....)

While I admit that there are very real difficulties in both
implementing such measures and interpreting their results,
the fact that time in a lesson represents an expenditure of
resources that could be used elsewhere seems to make time
measures of substantial value for instructional management
if nothing else.  Al Avner

But for scheduling/allocating terminal time, isn't total
time more pertinent?  And that we have in the student's
record already.

---------- response 6

  01/11     08.46     john r       reading

The fact that a student may spend substantial time in a 
lesson without completing it is indeed an important
measure in some cases:  to the instructor it can indicate
that the lesson was too hard and should have been
prescribed in a different sequence.

---------- response 7

  01/11     10.49     fay       o
In any event, if the measure is really important to a sub-
group of instructors/authors, the info can be stored easily
enough in student vars. Also, we have facilities for
dumping virtually the same info into a datafile.

In fact the datafile _can_ store score, completion, and time
(area and lesson) info, although some modifications need
to be made to make this info more readable.

  01/11     13.06     bonnie       matha

If the system can find the space to keep a little more
information on each lesson in the system router, I'd prefer
to see this used by the lesson in any way the author wishes.
One group could use it to keep track of total time in
each lesson.

Other groups could use it differently: I'd like to use it
to keep data specific to each lesson that would route the
student within the lesson each time he enters. Then each
lesson could restart the student appropriately.

There are many other ways that a data area for each lesson
in the system router could be used.

---------- response 9

  01/11     18.56     siegel       peer

The educational research literature indicates that "time
on task" correlates highly with mastery of skills. Or to
put it another way, "the more time you spend with a
particular subject, the more you are likely to learn it"
(in a correlational sense).

Although a student may pass the author's criteria for
completion, the student who reviews the lesson several
times _may_ get more out of the lesson than the student who
goes through it once, Time spent in each lesson
is an important piece of information when used with
other variables.

More consideration should be given to adding this
variable to the system router.

The asterisk notation for completing a lesson has always
bothered me. It may present a false signal to the student,
namely, "the computer judges that I have completed this
lesson--therefore, why go back and review?"

The author also has to use the standard explanation
of the asterisk found on the HELP pages of the router.

Keeping time spent in lessons in course records would be
a VERY valuable feature.
  Although the time can be determined by
using student variables, using datafiles, datasets,etc.,
in the Community College Plato project, the lesson used
have been programmed by many different authors and are
used at a number of sites, The problems involved in
monitoring, describing, and analyzing the Plato usage
under these circumstances are monumental. Lesson completion
information is important, but at this point, time spent
in lessons is at least as important data to use in
describing and analysing the implementation of Plato
in this varied and complex usage situation.

---------- response 12

  01/12     15.19     gilpin       peer

It is important to all of PLATO's constituencies that
lessons teach quickly as well as effectively. Although,
as Bruce points out, time-in-lesson data is always difficult
to interpret, having it available is the first step to
understanding it and eventually minimizing it. If
time-in-lesson is made automatically available, it will
be widely recorded, reported, and attended to. This kind
of consistent attention can only be beneficial. It would
seem worth encouraging.

     Although this type of information is readily available
to curriculum coordinators, and those who collect student
area data, these parameters (in area form) are rarely shown
to teachers, who struggle with instructor sign-ons and its
multitude of options. I have found that in my contacts
with about two dozen chemistry teachers last semester, that
many would rather have a number in the curriculum stat-
istics section, which would indicate either 1) the number
of hours a student spent in each lesson, or 2) the fract-
ional portion of that lesson which the student completed,
rather than merely an *, if the student finished it.
(Albeit that some of this information would not be as
indicative as one may want.) The TEACHERS want it.
     In many classes, it is typical, that a student will
spend a large amount of time in a lesson, but never finish
it, thus never obtain the * (¬+ receive credit for it).

This suggestion was inspired by the minor problem in
help notes ¬$618 (I apologize if this sounded degrading of
the problem, but I compare it to those lists that systems
people mention about "things to be done". My solution
to the problem in the note is also of minor priority.)

      The note mentioned errors occurring that .might.
have occurred due to hidden characters. This has
happenned to me and I'm sure others. The .H. option
is excellent. What I suggest is an extension of the
.H. option. An indication at the beginning of the line
of code in the editor that includes hidden chars. would
alert unsuspecting authors to finger and parity slips.
    Now, I don't know exactly how the lines would be
checked, but it seems possible. However it may be too
costly in space and time.
      The indicator could be simple, such as a period...
?ˆ?ˆe.g.????==.4 write _Here_ =.

Such a feature would be too costly in terms of time to be
done all the time. Perhaps an author would be able to select
whether or not he wishes lines with hidden chars to be
marked, with the default being that they wouldnt be marked.

then to search for it) could be very useful.

A few changes to the SS feature in the editor:

The status information has been extended to include a guess
of how many words your source code will take as well as
how many words in the source block are available to use.

HELP has been changed so that a quick reference chart
is displayed on the display page. This is so that you
don't have to wade through the help lesson to look up
much-used commands. If you press HELP again, you will
be sent to the help lesson.

-rdraw- commands now can be processed using SS. Also,
commands have been added to convert from draws to rdraws
and back.

A special options index has been included for other new
commands. By pressing SHIFT-HELP, you can perform functions
such as loading a charset or micro, destroying the entire
display and converting all rdraws to draws.

Also, STEP MODE has been taken out in favor of a new
LOCATE function. By pressing LAB, the cursor will cycle
through all the reference points for each object on the
screen. SHIFT-LAB will advance the cursor 5 steps.

Things that are coming in the near future:

The ability to scale the display larger or smaller
and the ability to rotate the entire display around a
point. Also, new commands are coming that will allow
the user to edit text paragraphs, with the ability to
move around and edit sentences within a paragraph.

Thanks for the new service, Tim. The new service is an
amazing help in creating and editing displays. The short
HELP display should get even the more impatient people to
discover the fine options that are available to us. I was
one of those people who overlooked the SS option because it
was (past tense) too complicated, but after having seen the
options that are available, I am a convert to service now.
Have a look, people, there's a lot of good material there.

the need for an arrow, but permit ONLY touch input.

Now if I have an animation proceed only by touching an
exact square, and use an arrow, any response by the
user is "ok"ed plus the animation proceeds. This could
be confusing in that the user may eroneously think that
the "supersticious" keyset response is also needed.
(even if nookno is used, the response may be considered
essential as the "ok" would then be the extension of the
animation.

People are working on the -touch- commands. I believe
that right now the work is in the "thinking" stage--what
additional stuff is needed, how should present touch
capacities be extended and modified, etc.

Even now, the user who is asked to "touch here" should be
completely unaware of the underlying structure of the			
program. I would expect you to have something like this:
inhibit arrow
arrow   3201
enable
specs   nookno
touch   2305,4,1
disable
endarrow
do      animation

If you are doing lots of -touch-es, it is probably easier
just to set -okword (blank tag)- and -nowore (blank tag)-
than to remember -specs nookno- each time.

I was in aids checking on specs while working on touch
commands. I was having trouble in the placement of the
specs in relation to the touch and enable command. I got
to the option c from the data-specs page and the
touch was not included in the table of which specs tags
affect which judging commands in what way.

This is just to suggest that it should probably be inserted.
(Unless if I missed it, but I don't think so.)

Enable is a regular command and should normally be placed
after the arrow (because the arrow disables the panel) and
before the first judging command.

When the panel is enabled a touch input has the same effect
as the next key and initiates judging, so specs will not
change the action of the touch commands if they are
executed.

It has long been known that $$ removes preceding spaces

The *ed lines will not be condensed nor will they affect
the continuation of the -write-. For a classy look, you
can always use ACCESS?SHIFT-SUP,represented here by ¬W=¬D=¬X
This superimposes a line on the one above, like this,

Now that I think about it, I am curious why you don't use
the two argument erase command rather than "about 200"
lines of blank spaces. Surely such a substitution would
be more readable and take less space. The erase will work
even in mode rewrite. You can overwrite some text and then
erase old text below your new lines.

My opinion, unsolicited, is that you are attacking the
wrong problem.

   Maybe this unit may be of use to you. Once executed it
makes font(space) a visible character. Of course you have
precede all of your trailing spaces with a font. After you
are done editing, loading any normal charset will make
font(space) invisible once more. For 200 occurences this
should be cheaper in space than $$ and more legible.

If you'll read it again, walter, you'll notice that

And before Warner comes up with a variable-length erase

Ok, one last time. I agree that a delimiter such as
originally discussed could have some value. However, for
simple clearing of text, (variable length or not) use of
the erase command is much clearer than a line or lines of
blank spaces. The existing -erase- is easily specified,
uses only moderate space, can do blocks with the two arg.
version, and best of all is understandable at a glance for
the documentation.
        My own use of such a delimiter, ::, would be kept to
lines containing text and ending with the spaces, not just
blank lines. In that context :: may be handy.

ahasic's method may also require loading a non-blank
character into position 64. There are two "blank"s in
the altfont memory (and also two in the regular memory.)
By having one in each block of character memory, it is
unnecessary to send the "change of memory block" info to
the terminal to write a blank. The one used depends upon
which memory block -- upper case or lower case -- preceded
it.

There were problems with the copy-a-block option and

Well, as popular rumor over here at CERL has it, the systems

keep the extra space around until and unless they are
absolutely sure they are not going to need it. Gad! what a
mess if they shortened it and then decided they needed it

  At Cornell we had a problem. We wanted to make PLATO
available to anyone for educational purposes, but people
were making use of it as a free electronic pinball machine.
The numerous lessons with jumpouts ot games thwarted our
list of games, and it would be difficult to keep up with
every new jumpout.
   Our answer to this problem is a new router that DETECTS
JUMPOUTS to lessons on the restriction (game) list. The
lesson jumped to is stored in common. When the student
returns, a fromnum tells whether he has returned from a
prohibited lesson. When the student next enters the index,
if he has returned from a prohibited lesson, the lesson he
had jumped to originally (that must have had a jumpout) is
added to the leslist.

Qume as two possible (OEM) suppliers of acceptable machines.

We expect to use a microprocessor printer controller

cessor. Thus, all of the printer-dependent decisions
that whatever system support is developed for hardcopy
printers does not need to know the details or identity

Dear Abby,
  I don't know if this has been brought up before, but I
find it rather interesting. DID YOU KNOW THAT:
        If you go into a lesson and edit common
        then back out, you will not leave _ANY_
        "fingerprints". In other words, if some-
        one else edits my common, and does nothing
        else, I WON'T KNOW ABOUT IT!!!! Please do
        something to correct this situation.

   What Marshall is saying is that if the person editting
common has the codeword to do it, then it's a simple matter 
to go into another lesson space and setup a common editor
there, thereby editting common remotely, but getting the
exact same results. In other woids, you never have to
edit the lesson to edit common. It's two different things.

What if you are running students in a lesson that uses
common to collect statistics or notes or something? Do
you really want the signon of the last person (to enter
newsreport, for example)?

Look.....
  What I'm talking about is that if someone else finds
your change code, and changes your code, you know about
it, but if they change only the common, no one knows
about it. What I would like to have implemented is a
better common security system, for instance, a command
that will specify which lessons can use common. Right
now it's up for grabs, and any common is fair game to
any pervert on the system!!

Yes, having the system common editor update the last
change information is planned, but has no great priority.
Since, as Marshall mentioned, knowing the common codeword
would allow him to edit the common without leaving any
trace anyway.

Excuse me;
       Why wouldn't it leave a trace? If someone has your
_change_ code and edits your lesson, it leaves a trace. Why
should just having the common code word excuse this when
their are editting your common?

There is a good general security mechanism discussed with
good references and examples (including the example of a
general NOTES type system) in the current (Oct 1975)
issue of the quarterly journal _Software_ _Practice_ _and_
_Experience_.

The machanism disccussed could be used to
manage all of the PLATO security and add extra features
also, but as that kind of change would involve rewriting
of almost everything, the paper is probably best treated 
as a discussion of what is possible in the way of general
security mechanisms (as opposed to evolutionary hodge-podge
systems such as on PLATO or worse yet on the IBM 360).

Example: 
Your lesson is "abc".
The common code is 'common'.
You have a one block common called "mycommon".

I wish to mess up your common.
I have a lesson called "xyz".
I go into lesson "xyz" and put on a common code of 'common'.
I then insert a common command -common abc,mycommon,322-
and then calc nc1?"messed up".

Indeed the common has been tampered with.

Any one knowing your codeword may do so.

The implied suggestion appears to be that some section of
system code should be added to the comloading machinery that
would potentially update a reserved portion of the common
with the last user info EVERY TIMESLICE.

Urk.

Be more secretive with your lesson codes instead.

---------- response 12
  
  01/14     21.53     fay       o

I agree that it would be preposterous to update the "last
edited by" every timeslice. Also, if the perpetrator of
this scheme (directly or indirectly) thinks about it a
second, the "last changed by" info would be virtually
meaningless in any situation where the common was being
used by running students, or by other users of an author's
lesson. What would be more feasible would be changing the 
LESSON "last changed by" info IF someone (as with source)
edited the common directly, ie, entered the common block
from the block directory page in said lesson and did his/her
thing (like "messing on your bits"). Changing the common
codeword will, as pointed out, guarantee that "perverts"
cannot willy nilly change your common in lessons whose
common codewords do not match.

A related problem: if you go into a lesson, convert a block
to common, edit the common, and then convert back to source,
there is no evidence that the block has been edited,
although the last edited information on the data page seems
to be updated properly.

---------- response 15

  01/15     01.47     fritz       ames

  I believe Tim is the only one who understood what resch
meant. Obviously we can't have "last edited" changed
whenever ANY lesson changes the common (I agree with
Gray... Urk!). This would only happen if the person
finds out your common code, and how often does that
happen? (How often do you type your common code for 
wayward eyes to see as opposed to your change code?) 
It is, however, completely reasonable to expect the
systems common editor to update this information
when someone zeroes, transfers, or otherwise perverts
your common. It would only require a few strategically
placed checks which, as Larry said, are easy to
implement.

  01/15     01.47     daleske       ames
The repliers to the previous note about changing common
without having the last-edited information being updated
seem to be reading only what they wish to read. (to those
logicians in the crowd, I will include myself as a possible
case).

To find out a lesson's change-code (among other methods),
        one needs to enter statistically possible patterns
        for a match test at the Author Mode arrow to have
        the patterns rejected until the correct code is
        obtained. (which has been done here!)
To find out a lesson's common-code, one must enter possible
        patterns in the common-code of one's own lesson (on
        the page reached via DATA from the block display
        page) AND condense the lesson to have the possible
        code rejected by condense-error until the correct
        code is obtained.
(contd)

---------- response 1

  01/15     02.08     daleske       ames

(cont'd from main note)
THUS, it is MUCH more difficult to find out the common-code
        by this method due to the deterrent of waiting in
        the condense queue.

NOW, the Mischevious-person ("M") discovers the common-code.
        Under present system policy, "M" may do many minor
        nasties that drive people insane (example: RS)
        "M" will never be found out.

IT IS obvious that common may be changed via another lesson
        when "M" knows the common-code. This case is un-
        voidable. The persons that assumed the last-edited
        records were meant to be updated every timeslice
        by any lesson using the common, were missing the
        point that the last-edited records need to be up-
        dated WHENEVER a change via system editor occurs.
        The author is then left a secure base to apply
(contd)

---------- response 2

  01/15     05.36     daleske       ames

(cont'd from main note and reply)
        further security within the lesson. Ex: editing that
        neccessarily be accomplished while in student-mode.
        (such as a set of complicated linked-list edits or
        other hair-raisers).

THEREFORE, it is a must that the present system policy be
        changed to provide the necessary information to the
        author as there do exist "M"'s on the system and
        they have accomplished the above (I know this from
        personal experience with an "M" that has perforce
        been found out in other lesson changing/stealing
        cases).
The reply that mentioned the system was a patchwork was in
        part probably correct. However, a change in one
        policy might have allowed this problem to appear
        and go long unnoticed. (remember only 2 lessoncodes)

  You ignore the fact that the common code is not needed

to the trouble you mentioned to obtain the common code.
Of course the change code, properly guarded, is still hard

Since any "s" record in the hands of a knowledgeable person

all blatant traces of the tampering, file integrity on PLATO

Thanks much for explaining what I meant.
  With the "easier to get" change code, anyone can get
  in and do nasties, without leaving any trace of his
  entry. It seems to me that if the change code is not
  trusted enough to do well enough alone, but needs a
  "fingerprint leaver" in the systems editor, that it
  should leave the same in the common and leslist
  editors.

      I think we are slowly going towards a security
system not involving codewords, but rather name, course,
and lesson name. Thus, a common could specify which lessons
could access it, or a lesson could specify which persons
may edit it.
      This system is very secure, but breaks down quite
drastically if a person discovers another persons password.

The main problem with that type of security system is that
the database to be protected oft times becomes dwarfed by
the humongous dataset controlling access. And then, what
people are allowed to access the controlling dataset?

for a small change to the charset editor.
Under option 6 ( copy from another charset ) on the page

very helpful if the charset and the file names of the

   Yes. It was my impression that semicolons were only
used in TUTOR when there were sub-units in a command tag,
like the new -datain- and -dataout- commands, that required
delimiting: datain 1;s,1;2. To change _that_ would be even
more confusing!

With respect to the two previous responses:

Yes, I understand that the semicolon is needed to 
delineate fields when the fields contain more
than one argument. Of the 14 commands listed
in the original note, none have fields which
require more than one argument. The draw command
and datain/dataout commands were not mentioned.

This is inefficient...
    How about giving the type (using the same codes

      It seems to me what's needed in PLATO or at least
in the operating system under which PLATO runs, is to
utilize the Virtual Machine concept. That way, experi-
mental versions of PLATO (any number of them) could be
run to the system programmers' hearts' content while
_simultaneously_ on another virtual machine on the _same_
_real_ _machine_. a tried and true version of PLATO could be
run in a standard production mode.
     Think of it! Twenty-four hours a day of prime time!
_AND_ twenty-four hours a day of PLATO testing time!

     (Now I suppose I'm going to get a whole flock
of responses from system programmers--both U=?I and CDC--
telling me how ridiculous this idea is; but after all,
IBM uses it; _I_ think it works ok; and can't CDC do as well?)

For you inexperiened VM/370 users,VM/370,if propery tuned
and running OS/VS1 4.0 with handshaking features, operates
the OS/VS1 virtual machine environment better than OS/VS1
in a native machine. Paging is _not_ a bad way of doing
machine swapping. YSU has been running VM/370 for a year
and a half and we have no intentions of abandoning it.

One of the most basic assumptions or requirements of
TUTOR is that response time should be _FAST_. Do you
realize that each keypress--each letter which you type--
is examined before being echoed to the screen? And,
interestingly, system statistics show that every other
keypress requires more action than mere echoing. I.e.,
it requires branching, judging, lookup in a micro table,
etc.
The fast response time requires very short timeslices
(25 milliseconds).
The thought of trying to swap the entire "language"
in and out every 25 milliseconds frightens me silly.

without looking at your particular example...the problem
here is that we don't save enough status concerning the
arrow at the system level...for example, we don't save the
left-screen margin as set by the arrow so that when you
judge, do a dataop, then the system tries to erase the
judgement mark-up BUT has an improper left-margin due to
the user changing the "arrow" margin via an -at- command
in the dataop. Many problems of this nature exist...like
we also need to save the terminal mode at the arrow for
similar reasons. And also the font, etc!!!
We just didn't think about these problems when the -arrow-
command came off the workbench.
 A "cludge" fix you can do...is to have an extra -at-
command at the end of the dataop to set the margin (mode,
etc.) back to that of the arrow's.

The left margin set by an arrow is two spaces to the right

In your test example, using -atnm 3030- in the dataop
instead of -at 3030- will obviate the need for the
kludgey fix-up with -at 1012-...whether this will suffice 
in your actual lesson depends on whether you want to 
-write- more than one line is the dataop unit.

I've been reading general interest notes today to try to
catchup with new features etc, and I've noticed a pattern:
Someone (eg Dowling-ames) will make a suggestion, receive
many comments (most to all favorable) including some/many
from systems level people, BUT NOTHING ever comes of it!??
   cases in point:
1) modify the pause to do a catchup (note 70+) this would
   modify only timed pauses to start the timing after
   the display is complete - wont affect anything else...
2) availability of data page to allow any author to see
   who to contact about permission to use/see the lesson,
   the lesson's 1 line description, lesson author's phone
   AND (new feature) lesson status (complete, incomplete)
3) notes 320 ¬+ 350 on having an option to show boundries
   of hidden chars - ie with the "write (blank tag with x
   number of spaces) -could optionally show a period at end

Patience.....! Many of these dandy little features are
eventually implemented (just wait around a few years).
On such a large and complex system even seemingly small
changes can have a large (adverse) effect if implemented
without sufficient thought. That -pause- with the built
in -catchup- _could_ mess up certain programs, example
upon request.

I would prefer that the available systems staff concentrate
on more urgent matters -- improvements to the on-line
catalog system for example -- than expend people-hours on
things which have lesser effects on students running.

---------- response 2

  01/16     18.48     daleske       ames

The pause/catchup request was a bad example. A change to 
executing a catchup for all timed pauses would definitely
restrict those users who wished to pause the system's ex-
ecution for the said time, but do not want to wait for the
entire output buffer to fill. (timing in this my example
might be off, as perhaps the output  buffer will always be
emptied before the minimum .75 pause would be executed.
However, the concept still applies).

If you want a catchup executed before timing is begun, you
need only place a catchup before the pause. Why force
everyone else to wait for the catchup?

The other ideas do rank merit and if they are being imple-
mented, fine. But if they arent, it would be nice to know
why not. Perhaps to keep continual discussion about pro-
jects that the sysprogs are already working on, we need a 
lesson to record those projects (major and minor) with
statuses

---------- response 3

  01/17     17.11     dowling       ames

Whoa there, John.

The proposed inclusion of the -catchup- in -pause- would
only apply to -pause-s that had a time (possibly 0)
specified. The specified keys would be active during the
catchup phase as well as during the timed period.

With these features, why would anyone want a -pause- without
catchup? True, a system conversion would be necessary to
change lessons using a timed pause without catchup to have
keys active without stopping the display, but system
conversions are frequently made following command changes.

I do not object to systems people saying that the proposed
change is lower priority than work currently in progress.
But I still feel that my idea is good.¬??W¬=??C¬=??D

one more time...
according to any/all info I've read bout PLATO, it was/is
meant to be a NATIONAL DATA-BASE for storing instructional
material - T/F?
if true, then the question of publishing completed lessons
which could be of use to general public is resolved
-its mandatory by definition-
consider the many duplications of effort - due to a lack of
knowledge as to what is available - and/or a new-comer to
the system trying to see what lessons are available and
which could be used by students anywhere (granted there are
some lessons which accompany a text and specific lecture,
in which case the text at least could be listed somewhere,
but I am again referring to lessons which could be used
by any student at any plato site)

no real sys answer except for we'll wait and see...

YES! We know its important!
What more can I say? Its a difficult job requiring much
thought. There are problems involved, including for example
the fact that once published a lesson may not be changed.
Does this fact mean that system conversions can't proceed?
(obviously not!) Who decides if a lesson is of suffient 
quality to be worth publishing? (who will be the "editor"
in otherwords?) What manner of printed form should a
list of published lessons consist? etc...
      The real question comes up in that whoever
writes the catalog (people are still argoeing about this) 
will affect an immense number of persons. I personally do 
not want the responsiblity of making all the decisions
involved.

One of the resources for finding out about lessons which

Then you can proceed from there to contact persons who have
had experience with PLATO lessons.

I have also said that I am more than glad to furnish signons
for anyone who finds a lesson description in "catalog" or

I agree with Judy. A main unit and an erase ought to have
analogous display functions. I think that inhibit erase
will be used less and less as the touch key inputs are tied
in to Tutor more and more effectively. Now that
-force firsterase- knows what touch inputs are, I use about
half as many inhibit erase commands in conjunction with
touch. I would think that bringing in an enable with an
imain unit would solve most of the problems caused by
changing the effect of inhibit erase.

  Of course, if you are an avid reader of these notes
and lesson "projects", you would know that indeed two
simultaneous PLATO executers are going to be attempted
someday. And the machine running Plato now, the Cyber 73,
is the type of "parallel processor" that you seem to be
talking about.

The basic problem with such a concept, is that the
experimental versions often destroy much of the databases
(common, storage, student records, lessons) that are
resident in ECS when they fail. Thus, automatically
switching to the established version will cause more harm
than good. We do make every effort to re-load a working
version as soon as an experimental one fails. This often
results in a 'yo-yo' effect, however, as we discover an
error and re-load the experimental version.
      I repeat the often said caution: Authors who work
on the non-prime time version are doing so at their own
risk, and we will not take any responsibility for the
reliability of the system during these few precious hours
that we get to develop and test software.

When using concepts, phrase is not marked up if there is
an unknown word or a spelling error.

Would it be possible to use separate system words for
unknown vocabulary with concepts and extra words in
regular judging. Or alternatively you could use the
same mark up system for both. I use both regular judging
and concept commands for the same arrow and this means
two different eraseu units or giving the student
something like:

uu or xx indicates an extra word or unknown vocabulary word

---------- response 1

  01/19     17.25     tenczar       s

you ask several things...
first...yes, spelling errors and unrecognized words cause
an immediate error exit from concept judging. Only when
these two errors do not occur does PLATO proceed to check
phrase errors. This was done for several reasons...
...maybe by correcting the spelling error or unknown word
   error, more sense can be made during phrase checking
...currently no markup exists to indicate both a spelling
   error and a broken phrase concerning the same word
...it was easier to program the way it currently is!

secondly, there has been a recent move to eliminate the
difference between extra words in answer judging (which
get xxxx markup) and in concept judging (which get uuuu
markup). both errors set the system variable -extra-...
however, only the system variable -vocab- is set by
the concept case...hence you can make use of this fact in
your feedback to the student. Also,

---------- response 2

  01/19     17.27     tenczar       s
...also, -specs okextra- is used by both answer and concept
but -specs okxvocab- is used only by concept.

Maybe someday after consulting all the users, we could
change the uuuu markup to xxxx. That seems like a good
thing to do.

yes...-specs okcap- has not been fully implemented in the
-answer- command. It does work properly in the -concept-
command, namely:
...the student can capitalize or not any word that the
   author does _NOT_ capitalize.
...but if the author has a capitalized word, then the
   student _MUST_ capitalize it. The assumption is made here
   that the author capitalized the word because he meant it.
   Hence things like proper names are handled properly.

a break from more important things (or just need a nice

Thanks for your attention to this. I hope you need your

students identify by asking questions. This is best
handled by concept statements. The correct answer is best

be capitalized and right now the students can get away
without capitalization.

I know that we're told to do our work during prime-time,
but that apparently doesn't guarantee that the system
will be stable.

As a result of the recent crash, a lesson that altered
audio command parameters in common failed to return the
common to disk. thus, two hours of difficult work were
lost.

If we were able to checkpoint common executably, the
same way that it is done with datasets, such problems
could be eliminated. The "autocheckpoint" feature won't
work in this case, because it doesn't allow the choice
of aborting changes.
Please - can we have the capability of returning common
to disk executably?

      I know the feeling, Mike -- we went to a dual-
copy system a long time ago for some of our router's
parameters... I have used disk storage/retrieval of
commons into declared temporary common, but this is
limited because these commons cannot be >1500 wds. The
advent of -initial- common makes these matters easier.

     I've been told that extending the ECS common limit
of 1500 words is on the job-board. For the time being, it
seems that a project as big as foreign languages could spare
the "wasted" 4 parts of disk space and declare a permament
common but still store the data on datasets.

The -key- reserved word has some problems that keep
bugging me and others from time to time.

1)      If a line error occurs it is changed unpredictably.
2)  -jumpout-s, disk i/o, and other system software
    change it in execution.
3)  In -foregnd- a student might accidentally hit
    a key in a place where input is not yet ready
    to be accepted. If autobroken, the value of
    -key- is changed to that value. (STOP should
    be an exception here of course)
4)  The "keynames" have to be mapped on to a 
    makeshift translation table to make them useful
    for manipulation or display (-plot- approximates
    the display mapping but -key-'s inconsistancies
    require mapping there too).

  It would be nice to make -key- consistant with
the basic idea of allowing TUTOR programs to process
individual KEY presses at terminals rather than
some "data" that just happens to be "right" 90: of the
time "so why not" make it available.

  What I propose would be to make the logic around
-key- maintain its integrity AND allow system supplied
adaptive functions to convert -key- to display and
TUTOR processing type codes. Possibly 2 functions would
be needed: one to convert -key- to internal code and the
other to convert key to a ROM address code (for display).
(ROM¬D-key-, internal¬D-key-, ROM¬Dinternal and internal¬DROM
 would make the functions logically complete) 
  These conversions would be in line with the current trend
toward "parameterizing" TUTOR code so it is not so machine
dependant.

  I believe it is intended that "key" should retain
its integrity over interrupts for disk processing and
computational or output breaks. You will find that
this is already the case with respect to dataset operations.
The changes to do this are relatively simple and could be
done anytime someone has some spare time.

I don't understand the 2nd page of suggestions at all.

Are you proposing to do away with "key" completely?
If not, where would these conversions be stored?
There _isn't_ any "internal code" for HELP, etc.
And what does ROM have to do with anything?
-plot- shows characters from the read/write memory, not ROM.
(showa and write show characters from both read only and
read/write memories.)

---------- response 6

He means read/write memory, of course.
What he is proposing is either a system variable or function
called, say, 'dspkey'. This would run through the tables
now use to convert key codes to internal codes.
Thus, when "a" is pressed, key=1 and dspkey(key)=1.
When "A" is pressed, key=0101 and dspkey(key)=07001.
When "*" is pressed, key=0147 and dspkey(key)=049.
When NEXT is pressed, key=0202 and dspkey(key)=0.
        He is also proposing a function to be used
in plotting, called say 'ramslot'. This would be used
like this:
at     1015
write  ¬6
pause  keys=alpha
at     1017
plot   ramslot(key)
which would plot the FONTed slot corresponding to that
key which was pressed.
        These are reasonable requests, but is the
conversion impossible without the tables?

Suggestions for unenlighted to consider!

plot "a"+128 plots an a.
plot "b"+128 plots a b.
...etc.

What he wants is a function to use in conjunction with the
plot command to do the necessary conversions to get the
right thing with the plot command. (like for example all
the funny things like ¬+?¬¬o¬p, etc.) Is his request more
feasible now? Why, you ask? If you do timing tests on
showa verses plot, you will find plot very much faster
that showa for single character plots. (like in talkomatic)

        I don't know about all the rest of you users out

characters and alternate font capabilities in these ter-
minals, I can't _begin_ to remember how to get to more than
just a few of them. So I would like to suggest something
like a -term font- and a -term altfont- which could show
us the proper key sequence to get things like ¬o, ¬+, and
so on.
        Another suggestion is something like a -term exterm-

internal to the lesson and use system -terms-. (Ever try
to do a -term talk- from inside TALKOMATIC?

ENOUGH! It's my humble opinion that there are quite enough

unnecessary additions!

Terms -talk-,-operator-,-grid-,-cursor-,-calc- all have a 
justification in that they deal either with on-line commun-
ications or computation or screen display (which IS necess-
ary if you have to design something). The terms you sug-
gest are hardly justifiable. Write down the keypresses you
need, and refer to your own sheet. You'll find that event-
ually you won't need it!

Talkomatic does indeed allow you to do a term -talk-: the
"term" while in the channel is actually simulated -- it's
not the real system term routine.

     There seems to be a misunderstanding here in regard to
what kent/unl actually proposed. He did NOT say that a
student should be allowed to override an -inhibit- term
command, only that there should be a way of accessing
system terms that might be inadvertently overridden by
terms within the lesson. Such a mechanism would benefit
not only the students using a lesson but the author of it,
in that he would now have more flexibility in his choice of
terms. Also, nothing was mentioned about this new term
being available to students; it could be made available
only to authors, as are so many of the terms. Also
something along the line of a -noexterm- command in the
ieu of a lesson could be devised for those authors who
absolutely do not want their terms overridden. With these
modifications, there should be no adverse consequences to
having such a setup. However, I, and I would (cont.)

with regard to whether such a setup is feasible from a 
software point of view. If it is _totally_ impractical, there
would be no purpose in any furthur discussion of whether
it would be desirable or not. However, if there is a 
chance of it actually being done, a continuation of the
debate would serve to uncover possible flaws that have not
as yet surfaced and would help to forstall a host of
complaints from authors who "didn't know the gun was loaded"
so to speak. In addition, such a continuation would most
likely result in suggestions for improvement of the setup
in ways which no one has yet conceived. Similar defenses
of this type of discussion have been frequently raised,

it has been declared possible by a Systems Response, that
those who raised the original objections direct their

to furthur suggestions as to how to improve the proposal.
This process should determine to the satisfaction of all
involved whether the idea is indeed worthwhile, useful,
and/or necessary. If the answer is no, then the process
should modify the concept until it either does meet those
requirements or is proven incapable of being so modified.

     The author will not lose control for 3 reasons:
     (1) The -term exterm- option will not override
         inhibited terms, only terms overridden by terms
         of the same name in the lesson.
     (2) The author would be able inhibit this option by
         a -noexterm- or -inhibit exterm- command.
     (3) The option could, if necessary, be restricted
         to authors.
     These restrictions should more than assure that
the author will keep control of the lesson. In fact, he
will have even more control because of the increased
number of options open to him.

where all the characters are; but, then, I can only spend
a very few hours a week on plato--not 5-10 hours a day like
some fortunate people [that includes off-terminal program-
ming]). And as for the -term terms-; well that was intend-
ed to help clear up the confusion of -term-s...sort of an
index to the -term-s. Also, AIDS is getting so huge, it's
getting hard to find specific things sometimes--so I think
some system redundancies are a good idea.

it somewhere. If that is the only place it is to be found,
you might waste a lot of valuable time searching for it(I
see where this would be particularly bad for someone who
only has one or two hours a week on PLATO.)
     Fortunately, however, there is some redundancy built
into the system in the form of cross-referencing, e.g. sup-
pose the routine you were looking for was stored in lesson
-library-. There are a variety of ways in which you can
enter it.

to segment it(either yourself or with -segment-),

altfont on
doto    1show,dex?1,length $$length=word length of string 
at      1+dex*40,200 $$40=(5 chars/word)*(8 spaces/char)
showa   string(dex)$mask$o77007700770077007700
at      5+dex*40,200
showa   string(dex)$mask$o00770077007700770077
1show 

This allows you to showa a whole word at a time, but makes 
you show each word twice. I used rhrc's "3?5".

Would this help you? If you have a lesson that needs say

another set of 5 chars. If you plan carefully which 
5 characters to manipulate and when in the lesson, the 
changing can be unnoticeable to students.
Or if your are using a full charset in one lesson and 
want to use 80: of it in another lesson: load the charset
then use char commands (or even load a different charset)
to overwrite the 20: with the characters appropriate for the
2nd lesson.

Dave Fumento in response 4 to general note 148 mentions
that he has been told that the ECS common limit was to
be extended beyond 1500. I read this to mean the CM
"common" (scratch) variables. I was wondering what the
thinking was in this area by the systems staff. The
ECS to CM wokspace bottleneck is a royal pain in the
large ECS resident database. If the upper limit of common
is stable at 8050 is there any hope of being able to drag
the entire common from ECS to CM to perform computations?
It would be nice if comloads were an optional part of
large ECS resident database manipulation.

any other usual response, anyone?

I assumed the opposite, that CM was not going to be

the ECS limit on temporary common length would be raised.

Wherein lies truth?

I wasn't talking about any hardware change to the 65K

scratch space. Ideally the 1500 would be raised to 8050.
Is the 1500 limit based on something within the architecture
of the system software or is it just a matter of free space
within CM?

PLATO hopes to be adding a new CPU over the summer
sometime. With this new CPU will be more central
memory (will be increased to around 95K?).
However, all of this new storage will be used by the
new operating system (KRONOS) that will come with
the new CPU. So you can expect that although we are
getting more CM, none of it can be used for PLATO.

   For those to whom economics are of mild interest,
65k of central memory costs about the same as 1M of ECS.

The cheerleaders admit that their only possible contribution

could have been moral support.

The snake routine currently in file "sd" is available for 
the library if authors would like it there. I was just

author interest seemed to warrant putting it into the 
library.

If you have a bunch of print requests for lessons with

    How about a compromise? I can put it into your code
buffer when you type in a new code. But the suggestion
of saving a few codes seems like a bit of overkill.
I mean, how many prints do you request at once? I have
never seen more than 5 or 6.

It would be nice to see a version where the last code you
typed in is saved in whatever variable is _currently_ used
when you enter your security code in the print program.

Thus, the normal buffer could be checked first, and if 
it didn't match, the temporary buffer could be checked.
If there was still no match, you could enter a new
code into the temporary save buffer.

It doesn't seem that 2 code buffers could really 
be called "several".

---------- response 8

  01/23     11.42     kawell       o

  Ok. I will put in a code buffer so that it will remember
the last code you typed in. When it checks the codes, it 
will first check your usual code, then it will check the
code buffer. Should be in the next version.

At an arrow, if you type in an incorrect response which
ends with a SUB character, the "no" judgement appears in 
the place you would expect. Now, if you press ERASE,
the "no" gets erased from the wrong position.

For example, suppose the answer to a problem is H?2SO?4.
The student types H?2SO? but misses the "4" key, then 
presses NEXT. The arrow responds with a "no" judgement.
When the student presses ERASE, the following is seen:

      ¬6 H?2S no==??[no?ˆ 
The same thing applies to such a "dangling" SUPER character
also.

Note that if you press NEXT rather than ERASE, the "no"
erases properly.

The highly secure PLATO personal note system is fairly
easily penetrated with access to course records in only
a few easy steps. To check this out, try--

1) Create an author signon.
2) Send a note to this signon.
3) NOW change the name of this signon to garbage.
4) THEN create another signon with the same name as the
       first.
5) Enter author mode using the second signon.
6) Read the note that was sent to the first author.
7) Change the name back.
8) Send the person whose notes you read a harmless note

Among other possible solutions: If every record in a course
had a unique serial number attached to it, and that number
was available to users, then notes, user data, and other
useful things could be stored and referenced on the basis
of a 12 bit serial mumber instead of a 108 bit changeable
name.

P-notes will always be insecure, just as the telephone
system is. In fact, anyone with a $10 cassette recorder
and 10 minutes of study in modems and the telephone system
could obtain any personal password on the system, provided
they were willing to tap the line and wait for the
targetted individual to sign-on.?
This problem is really an educational one. The ideal
solution is to educate students in such a way that they
would never consider such activity simply because they
had better things to do. Resorting to an ethical argument
assumes that somehow wiretapping p-notes became a priority
activity. If course work was doing an ideal job, students
would be so busy in constructive enterprises, even while
not enrolled, that the thought of engaging in trivial
activities like reading somebody else's electronic mail
simply would not arise. CERL's moderate security seems
reasonable in this light.

Since CERL doesn't sponsor courses, they are not in much
of a position to make a contribution here. The Computer
Science department, however, is in an ideal position to
assume a leadership position in this area, since so many
of the people that engage in directionless activity first
learn how to program in this department. I am currently
gathering material relevant to a course in "Self-Reliant
Computing," that intends to address some of these needs.
The basic idea is to involve student in all phases of a
small human-computer system development. Over a 4 year
period, students would engage in all phases of the system
development: conceptualization, proposal writing, contract
negotiation, program planning, administration, human
factors analysis, social impact evaluation and, of course.
hardware and software development, documentation and
maintenance. (continued).

The intent is to instill a sense of independence and
responsibility by making the students totally responsible
for the success or failure of the project. After
participating in this sort of course, I think the
probability that a student would waste his time on stealing
p-notes, passwords etc or writing lessons without a clear
intellectual focus would be greatly reduced. I would be
glad to here from anyone regarding suggestions for reading
material etc, Science magazine is an excellent source of
articles. A good literary background exists in _Walden_,
_Moby Dick_ and Pirsig's recent book. Many chapters in books
by Sackman and DeGreene are useful here. The movie "The
Graduate" is an excellent, though aging, analysis of the
essential development of problem-formulation in addition
to problem-solving abilities.

   A reminder that high temperature is a major factor in
contributing to terminal down time. Site directors and
project leaders should inquire of their maintenance
people as to the condition of the terminal air filters.
    These filters are easily cleaned with a vacuum or
air hose or they can be simply shaken dust free out of
doors. Also a water rinse and air dry is helpful.
    To remove the filter it is necessary to first remove
the back panel from the terminal and and just pull the
filter free. After cleaning and installing the filter
again, be certain the fan or fans are free to rotate.
The air flow on a Plato terminal is important.

  yes there is a chance but not a very great one...
I have used the terminal before and the priority is the
same as it is for cerl. i.e. students first, authors later
so with only one terminal there it gets quite a lot of use
by students because it is convenient for them also. The
terminal is currently being used to develop a link between
the plato system and the DEC-10 system (correct me if i am
wrong) and will be removed when the link is finished.
therefore there are no guarantees you can get on and no
guarantees that you will be able to stay on once the

        It is being used to develop a link between the

In the next rewrite of the course editor, would it be pos-

appear to instructors if a non-system router is attached?
But instead of going to "mrouter", have it jump directly to
the named router. It might seem that instructors should
be taught to type the router name at the choose-a-lesson
arrow, but this little feature could greatly ease the task
of site personnel and the confusion of new users, while
making some curriculum projects much more self-contained

Actually, we had something similar in mind already:
instead of the option in which the instructor types
a lesson name, that option would just take you to a
specified lesson. This is a little more general than
your case, because that lesson might not be the router,
particularly when using the system router. But your

To avoid confusion and misunderstanding, you should con-

"off-line" or "non-editable". In the unlikely event you
happen to attach a file which is on "helen", chances are
very high that the pack will be removed from under you
and when you go to return info to disk you will be unable
to do so. This has already happened to an unwary author
or two, so be careful. As Bob suggests, don't you try to
do anything with a file which is on "helen"...have Sheila

The messages are deliberately non-committal and our position
on "an hour from when?" is that it will come up an hour
from the moment you happen to glance at the screen.
You would get no better answer by calling the operator,
a systems programmer, or a computer engineer directly be-
cause none of these people is ever able to give an estimate
to the minute. Computers are very hairy beasts to service,
ya' know? Not to mention being somewhat unpredictable.
As for getting tapes on which state at what time the machine
went down: we would need an ungodly number of tapes to be
able to do that with any accuracy and the additional infor-
mation would be of no practical use anyway given the general
nature of our estimates of returning to service!

Now hold on a sec...
My experience is that the estimates put up during "downers"
is quite accurate (I often wait them out.) But what is this
non-committal stuff??? Why not just put up "back in a
while" if that is your motivation?
Actually, I was very pleased this weekend to see messages:
"...will return approximately 9:00 PM Urbana time"
"...will return approximately midnight Urbana time"
during the two long downers. At least here people know
when things will be back and not a worst case (they JUST
went down so it IS a full hour) assumption as you insist
it should be.
The point is, it seems like a simple matter to display
the _estimated_ time of return, rather than the ambiguous
"... return in one hour" kind of display.

"not allowing the change of an author's name" doesn't
mean that you would be stuck forever with a misspelling
of "smiht". It means that in order to change the author's

destroy "smiht" and to make a new record "smith". That is
a trivial thing to do.

         The idea I proposed the last time this security
problem was discussed is to tie an author's notes to both
his sign-on and his password. An author voluntarily
changing his password would be given a warning that his
current notes would be unavailable, but would be recover-
able by changing his password back (unless the notes were
deleted by his course director). One disadvantage to
this system would be if an author forgot his password,
but how often does that happen to authors?

The suggestion of deleting an author's notes when he

problem: several other facilities, both on the system
and written by individual authors, depend on name/course
checks. If a command were created to read more data than
the author's name, a lot of these abuses could be
corrected.

There are times when an author's name must be changed;
misspelling is one of them. To have this give the side
effect of destroying all his current pnotes is, in my
opinion, not desirable.?
I think this problem is overly paranoid. There are all
kinds of ways an author must trust his course director.
If a person doesn't have the integrity to leave your pnotes
alone, or you don't trust him that much, then you should
not accept a signon from him, or he shouldn't be a course

        There are students here, who have nothing better,
indeed, _like_ nothing better, than to watch an author sign
in, and then when he has gone, try what they think his
password to be. Ergo: here at PFW there is frequent
password changing
        I think that the problem we would have here is
obvious to everyone. A lot of stolen sign-ons... which
will get your notes read anyway, soooooooo....
        There are ways to get around almost any security
set up that can be devised. Education, I think, may be the
answer. If everyone knows that p-notes can be read then
they won't be leaving notes lie around in their file.
        If you ask me, the problem is self-policing.

        It means the screen is getting old. Start worrying
when displays at the center of the screen lose dots, or
when dots remain on after a full-screen erase.
A partial border can make the screen cranky when it comes
to starting, though. The best fix for this is simply to
hold a flourescent desk lamp against the screen while 
the terminal is turned on.

If you can't rip your flourescent overheads off the
ceiling to get them close to the panel, just cover the
screen with a sheet of paper (terminal is on but borders
not lit) turn on the overheads and pull the paper away.
The sudden burst of light will usually do the trick.
Also a sudden burst of sunlight from a window usually
does the trick.

if the borders are hard to fire, and/or the partial borders are messing up your display, there is a simple adjustment
you can make that will usually fix it (unless the panel and power supply are extremely old). enter the problem in
lesson 'repair', or call the I+M group at 217-333-7466.

In the common editor, if you are editing a series of

in a variable number after you have pressed next from
the last variable on the page. Could this be changed so
that when you press next after editing the last variable
on the page, you automatically go to the next variable?

It does appear that people are more reluctant to express

PLATO, by any stretch of the imagination.

For the record, Dave's addition to the -touch- machinery
will simplify some things enormously, and make others
possible that were just too much effort to do before.
As for Larry's stuff -- I've been using it for over a

  01/26     16.58     galcher       uimatha

When dealing with datafiles in conjunction with the
-readset- command: it would be convenient if -readset-
returned as its optional third argument the number of
blocks currently filled with data. I would assume that
this number is available since is is displayed on the
main options page when you examine a datafile with the
system datafile editor.

One of the reasons this would be convenient is that I
am sure that some author groups have written there own
special statistics packages to deal with the data collected
by datafiles. But to decide whether a statistics program
should be run or not, you must manually examine the
datafile and see if any new data has been added. It would
be easier to just examine the number of blocks used or
possibly return the last date data had been transfered
into the file with the one -readset- involved than having
to back out and actually look at the datafile.

       Indeed. The present structure is clumsy, in that
-output- commands cannot be read, and that the next record
(not the next -outputl-, or signoff record) cannot be read.
        In addition, it would be useful to be able to
specify that courses OR datafiles are being attached. The
-zreturn- return is not adequate.

each timing consisting of a doto loop of 1000 reiterations
performed 32 times. these 32 timings were averaged by the

  each set of 32 timings did not deviate more than
_?_.000003 seconds.
 the doto loop by itself timed at .000035 seconds.
okay:

calc    n3?frac(n4=2)    timed at .000057 seconds
calc    n3?abs(n4)$mask$1 timed at .000012 seconds

In non-judging we have the -compute- command but it has
no analoge to -storen-. Could something along the lines of
-eval(string)- function be implimented to do this?
-eval- would compile a string of constants with simple
arithmetic operators into a value:
calc    string?'010+99?2'

I think bowery's idea is a good one. If you have

delimiters, it is a real hassle to get all of them
seperated. For instance:
  no12 has the string:
         2,095,-235
  ok, now how does one get each of these three numbers
  into three different variables?

If it is typed in at an arrow, storen can be used.

Sorry about the poorly written note.... it was late.

After thinking more about the basic idea:
1) this should be a command and not a function
2) it would function differently from the -compute-
   command in that a) it would be for evaluation of strings
   of constant alphanumeric data b) it would NOT be used
   for looping evaluation of an expression so no buffer
   would have to be maintained (cutting down some overhead)
3) one could define the delimeter(s) for separate
   evaluations
4) it would end evaluation on either the character count
   specified or on o00 or when no more vars were available
5) some feed back would have to be given as to the number
   of variables filled, characters scanned and types of
   errors encontered (negative values of -formok- are open
   and possibly -zreturn- or -wcount-[?])

That's an approximation of my idea... modifications?

For the record: "Current" allotment is a virtual figure
which does not necessarily reflect the amount of memory
actually available to the site. The true, guaranteed
figure is the "base" allotment, which for the past

I personally would rather wait until both the embeds and

released, unless there is some question as to whether the
embeds will be added at all (which does not seem to be the

It would be nice to have a variable, similar to the
current "errtype", which would be a little more
specific as to the cause of an error in a routed
lesson. Currently, errtype = 2 means:

       * Fatal condense error, or
       * Jumpout to another router, or
       * Lesson deleted by an author (not noted in AIDS).

It would be nice to be able to tell these three
conditions apart, so that it would be possible to
tell the student exactly what happened to the lesson.

        It's not that I don't like PLATO, I do. However,
the fact that its use is hindered by the not enough ECS
at my site, tends to lessen the education value it
posesses. My concern is getting students into the lessons
they want to use, but when they try a lesson and it flashes
up the message: THERE IS A PROBLEM:........ the students
and the site director ask me to fix the problem. It then
becomes rather akward to say that it is the systems problem
and we must live with it. Then they ask how they can
justify a PLATO terminal to the people with the purse
strings. when students can't access lessons during the
day. All I can ever say is that PLATO has a great capacity
for teaching and instruction, but at the moment, it is not

The real problem is trying to run a bunch of one and two
terminal sites. In larger sites it is possible to share
lessons and thus reduce the ECS per terminal needed. But on

To reply to berger of mfl, building on what Bill Golden

It should also be noted that these problems are carefully

they get service. Unfortunately, this person is not always
the ultimate user and rarely seems to communicate the
information to other users at the site. We are very
sensitive to the poor "advertising" that small-site usage
results in. It is doubly troubling when users at these

Dear John,
   When the rotate command is done, it is changed into

it has not been done.

Re: Possible destruction of old notes.

This idea should be reconsidered. As I have pointed out
previously, NOTES is the first conferencing type system
to exceed 10,000 items per year or the first large scale
usage of a computer-based communications system. Hence,
this database is of potentially high value to future
researchers interested in the development of this new
medium. I would say make two mag tape records--store one
and send one to the Library of Congress.

To those who say that most of what appears in NOTES is

a similar garbage to useful item ratio, yet archival records
of these media are maintained.

then I had weeded out the ones I really did not need.
But even so, if all the old notes are distroyed, all
that needed information will be gone and irretreveable

In regard to the destruction of old notes it seems to me
that there are two issues at stake: the need to preserve
valuable notes for research and general use and the need
for more space and the conservation of systems resources.
This could be resolved most equitably by deleting just
those notes which are irrelevent (foolish¬ little¬ comments
and the announcement¬ of¬ various systems errors) and those
which repeat, for the umpteenth time, a request for a 
system feature which will never be implemented. In this
way we could save those notes which are of little import
to the system while conserving space.
     There are some (mke b/cornell) who suggest that this
would be censorship, I disagree. It would, instead, be
editing. One does not censor a collection of writings
by excluding unimportant material; one merely saves the 
reader the trouble and time of reading it. Censorship

---------- response 9

  01/30     12.07     ken       cornell

would be preventing the person from writing the note in
the first place (something which would be next to impossible
on this system or at least not worth the effort). This
would merely be the decision not to publish the work--the
ultimate right of all editors in this world.
        While this might not be feasible it is certainly
something the Plato community might wish to discuss and
the system people might want to consider.

  01/30     12.52     mike b       cornell

       I must indeed object to Ken's suggestion, on two
grounds.

        First, a major consideration in any effort to pre-
serve old notes must be the cost of that effort. To simply
write all the old notes to tape is a fairly quick, simple
operation, whereas assigning someone the responsibility of
sifting through every one (making notes on features which
have already been suggested, for example) would be extremely
time-consuming, boring and (most important) expensive.

        Second, as I understand the system policy regarding
these notes, the system staff cannot be considered editors
editing a work. Notes are individual expressions of opinion
and not written "to" the system--they are communications
with the entire PLATO community, and I don't think the
system would want to take the responsibility for deleting
parts of that communication. (continued)

---------- response 11
  01/30     12.56     mike b       cornell

The fact that the system staff will not delete a General
Note, save at the request of the author, is an expression
of this reluctance.

        And, finally, if we are agreed that a major value
of old notes may be to future scholars, then we, being as
we are at the focus of the issue, are certainly not quali-
fied to say which notes will be of particular importance.
The very (alledged) redundancy of notes may, in fact, be
considered significant in any study of the development of
this telecommunications system.

_Especially_ don't delete requests for new features.

If, for example, the evolution of the tutor language were
to be studied, a major focus of interest would be impetus
for change -- from whom it came, whether users rose up in
a wave and demanded some new command or whether some fringe
person in the system -- a high-school kid or some frenzied
remote site freelancer or an urbanaite -- drew out from his
twisted biocybernetic fantasies a need for something
outlandish, proposed it once, twice, three dozen times, and
finally saw its fruition.

Mike's right -- it ain't possible to tell in advance which
are the relevent details to be extracted from raw data.

Hey, guys, how about a command called 'drawb'? It would
be similar to 'circleb', only for drawing broken lines. I
think this command would be very useful in graphing and
in many other fine displays. If the regular draw command
is used, a large amount of space is wasted, and if a doto
loop is used, time is wasted. I really would appreciate
such a command, and I think many others would also.

---------- response 1

  01/28     14.13     judy       pso

A -drawb- would indeed be convenient, no doubt about that!

However, you need to realize that -drawb- would not be
nearly as fast as -draw-, because:
When you say -draw 1010;1212-, the terminal needs to be
sent 3 pieces of information:
1) make a line (and not a character)
2) starting point
3) ending point
Using this information the _terminal_ electronics generates
a line. For a -drawb-, one would have to send to the
terminal the information:
make a line; 1st starting point; 1st ending point;
2nd starting point; 2nd ending point; 3rd starting point;
3rd ending point; etc.

Thus you see -drawb- would not be nearly so fast as -draw-.

---------- response 2

  01/28     14.34     judy       pso

The "next generation" terminals should include a dashed
line generator so that you (the computer) will be able to
send to the terminal only the information:
1) make a dashed line
2) starting point
3) ending point
This would make -drawb- as fast as -draw-.

Note:
The -circle- and -circleb- commands work by repeated short
-draws- thus:
Start at (origin+cos(0),origin+sin(0))
Draw line
Go to (origin+cos(2¬p=n),origin+sin(2¬p=n)
Go to (origin+cos(2?2¬p=n),origin+sin(2?2¬p=n))
Go to (origin+cos(3?2¬p=n),origin+sin(3?2¬p=n))
etc. for n steps. In the case of circleb, alternate
positions are simply skipped to and drawn.
The process of selecting n is such that the result
is a circle to within the accuracy of the plasma screen.
This, too, will be altered when we get
intelligent terminals, so that the circle will

I don't know whether any one knows. I put it in very
early, with some queasiness about its utility and
maintainablity. I think we have all felt that it is a
feature which may be useful for debugging but is not a
feature that we can always maintain. So consider it
permanently provisional and subject to removal, degradation,
or improvement at any time.

I have just had my lesson deleted out from under me
for the fifth time in a half hour.

Because the common in my lesson wasn't updated when
my lesson was deleted, I lost the work that I had
gotten done between deletions.

I know this has been discussed before - could it be
given some priority, please?

An acceptable alternative would be to install several
million more words of memory.

Note: my lesson was deleted - I was not "stop1'd" out.

Somebody with your experience should know what to do
about it, Mike.

If you MUST alter your common and MUST NOT get deleted
during that time, enter under a student signon. When
ECS is tight, authors are always getting deleted--and I
have heard that the Language Lab has been running very
full. Your only safe route to revising your common is
to use a "student" signon.

Provide CERL with $million and perhaps we can get another
million words of ECS.

I personally am against the deletion of authors.
I think that the problem of abuses by authors during
high-student-use times can be controlled with the
use of "site".

There are many authors working at our site, writing
and testing out lessons, and quite often we have to
back out non-scheduled students in order to let our
authors do their work.

The removal of the automatic delete for authors would
be another step towards autonomous sites --- with
individual sites more and more determining policy
depending on their own priorities, etc. This would be,
in my opinion, a positive step forward.

board. My first choice would be (as suggested earlier) to
be able to set deletability of authors by the ECS manager
in "site". My second choice would be to have the author
records retain their current status.

Although I personally don't have a problem with finish

occurs.

setting priorities within the router won't help unless the

Being a mere author, and not a site director, I may not have
any right to comment but that never seems to stop anyone
anyhow. I would suggest that, if possible, authors who are
working on lessons (i.e., who condense by shift-stop or
shift-data from their lesson) should not be deleted but
allowed to continue to work in their lesson. However,
those who are using lessons (i.e., wo condense by data from
the author mode page) should continue to have the low
statue they now enjoy. In this way an author who is
working on his lesson is not penalised for doing so at a
reasonable hour and the author who was enjoying the uses
of a 'blank check' would not have the libery to do so
during prime time.
        This is at least worth considering (I hope).

It's not clear to me that automatic deletion of authors
really does any good, since browsers and gamesters often
have student/multiple signons, and since authors working
on legitimate curriculum projects may suffer undeservedly.
It doesn't seem to me that automatic deletion of any one
signon type is the answer.

Another argument against automatic deletion of anyone is
that it is rather expensive to the system to have authors
condense lessons, get thrown out, condense again, etc.etc.
This puts a strain not only on the condensor, but on the
ECS manager, which may have to move things around in the
lesson buffer to find space for the lesson, etc.
Naturally, this is hardest to do and uses up more CPU
time when the most ECS is in use, which is of course
the time when deletions would be happening. So -- you
can't win. Perhaps we should do away with deletions on an
experimental basis for a while.

Sometimes an instructor who wishes to run his whole class
through a single short lesson will create a multiple for
the purpose. Deleting multiples would stop this (valid)
use of the multiple signon. I agree that the site director
should have option on who gets bounced when, but I also see
the problems caused by site "network."
As for the finish unit, I was once told by someone who
knew the system fairly well that it would be nigh unto
impossible to ensure the finish unit being executed.
It was said that when the condensor (or some other task)
needed ECS it could not wait even one timeslice; it
needed the memory RIGHT AWAY and the heck with the
finish unit. Is this true? Would a system programmer
please shed some light on this subject?

Deleting authors does serve the useful function of
telling them that students need the ECS and suggesting,
perhaps, that they try to work at times when there is
not a heavy student load on the system. That in fact
this doesn't happen is clearly illustrated by the
times on the notes complaining about the lack of ECS.

Dave Fumento's suggestion is exactly what I have to do in
some of my very sensitive programs to MAKE SURE that I know
EXACTLY what is going to be stored in my permanent copy of
common. I have to set aside a block on one of my datasets
for the "permanent"-permanent copy of common, and then
the lesson has to have an -initial common- unit that
reads the "real" permanent copy from the dataset into
ECS common. Every time I want to do a "checkpoint", I
transfer the image of ECS common to the dataset. Also,
just for insurance, I have to have a -finish- unit that
does one last "checkpoint", to make sure that the most
recent copy is on the dataset. I think that's rather a
hassle to have to go through, especially since it could
be done much more efficiently (not to mention flawlessly)
at the systems level, if only because it costs me two

SPICE is a high-powered analog circuit analysis program
which was written at the University of California. It can
give DC transfer curves, frequency response, and transient
analysis of circuits containing BJT's, FET's, and MOSFET's.
It is now available on PLATO. Contact Doug Brown if you
are interested in using it.
   send a personal note to 'doug brown' of 'p'
   or visit 568 Engineering Research Lab, UIUC
   or call (217)-333-0766
   or remain ignorant forever about circuit analysis.

Suggestion for the execution display: it would be
convenient to have an S command to save the essentials
of the display in the save buffer. It seems that quite
often people write down the info and then copy it into
a Pnote or some such thing, and S would simplify that.
Low priority, of course, but it would be nice...

You are interpreting the data incorrectly. Whenever the
system goes down, ECS copies of lessons are lost. But if
the system which is then loaded is the same as the one which
had been in, binary copies of most lessons will exist on a
disk and delay is on the order of one second per lesson. If
a new version is loaded. which is what usually happens
during non-prime time, all lessons need to be recondensed.

---------- note 40 indenting
  02/02/76     12.52     jim       pso

some time ago the subject of "indenting" (micro i) lines in
the editor was brought up. i would like to see such a
feature implemented on PLATO because it would make teaching
TUTOR much easier. consider the following:
*
write  some question...
arrow  1010
specs  bumpshift $$ indent symbol (¬D) is MICRO i; TRY IT!!
answer <an,the>(idea,apple)
write  That is the legend...
wrong  eve
write  Try again, for...
no
writec ntries¬,¬,¬,etc.
endarrow
wouldn't it be easier to teach the concept of regular ¬+
judging commands if we said: after the arrow, judging com-
mands begin at the left margin. if that judging command is
matched, the indented (regular) command which follows is
executed. this would clear up many fuzzy heads. comments?

---------- response 1
  02/02/76     13.43     jan       park

since i don't have to teach many new authors how to
use tutor, this feature would mean little to me, other
than: 1. a few extra key presses to set the margin
       2. loss of the margin space (assuming a micro i
          will use up a word of space in the block(?))

your suggested change would probably neither hinder nor
help the existing programmer/authors whose responsibilities
do not include training new authors...so, if it makes your
task alot easier, i see no reason to delay the change.

---------- response 2
  02/02/76     14.11     fritz       ames
  I like it! It makes the complex oddities of judging
much clearer and easier to read. How long has this been
allowed?

         If these ¬Ds would be used a great deal, as
they would probably be if most people originally learned
with them, would it not be wiser to select a character
which would not look !rather strange"(for lack of being
able to write out what it really appears as) when
printed?

        Or, if CERL is going to be getting a Diablo
printer soon, is this going to be of any worry?

---------- response 4
  02/02/76     14.49     judy       pso

I thought the idea was to make the additional indents
optional. Thus, one could choose to indent any group
of lines (commands) in order to improve legibility.

Wouldn't just TAB TAB be the simplest way to do it?

---------- response 5
  02/02/76     18.13     tenczar       s

to answer Judy, the problem is that some TUTOR commands
interpret a blank command following them as a continuation
of the previous command and some don't...so, consider the
following (in light a non-visible indenting scheme):

arrow  1010
       answer  cat
       write   yes, you have the correct
               answer George

is the last line above a part of the -write- command or

Though the case sited in Tenczar's response illustrated
his point, it is unlikely one would find such a construct
in actual code. The H option can answer any question you
might have about a particular line.

Is the following so incomprehensible?

arrow   1510

not to overkill, but:

did you know that...

answer lalala
       write  hoo hoo hoo

and
answer lalala write hoo hoo hoo

are currently identical in function now!!! That is, the
answer command "uses" a blank tag as the "mark" to tell
that this next line is additional words for the on-going
answer command! This is _THE_ problem I have been trying to
point out with an invisible indentor.

Well folks, this is the third request for conditional at

may have been some I have missed. TUTOR could use a
universal conditional construct (like the PASCAL case, but
less verbose?) but unless that is provided, let it be.

The goal is that the system should support 2 TIPS at
full load. Working it out, 1000 ms/sec divided by
500 users, gives 2 TIPS. Some use fewer, some use more.

I would think that a cpulim of 1.5 would give you a
feeling for the "worst-possible" conditions.

Trying to get the "feel" of a lesson as a student is
very hard. You have to really TRY to go at the pace a
student would go. You also have to work for a long time,
in order that your TIPS will average in the same way
a student's will average.

It's particularly useful when SDing a long display whose
length you don't know, but which has a non-display command
at the end. Thus you can stop when you want, without
skipping the unrecognized command and showing the next
display command, which may be part of a different display.

In lesson "cccp" (no inspect code) are a micro table
and charset for simulating the keyboard layout used
in the Soviet Union. Examples of lessons using this
are rfly, rshow, and rgeom. This arrangement was created
by Peter Maggs (maggs/law) for a Moscow demo a couple
years ago.

I assume you are already familiar with the charset
"russian" in "charsets", which associates letter
phonetically for ease of studying Russian. This set is
due to Connie Curtin and associates, and its layout is
much easier to use if one already touch types English.

Send me a pnote or term-talk if you want any more
information on the use of these. Also try pressing
term and typing t on the title page of lesson
rgeom which gives you direct access to a Russian keyboard
display. (Do it fast or you will miss your chance.
Alternatively, take lesson rpop and answer no to the
first question.

I hope you are thinking of making up a learn to type
Russian lesson.

If you want to see how I do arrows for Russian answers
you might want to look at the part of cccp that deals
with slides. Be sure to display the lines with H
so you can see the hidden font keys.

Perhaps the auto-answer ports could be interfaced with the
software to give a coded series of tones indicating the
computer could not guarantee 1500 wds of ECS. This would
determine whether or not you could sign on, I believe.
The cheapest alternative would be to disable the auto-ans
altogether when 1500 wds could not be promised, but then
the user would not know if the auto-ans was broken or if
memory was short. Perhaps they could be set to be "off the
hook" when memory was short; the busy signal would be your
signal a) ECS is tight (ie, the system is "busy"); or b) all
the dial up ports are in use.

---------- response 2
  02/03/76     12.12     perry       uw

   The check to see if there is enough memory is not made
until your password has been entered. It would not make
much sense to check memory available at the moment of
dial up, since that would certainly change by the time
you had finished signing on.
   Also there are only 8(?) dial up ports, as compared to
950(?) or so terminals that are more permenantly wired into
the computer.

In many, many cases there are things that can be
accomplished when memory is limited -- this often includes
editing or talking. And the two or three minute call
it takes to find out how much memory is available won't
cost you more than $2., I believe. Considering how much
you must pay when you do stay connected, I can't believe
that that is really significant.

   Because you should have calc_s_, not calcc...

   The calcc indexes into individual assigned calcs,
and the calcs assigns a value to a variable issued in
the first tag, ie:

calcc n1,i1?1,i2?2,i2?nˆ2,bleep?funct(gorki)
calcs n1,i1?1,1,2,sqrt(infin),zˆ2

   And, since numeric values are recognized as
dummy arguments for the calcc, no condense error was
issued.

There is still some discussion (controversy?) over what
should happen after drawing a circle or partial circle.
It has been proposed that the screen position should be
restored to the center. However, after a partial circle
(or rcircle or gcircle) it seems natural to many people
to keep drawing from the last point on the arc. For
consistency, it might also be advisable to not return to
the center of a full circle. Two questions therefore:
1) Should there be an "at center" following a partial
circle?
2) Should there be an "at center" following a full
circle?

---------- response 1
  02/03/76     16.23     dave fuller       uimc

    Since the center of a circle can always be
saved somehow, it would seem to be more logical to assume
that the -wherex,y- locations should remain at the end
of the arc, or circle. Computing the endpoint of an arc
for continuation of a graphic can be messy, whereas the 
storage of the screen location is not.
    In any case, if I needed to return to the center
of the circle, I would be doing it myself, anyhow, just 
to preserve program clarity. Using any assumption, such
as the default -where- after a circle draw, is likely to
cause problems sometime in the future, no matter how sincere
the reasoning for making it that way originally.

---------- response 2
  02/03/76     18.26     j wilson       unidel

I would also favor retention of current functions.

In addition to Dave's reasons (and because I know of several
programs that would require modification), it seems to me
that the relation, -draw-:-rdraw- :: -circle-:-rcircle-,
should be retained as much as possible. Consequently,
all four commands should leave *wherex,y* at last
screen position, or -draw- and -circle- should and
-rdraw- and -rcircle- should leave ir unchanged.

---------- response 3
  02/03/76     18.31     blomme       s

    One warning: anything tied to "last thing drawn"
may be a problem, especially considering that the method
used in drawing circles may be different on the newer
terminals. Only when writing or drawing has an
obvious end point should the where be set there.

The clockwise/counterclockwise possibility is an

of "flow", such as elementary reading people who want
to form letters in the same way they are printed.

An arc has obvious endpoints whereas a circle does not.
How about:

rcircle radius $$ returns wherex,wherey to center...(where else?)
rcircle radius,angle1,angle2 $$ leave x,y at last pt drawn

Wouldn't this permit relocatable drawings consisting of
intermixed straight and curved sections?

---------- response 8
  02/04/76     11.17     white       p

Consideration is currently being given to what will
happen when the terminal computes and draws the lines
for a circle, rather then sending the endpoints of the
lines over the phone line. It is expected that circles
would then be drawn so fast that the "flow" might not
be important. Also, whatever is decided now should
be implementable on the "intelligent" terminals.

---------- response 9
  02/04/76     17.18     j wilson       unidel

I'd also settle for dividing the resetting of *wherex,y*
between one- and three-tag -circle-s.

Larry, do you propose that we should start doing our
jumping frogs and flowing symbols manually? Or will
there be a -scircle- (for slow circle)? and an
-srcirclb-????? It boggles the mind.

   While arcs do indeed have a direction defined, they
may not be drawn from one end to the other by the
actual algorithm involved. In this case, since a direction
is fairly clearly defined, it is only a problem of being
sure that the system algorithms do a final "clean-up" to
reset the final screen position. However, consider that
there are still some nasty problems here when one has
arcs that go off-screen or are terminated by running
out of "windows"--then the question seems to be whether
the final where position should be that specified by the
command or the position of the last dot (in the direction
specified) that is actually plotted.

Last dot plotted for both arc and circle:
I am recommending this for consistency...because it is
possible to specify an off-screen circle center with
on-screen plotting. Leaving wherex,y set to an off-
screen location doesn't feel right to me.

If this is ok. then would be most convenient to
    1) leave at last dot plotted for arcs
    2) leave at center for complete circles

I know that I might get jumped on for making a frivolous
request, so let's hope this one's not so....

Wouldn't it be nice to have a judging command that was the
universal equivalent of -storen-? In some lessons it could
be very useful to drag out each word in the judging copy,
one at a time.... it could be of the form:

storew n1,20 $$ 20 being the number of chars to save

It should take out numbers too, but stored as characters.
If people wanted the numbers separately, they could use
-storen- beforehand.

Naturally, this is not too high a priority, but it does
sorta seem logical?

This would be a perfect addition to the answer judging

parsing done has to be done taking into account all
the different delimiters TUTOR has...something on the
system level that would take care of that would be won-

An addition would be to allow any -specs- in affect (i.e.
alphxnum,allwords) to alter the word structure for purposes
of -storew-.

         Yes. This is definitely a needed function when
constructing code generators, flexible response analyzers,
even dialogues. I would like to see this given a high
priority (especially as, as I understand it from judging,
the word length and position are stored in the judging
"hash tables" and can be used to find the word in the
buffer).
        Meanwhile, some purposes can be found by using
the numerical vocabs options to decide what words are being
used in an answer without a horrid mass of related but
different concepts.

Same here. The vocabs/concept type of judging can be
augmented enormously by a bit of simple parsing on the part
of the user, but it invariably requires that words be
sucked out of the judge buffer and put into an alphameric
array. This simple process is very wasteful when done
on the user level since info the system judger already has
must be recomputed in order to determine word boundaries.

Actually I was going to suggest something similar to the
-open- and -close- commands that work on words (as defined
by the system) rather than single chars. I have been
putting it off to try and figure out exactly what it would
do. After considering the possibilities, a very logical
way for it to work would be:

openw vector(0),20 $$ 20 vars available to open into
Student enters "some somethings are things" and:

vector(0)= some¬0¬0¬0¬0¬0¬0
vector(1)= somethings
vector(2)= ¬0¬0¬0¬0¬0¬0¬0¬0¬0¬0
vector(3)= are¬0¬0¬0¬0¬0¬0¬0
vector(4)= things¬0¬0¬0¬0

ensues.

many of the responses to the previous note on indenting
(2/2/76, public note ¬$40) discussed implementation details.
----------

i would like some comments concerning the concept of
indenting "answer-contingent regular commands". this
could be used when TUTOR is taught to new users in an
effort to clairify the difficult concept of which regular
commands are executed after a student response.

of course, the use of indenting would be _optional_. if you
choose to use it, fine...if you wanted to continue with
the current format, you could do that also.
P.S. the current method of indenting (using "¬D") can be
fully operable with just a little more work. while any
other method would take a week of Wednesdays.

between the -arrow- and -endarrow-, all judging command

  I think it's an excellent idea. One thing I don't
understand, though... You keep saying IF indenting is
implemented. When I saw your note ¬$40 (with the comments

and it condensed and worked fine. What additional

    I think optional indenting would be a big step
forward for new authors particularly. When I
first started writing in Tutor I found the judging
business by far the most confusing part, and the
new programmers I have initiated have had the
same problem.

   Would it be possible to indent any command one
desired, and to indent optionally either 0, 1, or 2 tabs
for further readability?

---------- response 4
  02/04/76     11.21     celia       pso

The only reservation I have is that the new author might
be led to believe that indenting or not indenting causes
different behavior. For example:

arrow   1010
answer  some answer
calc    right?right+1
write   That's right.
answer  some other answer
write   Yes!
endarrow

When "right! is only incremented in the one case, and not
the other, the new author will say confusedly, "But it
should always be incremented, because it is not indented!"

I'm afraid that in trying to clarify, we may just muddle.

---------- response 5
  02/04/76     11.24     alan       reading

Indenting answer-contingent regular commands makes it
much easier to see what is happening at an arrow. This
practice should be encouraged in new authors not only to
make it easier understand arrow processing, but as good
coding practice (like defining variables).

You can indent any command you want as often as you want:

write hello!

Speaking as one who has taught several programming
languages. I would suggest separating the indenting
from the explanation of how judging works, for the
reason Celia mentions. The student should be taught
that he SHOULD indent answer-contingent commands (do
we still use that term?), but also carefully taught
that the functioning of the commands has NO bearing
on how (or whether) they are indented.?
By the way, he should also be taught to indent the
commands within a -doto- loop, or any other kind of
loop, and those within the branches which make up
an if-then-else type of construct---simply for the
increase in readability this will get him.

        What I usually do in this situation is put a notice
on the title page of the lesson stating that development is
underway and that deletion is possible. Another author I
know has a flag he can set in the lesson's current version
which will display a "caution, author at work" message at
the bottom of the screen when he begins work. At least this
warns the users that they should expect to get deleted,
which is somewhat more considerate.

An even better way is to have a little flag set in a common

place that the person goes to a new main unit, the note

Can't the display simply give what unit the student
is in? Many times I have wanted something like this
so that I could see how long I had to wait before
recondensing. Most times, you might want to make
a change to a finished lesson that is not currently
being tested. In this case, the above "solutions"
would not apply.

Rick, that's no help. It isn't likely that the author is
a course director. It isn't even necessarily true that
all the students are in one course, or even that
all courses using the lesson are on the same site or
campus or part of the country.?
I think the suggestion would be very useful. I AM a
course director, and yet have had this difficulty often.
In the case of students using my lessons, they are likely
to be spread out over as many as a dozen courses (no
exaggeration!).

I agree. Nothing bothers me more than having to

being told that the inconsistency will remain,
because it would stop "a couple" of lessons from
working.

I am aware of the responsibility of the system to
keep lessons running, but there are many cases
in which a change wouldn't result in too much work
to make a lesson work correctly.

What's more, the system currently is making changes
that make our lessons stop working... so I can't
see any real difference from the status quo!

There seems to be an inconsistency operating at more than
one level here. The system personnel have, in the past,
made conversions with full knowledge that the conversion
would affect a subgroup of users in general. The usual
procedure is/has been to give as much advance warning as
possible. The warnings have typically been given a lot
of publicity with the assumption that the affected groups
are responsible for receiving and acting on the warnings.

1) we are all subject to from time to time 2) is overly

I say this because in the past people who adhered to
a particular belief for very good reasons, were unable
to communicate those reasons because my criticizm was
taken as a personal attack. The fact that we all are

Mike's and Tim Fay's arguments BOTH tend to support what
Jim is suggesting -- that while certain suggestions for
improvement in the system are rejected on the grounds that
the change "would affect or make obsolete existing lessons",
others which ARE implemented DO affect those same existing
lessons... See any foreign language programmer for num-
erous examples. This inconsistency in justification, in
my eyes, needs to be examined more closely -- perhaps the
next time something is needed but alters some current
convention, we can remember these facts.?
I'm afraid that I personally cannot provide relevant ex-
amples either for or against this point, since I've been
out of communication for so long. PLATO could well be a
main educational mode in the near future -- lets not make
it a confusion of inconsistency at the same time!

Well, there are literally thousands of hours of effort

on this system. For a change to come along which
simply makes some of them stop functioning is simply
out of the question, in my opinion. After all, an awful
lot of those authors are no longer on the system at all.?
If someone says to me "find all your lessons which
use command -x- and change them, because -x- is going
to work differently"...well, I don't even know where to
start looking in our 175 or so lessons! And even if I
do find -x- in one of these lessons, it may take me hours
of work to understand how the lesson works and rewrite it!

So, when changes are proposed, I don't object to
extending the language or even to changing it, IF
the changes can be made in such a way that properly
written, functioning lessons continue to function properly
(after an automatic conversion, if necessary).?
But I DO object to having to spend dozens of hours
going back over functioning lessons (whose original
authors are no longer around) to find and fix something
which has been working up to now.?
After all, this "experimental" system is ALSO very much
a production system. Or do you want all serious use to
cease until the language is "finalized"? NO language
is EVER finalized, in this imperfect world of ours.
But programs (lessons) DO have to continue to function
properly without being constantly rewritten.??

Altho there will always be disagreements about particular
cases, it was my impression that system policy in these
matters was balanced just about right. For example, the
changes by Larry White to the -circle-/rdraw-/etc. commands
originally were thought to entail fixing up lots of
lessons manually. They were to be implemented anyway
because of the tremendous advantages they provide. Notice
was given in a very responsible fashion, and, as far as I
know, authors generally approved. As it turned out, a
means was found to avoid obligatory manual fixing, which
demonstrates again that thought _is_ given to author problems
occasioned by change-overs. Admittedly, like the rest of
us humans, sysprogs vary in the amount of care and consider-
ation they show...and certainly some users have more clout
than others when they demand/resist a change...but overall,
the balance seems about right to me.

George: You are very right and the sysprogs must (and,
from what I've seen, do) make every effort to "automatical-
ly" convert existing lessons to the new format of the
given feature/command. The recent conversion of the
datain/dataout commands is one such example. In cases
where an automatic conversion is not possible (re: going
from "router" to "mrouter") systems support has been most
generous. The issue I think Bowery is raising, as pointed
out in the response immediately preceding yours, is what he
is interpreting as the "wrong" official reasons which seem
to be given for NOT implementing various changes.

not making a change." If I misinterpreted, ok, I back off.?
What I said earlier was not intended to be directed at any
person, but was meant to state a principle that I think
ought always to be kept in mind. So far, it is only
sometimes (but most of the time) kept in mind. In other

  I would like to reiterate a condition stated in my
original note. The reference to "general consensus"
was there for a very good reason. No one need remind me
that this is not a democracy. The definition of what is
"general, is pretty much a function of who the people
with the right signons are credulous to.

  This brings up the very important point of how decisions
are reached and what variables are weighted to what extent.
I would like to see information on this process made more
public. This would NOT make decision making a "democratic"
process. It WOULD give the "general" user population more
of an idea of what the dynamics are that mold the properties
of the computer space they operate in.

If you press SHIFT-STOP to reenter the queue, it places

The "loading condensEr" message means that the condensEr
is being rolled back in. Wait for it - you'll be next to
condense - automatically - after the condensEr is back.

        My question was not about how to reload the last
character set in lessons that I'VE authored. but in other
author's lessons. In my own lessons it's very easy indeed;
but what about when I'm running someone else's lesson in
which no such provision was made.
        If it isn't there already, there should be some
scheme for anyone using PLATO to do this--students as well
as authors. Perhaps another -term-, ...hmmmmm?....

A good standard to set up is not another system's term, but
a system-wide standard -term- "term" (or "terms") that will
display a list of the terms available to the user. Under
that list, then would be -term- "chars" (or whatever) and
an explanation that it will allow the user to reload the
the charset. This feature is VERY useful in loading a
charset for a person in monitor mode without having to clear
the charset flag, re-enter the lesson and then reload the
charset.
By the way, in order to save some code, it is nice to have
unit    char
term    char
charset
do      charset
press   back

This way unit "charset" may be used in other places.

I tried the following and it worked ok for me:

arrow  1010
answer ¬W=¬X=¬Akl7h $$ ¬W=¬X=¬A is font here, for readability

If you keep the "-" in answer command, you'll keep
getting that condense error since TUTOR doesn't like
authors to use punctuation like that in answers.

As for enlarging Cyrillic characters, you should
investigate the "lineset" feature. In a nutshell,
PLATO doesn't expand them automatically because sized
writing is actually line drawings. If you and this
character. in altfont, how should PLATO interpret it
for a large size? A box? A tiny x? Two horizontal
bars? Two vertical bars?

The regular characters can be sized because the system
programmers made up a set of co-ordinates for PLATO to use.

       The command
answer ¬W=¬X=¬Dkl7h-
will never work as long as the - sign is in the tag.
(Once again, ¬W=¬X=¬D stands for the font code.)
      You can get around this in two ways, either
exact ¬W=¬X=¬Dkl7h-
(exact will accept - signs, but will not mark up
spelling or capitalization errors), or
put    -=ab
answer ¬W=¬X=¬Dkl7hab
(changing the - sign to a legal group of characters
before hitting the answer match.)
        If this is a new foreign language charset.
I would suggest _most_ strongly=====__=________ that you not put

Incidently, the Cyrillic charset used my the Russian
lessons at Urbana was designed to use the "-" for the
so-called 'soft sign', because there are 33+ letters
in the alphabet,and because of the frequency of occurance
of the 'soft sign' which suggested a convenient key
location. Thus far, the Russian programmers have
satisfactorily worked around the problem (but not
without some anguish).

How about this: a provision for automatically running

lesson 'batch',say, and specify the locations of his code,
data, etc. Then late at night the job would be automatic-
ally executed on a time sharing basis with the flesh-and-
-blood users that happen to be on. Something like this
would be very useful for those of us involved in laboratory
applications of PLATO or, of course, anyone who needs a fair
amount of computation but can afford to wait if he doesn't
actually
have to sit at the terminal. It is also a way to use back-
ground time (that now mostly serves the midnight gamers) in

I agree that this would be very useful.

As for Judy's objection: the people who would use such a
feature would just have to be aware that there are certain
risks. If you have a "batch" program (i.e. a program that
does nothing besides calculations and data manipulations)
that runs for more than a few minutes, the problem of system
crashes is something you have to worry about whether you're
sitting in front of a terminal watching it run or whether
the program is activated automatically.
(continued in next response)

---------- response 4
  02/05/76     11.31     guerra       uimc

For example, I have a batch program that takes from 5 to i5
minutes to run. The way I activate it is to sign all 10 of
our terminals into the lesson and let them run. The output
from the program has to be completely accurate, i.e. no data
can be skipped and no data can be processed twice. It
has cost me much sweat to make sure the program can always
pick up where it left off, if it is interrupted either by
a backout or a plain old hard crash.
   Thus, from my standpoint, there is nothing to lose
and something to gain. I'm going to run my programs anyway.
Shall I arrange to have it done in way that is convenient
both for me and for the system? Or shall I continue doing
it in my present way, which uses as much of the system's
resources as 10 terminals can grab, as opposed to the amount
the system can actually afford and feels like allocating to
the task?

         It would seem that these people wanting batch

of the monitor, the operating system (the present OS is
marked for extinction in the not-so-distant future, as
mentioned in "projects".) and file structures, which the
designers of PLATO would prefer invisible.
         Perhaps a controller - program could be devised,
that signs on terminals automatically, and re-signs them
in upon system-bringup. I understand a program similar
to this exists, but works mainly with non-extant (pseudo)

We do various batch jobs in-house (TUTOR-batch), but have
not gotten around to defining what a user -batch would
do--what impacts, what capabilities. There is of course
the further possibility of general batch, but that is
even farther away (aside from in-house batching which we
have always done).

Some other systems have what they call 'pseudo-terminals'
which are artifacts of the operating system that look like
terminals to the jobs running on them. Input is done by
having a different job press keys on the 'terminal' and
output is done by the driving job reading the output
buffer. On a system I used this allowed one to do simple
batch processing without much of a change to the OS.
With Plato's graphics abilities, the saving of the output
would probably be difficult/impossible, but the input
should be feasible (since -press- already exists) and
a running program can always avoid doing output by storing
all results in a dataset/common.

         As a would-be plato number-cruncher, much of this
discussion interests me but it also leaves me puzzled.
         Would't a batch job be run as a separate job from
plato (under NOS) and thus be unaffected by plato crashes?
Or isn't this a multiprogramming environment like, say,
IBM's OS/MVT or /MFT?
         Anyway, my preference would be APL to FORTRAN--
much more compact and POWERFUL! (except for complex numbers)
         Pardon me if my ignorance of CDC hardware and
program products is showing, but the only exposure I've
really had with them has been through plato (which provides
a ____====very distorted view).

system architecture through assemblers to how plato "works"

initiatable on the DEC-10 and simliar systems exist on this

type of service already performed (such as the "autosignon"

the "fake" ones.

since there would definitely NOT be enough time to allow

a)   The systems staff would not lose much sleep over tutor-
style batching (once the software was modified to handle
it). The burden would be upon the individual requestor of
tutor-batch jobs to program his job to run w/o human inter-
vention and w/o mods to the existing tutor structure.
b)   These types of jobs would probably NOT be guaranteed
any different priority than ordinary, human-type users
during non-prime time, They would probably be guaranteed
no more cpu than the avg user and I'm sure the systems staff
would not want to implement the feature if it meant not
interrupting tutor-batch jobs currently running.

As on other systems, the bulk of the responsibility for the
job running properly, given the constraints of the system,
is upon the user him/herself.

We do have the capability of running repetitive batch jobs

         From the discussion so far I infer there may be
quite a few users who need batching. I'd like to send up
the following trial balloon,mainly as something to be re-
placed by an improvement.
         A TUTOR program with a name like batcher accepts
jobs during the day by storen-ing and storea-ing data and
code locations. A batch big board,so to speak, would pro-
vide feedback on the statuses of previously submitted jobs.
At night a phantom terminal signs on and executes the pro-
cessing part of batcher. The 'use' command, generalized
to accept a variable string as tag, lets the job appear to
PLATO as part of lesson batcher. All results are stored in
datasets. Protections against interruptions might be limited
to detection of the interruption and starting over on the
interrupted batch. I think even I could program that much
protection into batcher-- the user could then forget about

crashes altogether. A clever programmer could probably
provide more efficient protection by requiring some simple
flags be included in each batch's code.

to my basic ignorance of programming and this system. I

         I think the idea by jmckown is both practical and
desirable. An auto-signon terminal(possible puesdo terman-
al) would sign a student into a router. From the router
the student would jumpout to lessons execute the code,
return, set a flag and jumpout to the next lesson etc..
         If the system crashed while executing the lesson
the "student" would jumpout(restart) in the same lesson.
would be up to each user how his lesson would deal with
the crash.
         The router and the bigboard lessons should be
easy to write give existing features of anything. This
system would not require any managemen by operators.
         The only effect this system would have on current
users is to transfer some primetime demand to nonprimetime.

(Hope you don't mind a non-system response.) The existing
machinery can meet such a need. A special function key
can be made active in all units (one of the -op type keys,
for instance) which would do nothing to the current
display but would execute an -output- into the datafile
with the "baseu" and Mainu" information, along with some
student info (perhaps an -outputl- showing relevant values
in the bank variables).

Along the same lines, the institution of the much talked
about -termop- would do the same thing without tying up one
of your function keys and would thus minimize the amount
of existing code which would have to be re-written.

Finally, the institution of an on-screen student notes
type system (if it is being considered and if it ever comes
about) would do nicely.

There's no way you will get the file name of a lesson into

be necessary. I think a term -zproblem- or some such

would be valuable for reporting errors, and give away
nothing that isn't available by other means.

Until the systems people get moving on this, you can help

are worried about appearance):

at     101 $$ or other appropriate position
write  "lesson identifier"/

This will give the student a way to identify the lesson

Silver: if you are referring to the suggestion I make in
my first response when you say "there is no way to get the
lesson file name with such a term feature" you are only
half right. The -output- itself does not specifically
record the current lesson in the datafile, but the other

Alternatively, the file name could be the first 10 chars
of the tag to the -output-. It's really up to the way the

problems in your own lessons have many, comparatively easy

someone else's lessons. You'd like to have the errors fixed
so your own students would cease to have trouble, but the

Well. It's probably the "not enough ecs", I guess.
Thanks to those who made suggestions.?
The request for more information than "errtype" gives
is a very good one.?
Aids says that errtype=3 means not enough memory. How
does this differ from "not enough ecs"? Is Aids wrong??
If true, I wish Aids listed "not enough ecs" as a
cause of errtype=2. It's very misleading to consider it
just another condense error, since a fatal condense error
usually implies something wrong with the lesson.

I made a test router and sent a student through.
and when there wasn't enough memory for a -jumpout-,
errtype was indeed 3, both with and without an
-inhibit jumpchk- command.

I stand corrected... Not enough ECS is a fatal
condense error. but is reported to the router with
a different errtype.

Another possibility is "Condensor unavailable".

errtype:
0: pre-execution for jumpout command
    start of condense
1: execution error
    output buffer overflow/illegal action request
2: fatal condense errors of type other than 3
    missing unit on two argument jumpout!
3: condense errors of certain types
4: exec error in finish unit
5: stop1 out of condense queue after 30 seconds.

The following "condense" errors have returned errtype=3:
  No ECS, but still within site allocation
  Lesson Deleted
  No room in ECS for common
  Lesson tables full (unlikely)
  Site memory allocation exceeded

"lesson deleted" is applicable as a "memory" error
only for authors, so on the next version of Plato,
this will return errtype=2, not 3. This should
remove one occurance of incorrect errtype=3 errors.

Eh-heh. Yes, it is a problem, and we have considered
making the lesson of the type which registers only 1500
wds of ECS (much like Aids or the editor). We can still
do this, but we are really wary of aggravating the ECS
shortages by adding still another couple of thousand words
to the already large ECS overhead.

This was the subject of a debate some time ago ( a couple

that since the condensor did not really "condense"
the spelling was up to those who implemented this piece

Therefore you are not assured of the nit pick award.

Yes, it was felt that we could invent a word if we wanted
too. On the other hand, after much research I have
concluded that one should not invent this particular word,
and the normal senses of "condense" are not so different

in my own work, and hope to see it propagated.

I really don't think it's worth it. I think that would make
the top of the line edit page irritatingly crowded. And
furthermore, I can think of only a few cases where you
would get to the line edit page without knowing you're
in INSPECT ONLY mode, so it would mean we would have to
put up with an irritatingly redundant INSPECT ONLY message
on the line edit page in the 98: case, as against the 2:
of the time when it is useful. After all, if you're in

Sweet Mother of Mercy! I have prayed for this feature for
months. Last time I talked to Paul about this he didn't
know if it were possible, and it would be a year before it
could be done even if it were. At least one other systems
person said the entire theory of the -vocabs/concept-
structure made it impossible because the hashing procedure
employed at condense time threw away information needed to
decide what words were in the -concept- and what words,
therefore, were not, and could be used to ignore extra
intra-vocabs words not relevant to the particular -concept-
being processed at any one moment.

With a -specs okextra- that worked on -concept- you could
do some real natural language processing!

The present system is very difficult to use because of

An example could be: if non-scheduled then check ecs for
room, check if any open terminals left (we get non-sched
users hogging terminals often).

check if ecs available (if not delete non scheduled users).

         one terminal open for a possible scheduled

         one, he is allowed on only if he is on the

         is informed that he will have to leave to make room
         for the class. this way no one is going to the
         operator complaining that there isn't a terminal.

         you can determine the person to kick off, by ecs
         usuage.lesson in,etc.

         i have also seen cases of where scheduled students
         cannot get into their lessons because of the ecs.
         many do not know(or don't care) that they could
         complain to the operator about it.

It is clear that managing the ECS at a site takes a lot
of time that could be better spent doing other things.

The basic scheme which I use is simple enough that it
might be possible to have it done automatically. Basically
if there is plenty of ECS, let all students work. When
the difference between current ECS and used gets to less
than n, a parameter set by site director, the temporary
site restrictions are turned on. When this ¬? gets to be
less than n?1 (n?1<n), students not on the temporary list are
backed out. Of course, there has to be a time lag or
damping factor to keep the system from oscillating. Checks
about every 8 minutes might be about right.

Site management is no longer just a matter of allowing
certain courses and rejecting the others:

We may have 5 students scheduled from one course,
30 for another, 10 for another, and want to leave
the rest of the terminals open for students in
30 other courses. It is awfully hard to count,
check against a list of scheduled students, and
kick off the rest - and restrict some people in
a course where 5 or 10 others are allowed to run.

If this could be done automatically....

It is clear that something is needed. One obvious
improvement would be to let site directors specify when
"temporary" restrictions should be invoked. We do have
a difficult time seeing how to write a program to do
all of the things McNeil is asking for. Perhaps his
solution would work, if it could be accomplished: that is,
turn this programming job over to the individual sites.
Of the various options, I would think the most difficult
(impossible?) would be to check a jumpout. And I gather
that a router is not quite what is wanted -- rather
a program interposed between lesson "plato" (getting
name/course/password) and wherever one wanted to go (router,
author mode, etc.).

(Or complement those lessons.) I like the simplicity and
ease of operation inherent in Bruce's suggestion of
merely allowing the site director to specify certain
parameters whose values must be met before the temporary
site restrictions are automatically switched on or off.

(Changing the temporary list manually every hour or so is
a pain and conceivably the "leslist" type of suggestion
could be implemented: reading the temporary list out of a
pre-established list (or lists) of course/user types allowed
currently. But I'll settle for the "automatic turning on
of the temp list.)

Automatic temp list wouldn't help us here - It would have to
include a backout of courses not on the temp list.
As for changing the temp list every hour - one could have
a 64 word block(dataset) for each hour.

I really have no sympathy with requests such as this.
If the lesson is liable to be recondensed, it shouldn't
have users in it at all. It is super-simple to put a
"lock" on a lesson to keep people out while you are working.

Barring that, it is simple, via one single flag in a common,
to put an "about to re-condense" message in an -imain-.

Sorry Judy, but I like the request. Take for example

had to recondense. There was someone in it. So, he
had to do a term talk and ask him to leave. I have had
to do similar things myself. It is a pain one way or

The problem is more prevalent in non-instructional service

    It is an even larger problem when one cannot perform
a talk -talk- to the user, such as a multiple or student
signon. In that case, one must either wait until the
student/multiple leaves (which means wasting time sitting
on the "who's in the lesson" page of -edit- or taking
your chances by going someplace and then stopping by once
in a while with a STOP1 in your lesson to see if they
have indeed left yet) or forget about re-condensing.

   Unless of course you are supposed to have the change
code to the course the student/multiple is in and you
could monitor him and ask him/her to leave temporarily.

This would be a great help in making code readable.
For example being able to say:

   keytype a, ,?ˆ,?,x,y??

At the moment only function keys have names (keys whose
keycodes are >o200).
"square", whose name is (gasp!) micro1, is a function key
just like COPY.

Square1, CR, sup, sub, etc. do not have names, because they
are not function keys, but rather keys which insert an octal
code into the internal string.
square1 ONLY inserts an o76 into the internal character
string, whereas MICRO causes a table look-up which _may_
or may not cause an o76 (usually + other characters) to
enter the internal character string.

It is useful to understand these distinctions, especially
since CR ¬A¬D TAB and MICRO ¬A¬D FONT are typed using the same
keys, but are different _types_ of keys.

If square1, sub, CR, etc. were given names, it would
become doubly important to understand this distinction.

---------- response 5
  02/06/76     10.40     judy       pso

in passing....

The name "micro1" for the square key was removed from
AIDS when the function keys were shifted around. (Do you
remember trying to get used to the new location of ERASE?
I think that long ago, "square" WAS micro1 and "square1"
was font1...?)

Clearly, "micro1" is not an appropriate name for square
and Blomme said he planned to remove it. But one can't
just _remove_ features from TUTOR, so we merely took it off
the list. Probably square should now be named square.

I think you should regard "micro1" as being an unstable
name....

   Summary: some of the names are a mess; you know
it and we know it, but there are several snarls involved
that make the amount of work necessary far greater than
that needed simply to add a new key name. It will take
(1) a determined person
(2) several days of re-doing the whole business
  for changes to get done...in all likelihood this may
not happen for quite a while, but the naming problems
are known and noted.

The preceding discussion (public note 387) and the "limits"
discussion (sys notes, 9/24/74) have brought to mind what
is currently a fairly acute problem. (I recommend users in
general review the "limits" discussion of 9/24/74...it is
illuminating.) This note assumes the reader has read the
above references.

Lesson authors and the instructors responsible for directing
student use of PLATO curricular materials seem to have lost
sight of the fact that efficient use of the PLATO system
cannot be made when a number of students are assigned
a number of different lessons (intentionally or by default
because of self-pacing). This is one reason it _seems_ many
times that we must be running on half-ECS. To para-phrase
the "limits" discussion referenced above "completely in-
dividualized instruction cannot be promised/projected at
this time". (-LAB-)

---------- response 1
  02/06/76     10.59     fay       o

As many site directors are currently painfully aware,
students who must complete a large number of PLATO assign-
ments on their own time (ie, w/o reserved terminals) fre-
quently run into the problem of lack of ECS. The reason,
of course, is the rate at which ECS is used up when a large
number of different lessons are in use. This is very
frustrating to the student and no less frustrating to the
site director who tries to accommodate them.

My recommendations to all instructors are: A) As far as
reasonably possible, attempt to arrange the use of the
same lesson by several students at the same time. It is
quite easy with the system router to make up a new index
weekly with only one or two lessons available to the stu-
dents. B) As far as reasonably possible, reserve terminals
for use by your students and exhort them to make good use
of this reserved time. (-LAB-)

---------- response 2
  02/06/76     11.04     fay       o

There is no reason that course directors should be ignorant
of the limits on system resources (these are known and are
available on-line). In many cases, course directors can
(and should) make a greater effort to use the available re-
sources in a more efficient manner, Your students will be
less frustrated and will get more out of their PLATO
curriculum.

        The last time you were on the system, probably
you received, and deleted some notes, leaving you with
none.
        The system then crashed, and your records were

   Did any of you fabulous people out there in platoland
ever try to rewrite a calcc that spanned several lines???

If, per chance, you have, you may have noticed that when
the arrow shows up for the corrected line-o-type, it is
placed on the _very_ next line after the calcc command.
   This would be all fine and dandy except for the fact
that whatever you type at the arrow will be obscured
by the second line of the calcc.
   I dont mean to be picky or anything, its just that
it gets awful hard to edit a line if you cant even
read it. I would be eternally grateful if this horrendous
problem were to be fixed.

This problem is even much worse for those of us that tend
to use the ever-much-faster C¬=vR to reach the return point
set by the arrow. To have a list of index-letters imple-

if you have a 2-part lesson, and all blocks are condensable,
and you just want the 1-a and 2-g blocks condensed? There
is no way to control what blocks in a different part of a

going to work here.

  Perhaps pressing "P" should take you to a page and arrow
structure like the page in terminet where you select which
blocks to print. This would take longer to plot and to
select, but you could see all blocks at once.

  Alternatively, it could made available on some other key,

I want to partial out all blocks except one or two, and
I do not want to have to wait forever to see my whole

    I do favor the elimination of the help information

done at the end of marking the blocks.

if, for instance the student types an "a", the computer

What i'm trying to do is initiate judging if a person
hits ', set a flag that he has pressed it, and -judge
exit- so he can finish typing. The problem is, if I
map the ' into some jkey'ed function key, the ' never
appears in the judging copy, and i can't detect where
the person typed '. If i could assign "'", funct. key
to the ', it would work fine. Is there any solution
other than

I guess the main problem is that the current format of a
micro table does not readily allow for that. If the micro
contains normal characters, they are left justified in the
micro table. If it contains a function key, it is right
justified in the slot (try the LAB option in the micro
editor). If the slot is empty, it contains 000. How would
you combine the two things and still have an easy to decode
format? A possibility would be:
   0010200000000000202
for 'ab' NEXT. This would be more of a pain to decode so
you don't really want to do that for each keypress unless
there is a real need.

         The new -packc- command is real nice, but wouldn't
it be more consistant to have the first variable be the
character count and the second variable be the packed
string? It will be confusing to remember which command
(-pack- or -packc-) has what order.

---------- response 1

Maybe old 3-argument pack commands should be converted?
Now that there are so many string-oriented commands
with arguments of the form "address,count", it might make
sense to change the old -pack- format. What do people
think?

That's right.

The executor knew only how to handle variables for the
first and third tag, but the condensor allowed any
expression. So that you would know it wouldn't be
done correctly, the condensor was changed to give
you a condense error on such things.
(In your example, it would be very unlikely for it
to execute correctly!)

The first and third tags must be variables on putv.

         Suggestion for programmer of -setperm- and -randp-,
why not have a -restore- command that would replace a number
in the same manner that -remove- removes a number, in both
the setperm and modperm lists? I have just written code
to do just that in the 2-argument setperm in lesson
iu10, and know that it is not that difficult. The general
user would find it helpful in constructing a permutation
quiz. since it would allow an option to skip over an item
entirely and return to it later in the run.

---------- response 1
  02/08/76     22.48     blomme       s

    That is a possibility; I would note however that
remove does not operate on both lists but only the
"modperm" list and not the list currently in use.
Perhaps what might be useful would be a simpler way
to initialize a list with entries "missing" than is
currently possible (presumably one does a setperm,
removes the desired items, then does a modperm if using
the system kept lists). I'd be interested in other
examples and other problems in this area.

---------- response 2
  02/09/76     10.55     judy       pso

I think one would want the -restore- to balance with
the -remove-, i.e to modify only the -modperm- list.

  02/09/76     02.55     dave fuller       uimc

       I thought the descriptions in AIDS were a little
more clear. The actual error means that you do not have
a dataset attached at the time of i/o request. You should
ALWAYS check "zreturn" after a file is attached to see
if all goes well ("zreturn" < 0) to avoid this error, and
make absolutely sure that files are re-attached after a
jumpout to another lesson.
       Perhaps the AIDS descriptions could be made more
point blank at the very beginning of the datain/out,
and dataset discussions.

I recently asked for help in interpreting some errtype=2
error returns to my router (note¬$288). As one of the
replies, Larry White very nicely tabulated the various
things which cause errtype=3 (thanks, Larry). A copy of
his response is below:??
*response* 02/06/76  16.44  white  p?
The following "condense" errors have returned errtype=3:?
  No ECS, but still within site allocation
  Lesson Deleted
  No room in ECS for common
  Lesson tables full (unlikely)
  Site memory allocation exceeded?
"lesson deleted" is applicable as a "memory" error
only for authors, so on the next version of Plato,
this will return errtype=2, not 3. This should
remove one occurance of incorrect errtype=3 errors.??
(Discussion continued in first response. Press LAB.)

---------- response 1
  02/09/76     10.48     friedman       csa

Now, the point of this note is that **** "lesson deleted"
case. I used to give a message in my router that warned
the student getting errtype=3 that either there is not
enough memory, or the author is working on the lesson.
This was confusing, so I took it out. But it would be no
more helpful to have to say "either there is something
wrong with the lesson, or the author is working on it just
now." What I think we really need is a new value of
errtype, or some other way of distinguishing this case.?
Again, I second the suggestion (made in the past on several
occasions) that system variable errtype does not return
enough information; certainly, it does not return nearly
as much information as is available to the system.?
(Continued in next reply; press LAB.)

---------- response 2
  02/09/76     10.51     friedman       csa

It seems to me that errtype=2 ought to imply that there is
something wrong with the lesson and that errtype=3 ought
to imply that ECS (in total, or site, or tables, etc.) is
short. Otherwise, how does one go about correcting an
error, or even deciding whether there is an error to
correct? (I -output- the error situation to my datafile
just so that I know what my students are getting and so
that I can correct errors in lessons.)
And how does one give any reasonable message to the
student??
How about it....please?

I agree -- the present designations are sufficiently
confusing that consultants cannot deal with them.

I would also like to see a separate errtype value designated
for the case of no problem (ok), as opposed to the present
value of 0, which makes it indistinguishable from the case
of an unknown problem.

---------- response 4
  02/09/76     13.09     friedman       csa

It would be consistent with "usual" Plato usage for the

The new group notes feature is very nice, however since
the PLATO system is used mainly for classroom instruction
I wonder if these new note features can be used with
the system router to provide the long promised system
level note features which would allow students to send
comments on lesson material to instructors and lesson
authors.

Since there has never seemed to be a shortage of ways for
users of the UI PLATO IV system with author records to
communicate with each other, I assume that making it
possible for students to send notes to instructors and
lesson authors has a higher priority than communications
between other user types.

       We are using groupnotes with the iudemo router
to store student comments. However, students have been
long used to using a notes-type file, now found in
lesson indiana, and I would like to see them continue
to do so. I am not sure how the complexities of
group notes will affect students not used to using a
notes file.
       To see how to connect group notes to a router,
see the third page of help in "notes", from the page
which asks "What group notes file?"

We have had very good luck with the law student notes

group notes setup seems to me to be too hard to use for
such non-computer-oriented types as law students.
(Our law student notes contain extensive how-to-use
explanations on the screen at all times.)

We do begrudge the high ecs charge for running our
own notes file, and would agree that there should be
a high priority on a notes file usable by computer-naive
students.

We also use a special notes file for our computer-naive
classroom teachers. The main page looks much like any
other notes file, but long experience has shown us the need
to (1) jump a teacher directly to insert mode on the
write-a-note page, (2) automatically label the note for
the teacher when she indicates the note is complete.

Groupnotes would serve us well if it had these features

I have been hoping to use "groupnotes" facilities for a

class discussion: students would enter short essays assigned

Hinton, you radical. It should be obvious that such
student-to-student communication falls outside of the
traditional plato notions of "classroom instruction".
What are you trying to do anyway, get your students so
actively involved with the material that they need to
think? I guess you realize some of the implications of
this direction of your efforts. These sorts of facilities
could be extended to allow geographically-dispersed
conferences an nearly any academic subject. Input from
outside experts could effectively destroy the provincialism
that governs so many universities. Better get back to
more traditional activities, before it is too late.

---------- response 8
  02/09/76     17.33     blomme       s

  The communications between students and lesson
authors and the provision for "groupings" of people
to inter-communicate have BOTH had highest priority
for quite some time (in the sense that each has had one
person devoting full time to its implementation). Neither
is the sort of project completed overnight; as it happened,
the months of work to produce a finished product were
completed first in the case of the group notes.
   If the generality of the group notes structure makes
possible (albeit less than conveniently) some start
towards the other problem, please view that as fortuitous
and not as either an improper solution of the problem or
lack of interest in it. I think that the students
comments handling may yet be quite some weeks off, so
people should not be expecting such a facility to appear
right away.

I just ran a test unit and found that indeed -erase-
DOES reset "where". Until a couple months ago it DIDN'T.
Or rather, it used to set system variable "where" to
the beginning of the erase area, but it didn't send the
corresponding -at- to the terminal. So if you then wrote
something with no -at-, the writing appeared AFTER the
erase area, but if you did an "at where", the writing
appeared at the beginning of the erase area.

There was much discussion in notes, but apparently no
"system features note".

There are two symbols commonly used
1) The caduceus (symbol of Mercury, messenger of the gods
and the underworld [not the mob, the other one]) which has
two snakes around a winged staff. This one is used by the
military medical services and some others.
2) The staff of Aescapulus (symbol of the god of medicine)
which has a single snake around a forked staff. This one
is used by the AMA and some others.

There's an interesting bug in the -packc- command.
Consider the following code:

packc  prob,text,length
       They aren't
       Apples aren't
       Mary and John aren't

According to the advertised behaviour of the command,
each new line should be a new condition. However,
tests show that the following is the case:
        _prob_ _length_ _text_
        -1      2       T
         0      10      ey aren't

         2      13      Mary and Jo
         3      9       n aren't
After careful scrutiny, I discovered that the "h" in
"length" (the final character in the line) was ALSO
being taken as a delimiter!                     (huh?)

I like the consistency of the idea of having the index of
Pnotes! This would allow a much quicker method for finding
the note that one wishes to read. The present method, one
has to page back and forth, which certainly must be taking
unneccessary cpu time (and possibly disk accesses?).

The major factor against the change would be that people
would use it as a storage place more readily since they
would not need to page through the notes. This need to
page causes one to delete as fast as possible.

Regretably, it appears that many of the new GNOTE files

put all non-recognized authors on write-only basis. In
some cases this is appropriate, but I think it's a bad
policy to adopt in general since it tends to isolate author-
ing groups. One of the ways which some authors use to
keep in touch with the activities and concerns of other
groups is by reading their notesfiles and commenting once
in a while. This function is thwarted by excessive access
restrictions.

  According to AIDS:
"Attempts to excecute more than one -press- per second are
automatically slowed down by the system."

  Now, this seems perfectly reasonable and safe to me.
BUT... Why do we poor folk trying to accomplish something
legitimate with press have to have that inherent pause?
What I'm saying is, slowing more than one press/sec is
fine. but why slow the first one? Oftentimes, a press
is the only way to get around some problem (especially
since there is no way to initially enter judging except
by a -press next-... hint hint hint), and the pause
is a royal pain. Couldn't there be some check put in
so that the pause is inserted ONLY if the user is trying
to excecute more than the legal amount of presses?

       I too would like a "faster first -press-", but
pressing NEXT is not the only available method of entering
judging. In fact, if you want to force judgment, it is
faster to use: -time 0.75-,
even though AIDS gives: -press next-
as an example of lesson-initiated judging in its description
of -loada-.

        If you want the student to initiate judging in some

  02/09/76     17.57     elston       rhrc

The collect command is nice but there are still a few things
that might make it more useful. For instance,

-something like -jkey-, that is, some other way to terminate
input other than time intervals or exact key count.
-something like "jcount" if the above is implemented.
-something like the -keys=x- feature of -pause- to eliminate
unwanted keys. of course. this can be done with a loop but
it would seem simpler to throw it away at the system level.

If these things would _greatly_ degrade the input capability
then they should not be considered but if they do not
require too much overhead then they would be nice.

Suggested format:
collect start var,count,jkey1,jkey2,,,jkeyn,keys=x,x,x

Example:
collect n1,10,touch(0,0),ext(n11),keys=touch,ext

  02/09/76     18.51     blomme       s
   Several different things are being considered in
the way of expansion of the capabilities of the command.
The first is likely to be something of the form "keys="
to limit the keys accepted. Also a way to specify
other means of termination is being explored. Unfortunately
it appears that certain limitations in space will prevent
implementing something as general as an "endkeys=" type
construct. One alternative might be the specification
of a single additional "endkey" in addition to the standard
terminators. The ability to specify segmented variables
to store into has also been considered. Since we seemed to
have a useful basic form (and since the main goal was
to reduce the computing overhead), we have released the
command in its current basic state. Implementation of
any of these other niceties may be some time off.

---------- response 1

       The only way I know of would be to merge the

the terminal. If you need more than 128 characters,
than there is just no way around loading one character
set and then the other.

---------- response 2
  02/09/76     19.26     rick       mfl

If you wouldn't be doing too much writing, you could
do the following--

  * Load the charset for the pictures you'd need
  * Load a Russian alphabet Lineset
  * Plot all your pictures in -size 0- (this will give
    you the altfont chars you loaded)
  * Plot all your Russian in -size 1- (this will cause
    the system to use the lineset).

If you need to do a lot of writing, this isn't quite
as satisfactory, since -size 1- writing takes so much
longer than -size 0-.

---------- response 3
  02/10/76     08.13     berger       mfl

Just so you know:

There is a HARDWARE limitation, inherent to the terminal,

---------- response 4

Within the 128 character limitation, if it HAPPENS
that
1) all of your letters reside in slots 1-64 of charset A
2) all of your pictures are in slots 65-128 of charset B
THEN
you can (quite legally and successfully) say
charset mylesson,A
charset mylesson,B

Notice that
1) you still only get 128 characters total
2) each time you encounter the two charset commands
(as in an ieu). you will reload both sets.

       You might also consider drawing your _pictures_
with a lineset. With pictures, the slower plotting of
-size- >0 is much less noticable, and there are
already Russian charsets on the system (I'm not sure
about linesets).

  Look at lesson rfly, where Paul Tenczar got around the
problem by only loading Russian capital letters, thus
leaving enough room in his charset for the graphic
characters. He then has a micro that types these
letters when the student types lower case.

  You can also take advantage of the fact that
a number of latin letters are the same as certain
cyrillic ones, e.g. MOCKBA, CCCP, to further limit
the number of characters you have to store, though
you will need a crazy micro to every write with
such a setup.

Something that we have done here in the past is to pull
only the letters that we needed (not even all the caps)
and the parts of the pictures that we needed into one
charset. If you overrun the 126 (2 unprintables) limit
by not more than a small number of chars, you could put
some in char commands and swap some characters in and out.

This may seem like a really strange idea, but with the
note a little while back about the -press- command I
thought I would bring it up:
How about a command that 'simulates' an -arrow- in that
it puts you in post-arrow state and enables answer and
all those nice commands, but rather than taking the string
from the terminal and displaying the arrow it would take
the string from student variables, for example:
        varrow str,len
A command like this, especially when combined with the
-answerv- command (if/when implemented) would make
scanning and manipulation of character strings very easy.
Consider for example how you could do a keyword search
in a notes lesson:
        varrow  keywd,len
        answerv whatiwant,len2
        jump    found

editor to a greater or lesser degree, where life could be
simpler if an -inhibit dropstor- had been available at the
author mode page.... And various other lessons, for storing
notes.... It seems a harmless request.

        I have repeatedly asked for this at the systems
level, and have been repeatedly told by the sysprogs:
        Forget it! No way,Charlie!=============================== ______ ___ __ ___ ______
        It seems that the save buffer appears in variable
storage beginning at word 644, and the length of the
storage is adjusted to fit the size of the save buffer
by commands available only to system lessons.
        It does seem that _something_ could be done along
these lines, though, if the sysprogs would only do it.

        There is a whole list of lessons that might
interest you, available under option "g" (author resources)
suboption "d" (other lessons) from the main index in AIDS.
This list includes lesson alarm, among others.
        The author resources section of AIDS is perhaps
the most complete listing of everything you might want to
know that there is, at any price. You can literally
spend days recursing into the depths of the AIDS system
from that innocent option.

Why is it that the defines of the following form are not
allowed? I use vertical segments quite a lot, and to have
the defines take up to two blocks of code seems a little
excessive! Parsing takes more time when the parser needs
to look for various options, but the changes should be no
more slow or costly than the present -change- command....

As I recall reading the AIDS description of the "change"
command I think it said to be used to change TUTOR commands
to their FOREIGN languauge equivalent. Now I would hardly
consider having s=segment do anything but confuse the
poor guy who has to follow the code that was written using
this incredibily cyrptic method of shortening your defines.
If the lesson is SO big in the first place to have 2-3
blocks of defines then maybe you should consider the
"use" command? Anyway, I definately say that implementing
suggestion that would be taking one BIG step backward in
trying to make TUTOR code more readable!

-change- is for COMMANDS

Ordinarily, -change- is used to modify the command names
to a foreign language. However, if you want to play,
you can -change- "next" ¬D "back" and "calc" ¬D "join"
and make a REAL mess!

I would think that if you made segment and vertical so that
you can use _either_
define segment,vertical,seg=nc1,1,20,s
$or$
define seg,vert,seg=nc1,1,20,s

then it would still be very readable, and it would cut
down on the coding that has to be used to use vertical
segments. It seems a waste looking down 15 lines of
code where I see segment, vertical on each of them....

Yes...to think you can put "s" instead of "signed" but
can't put "v" instead of vertical, when I seldom, if ever,
use "signed" segments but frequently have blocks and blocks
of vertical segment definitions.

---------- response 7

The other method that I left out was the seg,vert. It saves
two-four words per line of define depending on the option
left out. Just having two segments per line saves one word
per line.

The readability is not impared. It would be less wasteful
of system resources. The editor would go faster. I AM
VERY SHORT on disk space! Perhaps you arent, but many
people are and where every word counts...

one of my students who was using lesson 'wits' (editor for
BASIC) tried to run his program and got a message saying
that there was not enough ecs. Yet at that same time,
another student was running his program, which means that
theoretically the interpretor lesson, schwab, was already
in ecs and should not have had to have been condensed.

---------- response 1

Bill, each student already has storage, and moving
between lessons already at the site shouldn't cost
anything.

1) the lesson uses -lessin- to see if the lesson is
   already charged to the site, if so the jumpout is done.
2) if not already charged to the site, (mallot-muse) is
   checked to see if there is room for the known size of
   the compiler. if so, the jumpout is done.
3) otherwise a message is given saying there is not
   enough room.
Q: were both students at the same logical site?
If so, then I don't know what was wrong.

I have noticed that when someone is waiting to condense
his ecs charge drops to 0. During this short period the
mallot can fall and though you might have checked for
enough room before jumpout there may not be enough when
the condensor gets around to you. AL9000

---------- note 107 sys router
  02/10/76     11.28     hubel       ed

     Presently, an instructor who is using the system
router has no way of knowing: 1) how much time a student
spent in each lesson or 2) what portion the student did
before he chose another. The only information he presently
gets is an * if the lesson is complete, and a score which
is restricted to lie between -1 and 100. [This teacher
does not have access to the data file].

[Please refrain from commenting on how these 2 quantities
could be misunderstood by others--I am aware of that.]

     As a solution to this, could the number of bits
available for lscore in the rvars be increased in the
future to allow authors to encode more information in
them? I have received numerous requests for this type
of information from chemistry teachers who report that
it is very common for a student to spend an hour in a
lesson and never receive any credit at all since he
didn't finish it.

---------- response 1
  02/10/76     12.21     stan smith       chem

The U of I chemistry lessons are set up to give "credit"
for having learned the material well enough to complete
the lesson, not for just trying but not finishing the
program. More extensive data, taken from data files,
actually indicates little correlation between time in
a lesson and other measures of performance such as
errors or hour exam grades. Is the preposal to include
time in a lesson a solution to some other problem such
as loosing restarts in a lesson upon going into another
program such as a review lesson? Students often almost
finish a lesson, go into another one, come back and find
that PLATO doesn't "remember" the earlier but uncompleted
work, which doesn't please them.

Time in a lesson is interesting, but the problem for
which this is the solution in this case is in large
part loss of -restart- upon going to another lesson.
A problem not solved by time in a lesson. It would
help greatly if restart information on several lessons
could be kept by the system.

---------- response 4
  02/10/76     14.06     hubel       ed

There appears to be at least 4 reasons for wanting time,
fraction-of-lesson completed or similar information:

1) Students have elected to quit one lesson and begin
    another which resulted in the loss of the restart, and
    also their ability to eventually achieve the * without
    re-doing portions again.
2) Students did not have enough time during the scheduled
    session to finish that lesson and had to go on to
    a new lesson next time due to insufficient terminal
    time to catch up, without leaving a report of what
    they did in that lesson.
3) Teacher promised extra credit for spending a certain
   amount of time or completing a certain portion of a
   lesson.
4) Teacher just wants to know the current status of his
   class at certain times during the semester.

The system router is a real time-saver, however it should
have just a little more flexibility in lesson status.

Without intervening in the exchanges between stan smith/chem
and hubel/ed, I want to concur in the strongest possible
way with the comment made by john r/reading. Time-in-lesson
is a fundamental parameter which has economic importance as
well as theoretical significance. We need to understand the
variables that control it. To encourage attention to it,
surely a router provided by the system should report it.

Saving the -restart- info for several lessons would
be nice.
Also very useful would be the construct (discussed
before) of a lesson data area, which could be used
to function similarly and/or could be used to
pass parameters into the lesson.

Can there be room anywhere for all of these things,
or must some choices be made?

---------- response 7

At least one course that I know of (whose name I
shan't mention out of a decorous sense of humility,
besides which Roberta would kill me if I squealed)
uses "score" to pass information as follows:

The first digit of "score" gives the total score on
the first part of the lesson, and the second digit
gives the total score on the second part of the lesson.

I should imagine that one might subvert "score" more
cleverly to pass more information back and forth.

I should also imagine that systems would prefer
some form of parameter-passing to this sort of brouhaha.

---------- response 8
  02/10/76     19.42     chabay       s

We are worrying about this problem. Among the things
we're considering is keeping restart status for more than
just the last lesson a student worked (perhaps a stack
of 10 lessons), and possibly allowing more status to be
passed between the router and lessons.
        It isn't an easy problem, though. One of the
reasons the system router is economical is that it doesn't
use lots of storage or do disk accesses. And,
unfortunately, even system lessons can get only 60 bits
per word, and use 50 router variables. So it isn't easy
to keep lots of information without losing some of the
advantages the system router now has.
        This doesn't mean it can't or shouldn't be done -
having more restart status would help a lot of people,
and time in a lesson is certainly a reasonable thing to
want to know. (cont)

There may be other ways to save and present the same
information (for example, how about a system-level
"gradebook" into which an instructor could also enter
exam scores, etc.)
        Anyhow, we are thinking about these problems
(and this is a good time to suggest things you feel
are necessary in the system router.)

Speaking for the Community College math group, a record

valuable addition to the system router.
In a previous discussion of this issue, a number of reasons
were given for this position relating to the problems
of implementing and monitoring Plato use in a complex
and varied situation.
Also, for virtually every math instructor we have worked
with, time has been one of their major considerations
in planing their use of Plato.

Re: John D. Eisenberg's (sp?) suggestion about passing
arguments between router and tutor lesson---

There is a basic philosophical question which has not been
resolved (among systems staff and also users) about whether
or not lessons _should_ become so intricately tied to the
values of various parameters passed to and from the system
router. The issue boils down to modularity of lessons vs.
entire curricula. While you may pefectly legally pass
arguments via the router vars (rvars may be read via the
readr commands, but not written) the current systems posi-
tion seems to be favoring less router dependence in individ-
ual lesson design. This is reportedly so that users may
make use of "published/finished" lessons on a more modular
basis, picking and choosing in order to design curricula.

Don't feel too bad. We too are unhappy that we cannot

I know that this has been mentioned before, but I don't
recall seeing an answer...

Why can't a jumpout be made directly to a group notes
file, The check for file type is already made somewhere,
else one wouldn't get the "not a TUTOR lesson" message.

If it could be done this way, it would allow us to
preserve -n1-, and therefore allow us to use the
notefile for students.

One of the original "selling" points is that it
doesn't affect student variables, and in times
of short ECS, it would be nice to guarantee that
a student could always reach a notefile.

I wouldn't have to wait for the new student notefile
system if this one change were made.
Incidentally, if this change were made, the system
router could use the new group notes too!

That is more or less correct. The TIPS figure you usually
see upon leaving a lesson via STOP1 is an _average_ figure
over the entire time you were in the lesson. When you are
"in a lesson" for just a couple of msec this average is
very high, as noted, and should not be regarded as a very
meaningful figure.

Last Tuesday (2/3/76) a titanic battle was waged between the

those of the CDC program (prepared by this author). The out-

31 moves and 3-0 in 37). This despite always awarding the
first move to CERL and repeated attempts by the CDC program
to make things more interesting by gratuitously sacrificing
its material. Making the outcome even more unusual is the
fact that this author knows so little about the game that
only after he had written the program did he learn that a
checker's board is not set up like a chess board. In fact,
the current games were only possible because a checkers
board with numbers, colors and squares all backwards turns

Yes and no! The new terminal has been called a PLATO V
terminal, but that name may not stick. Whether it does or
not, terminals of that kind will be used on PLATO IV systems

PLATO V will be the name of the next PLATO system we design.
Its capabilities and architecture are as yet uncertain. One
goal is a modular design which will permit building
systems capable of runing a few hundred terminals per
module up to perhaps 10 or 12 thousand terminals. That is,
by adding a procesor and more memory, a system's
capacity would grow by 300-500 terminals.

---------- note 174 packv?
  02/11/76     12.55     michael       matha

A few months back, while speaking with a systems programmer,
I learned of the soon-to-be-released command "packc". It
has now been released, and is _fine_, but does not have all
the features that I was under the impression it would.
The feature I was interested in was the "embed" feature for
variables, in other words, the ability to pack the alpha of
a variable into a string, using "show,showo,showt" and
"showz", and thus preventing (minor) complexities involving
the use of itoa and move. For example, the code:
calc v1?¬p
packc type,string,count,¬0s,v1¬1,¬0t,v1,3.3¬1
would produce the results (depending on "type"):
string='3.14159', or string=' 3.141'.
I assumed a side effect would be release of "vtoa".
Are these features under consideration, soon-to-be-released,
or ridiculous? How about "packv"¬+"vtoa"?

It's simple to do with the existing structure:

---------- response 2
  02/11/76     14.46     putch       arizona

     I see how that could work if you simply wanted to
_block_ a particular key; however, I want the key to remain
active so that pressing it will perform its normal function.
Is there presently anyway of doing this, and if not, could
it be implemented?

---------- response 3
  02/11/76     15.06     michael       english

What do you mean by "perform its usual function"?
The "keys=all" structure permits enabled function keys to
behave normally. In the preceding example, if HELP had
been enabled, pressing the key would have transferred
control to the specified unit, not broken through the
pause.

---------- response 4
  02/11/76     15.54     putch       arizona
     Yes, but help is a branching key. It is the erase key
that I'm trying to get to work before a -pause-.

---------- response 5
  02/11/76     17.09     michael       english

Erase has no function at a pause, only at an arrow.
I don't quite see how it could since a pause is unrelated
to screen display, whereas an arrow implies screen activity.

---------- response 6
  02/11/76     18.16     putch       arizona

     Perhaps an explanation is in order. I have several
arrows separated by -pause- commands that occur just before
the -endarrow-. In testing it, I have found it convenient
to be able to press erase after a correct response and
restart the judging if it is required. However, the
introduction of the pause command prevents me from doing so.
Using the routine described by chabay/chem, I succeed only
in preventing the erase key from ending the pause, not in
restoring its function( and to anticipate an inevitable
suggestion, placing the arrows in separate units, at least
during the testing, causes all sorts of difficulties.)

---------- response 7

Question: (for further explaination of what you want?)
Does the following do what you want, only a little awkward:

arrow  1010
ok
pause  keys=all
branch key-erase,1end,x,1end
press  erase
noword
judge  noquit
1end

write  through

Does this do what you want? (not that I'll admit it is nice,
or for that matter ... I won't even admit I wrote that.)

---------- response 9

---------- response 10
  02/12/76     16.04     putch       arizona

     First of all, it does no good to put the pause after
the endarrow because it leaves no way to reenter the
judging. Second, I tried several forms of midden/p's
suggestion but I still didn't get quite what I was after.
Now I'm trying to find out if there is a nonexecutable
judging command(i.e. a command which will end regular
processing after another judging command, yet not be
executed in a judging state) so that I can allow the
"ok" to be printed before the pause occurs without putting
in an actual judging command which must, in some way I can't
figure out either, be neutralized when it is encountered
in the judging state.

very reliably for almost 2 years. A local company is
fabricating additional copies for us; they have agreed to

  There is some question here of appropriateness
(and not of difficulty). No listing of lesson names
is provided by the system. And when there IS effectively
such a listing provided by a lesson catalog, the only
lessons listed will be ones which the system can more
or less "guarantee" as to their existence and performance.
Whether some sort of user initiated flag setting similar
to the "on-system" list of users is appropriate here
is the issue.

---------- response 3
  02/11/76     23.11     david       cerlcc

Since the user actually executes "notes" it would seem
that the reliability of the gnotes code is already
guaranteed by the system.

And if the listing of gnotes files was in "notes" itself,
anytime someone tried to enter a gnotes file which did
not exist, that gnote file name could be dynamically deleted
on detection of the appropriate error code, no?

The current NSF funding for PLATO (and for the TICCIT
project) was for a specific purpose (the evaluation of
operating CAI systems). As is normal in such circumstances,
such funding terminates when the project is completed.
PLATO, at least, has funding from many sources so it is
not clear why the normal end of funding from a particular
source should be of major concern (unless you happen to
have been employed solely for that project). This is not
to say that the NSF support was not welcome and was not
beneficial to the interests of the educational community.

I sincerely hope that CERL does not incur a large funding

This would be VERY useful. I use very _small_ numbers
and the common editor shows 0.000 or such instead
of any significant figures. The only way to tell
if there is anything in it is to look at the octal
and that is hardly informative about the actual
value except when converted (not easily done in the editor).
The ability to see at least 3 or 4 significant figures

Hello all...
    Does anyone know anything about the ARPA net interface
with Plato? This interface was going to be set up at ILL-CAC
as part of the project to place Plato terminals on the net,
and was intended to enable them to communicate with Plato
via ILL-CAC as well as with all the other hosts... The
interface doesn't appear to be up, though. Its socket ¬$'s
on ILL-CAC were given as 164400 and 164401 (octal) in the
project documentation, but the project has been discontinued
since then. Does anyone know whether the interface is now,
or has ever been in working condition?
Thanks for any help,
Joseph H. Berkovitz

        Could I please get a satisfactory reply to
old help notes number 473? The crux of the matter is, that
if someone pages you, and then quits, you get the end of
talk message. Then, if someone else pages you, their name
replaces the previous name, but the end of talk message
stays, so you could have a page coming in, and not know it..
you'd just think to cal the other person later, instead of
inadverdently leaving him hanging on. How about an erase
for the space where the -end of talk- appears, or just a
full-line erase????

The Pnotes flag that is set whenever a pnote has been
sent to an author is a fast and simple reminder to read
the Pnotes. Perhaps a redefintion of that flag or an
additional "Variable-Gnotes Flag" would be posible that
could be set to the Gnote of the user's choice, signalling 
in the same manner as the present Pnotes flag. It would
be set whenever a note/response was written in that file.

You mean anytime anyone writes a note in any of the

is check it's list of the people who want to be notified
of that fact and nudge their flag?? Is that all?
Sure doesn't seem difficult, except for: where is this
list kept?...what will all the disk activity (to change
the people's flag in their records) do to system
performance?...Actually, if the system kept track of
all the Gnote files, and everytime one was changed, it 
noted the time, and then kept track of the last time
I had looked at the notes I had selected, it could
decide each time I went to the Author Mode page whether
I should be notified...but again, where does this list
of _all_ gnote file access dates get kept?
?

  It's a very simple matter, really... All you need to do
is read the records of EVERY SIGNLE SIGNON, see if he wants
to be notified, and if so, notify him. Easy, no?

And even sarcastically back, the access list already at-
tached to the gnotes file could contain that information.
The course records would be the storage place of the flag.
The course records disk access is already done on entry.
The setting of the flag is tested by checking the already
loaded access list....

Degrading the system's performance! BAH!

(I agree that checking every signon would be degrading)

*** Call For Articles ***

        Last May, several of us here at Cornell University
announced our intentions to start an on-line journal, which
would solicit articles from the PLATO community. Unlike
previous experiments in on-line "publication", we proposed
a monthly journal developed along the lines of the _Atlantic_
_Monthly_ and _Scientific_  _American_.

        Naturally, such a journal would have to maintain
strict editorial standards. Submitted articles would be
reviewed by the Editorial Board for suitability for
publication. We are exploring means of obtaining copyrights
on each issue of the journal.

first execute lesson "journal" to read about our submission
and publication procedures. Those wishing to submit arti-
cles should send me a pnote by 20 February. Please include  
some biographical information, and your real name. Articles
in the journal will be published under real names, not

This happened right before the crash at 2:20.
I was editing lesson bounce, and had pressed the ? key to
continue reading. At this point, the editor went crazy and
printed out 8 lines of Tutor text continously. When it
reached the bottom of the page, it started at the top.
There was no erasures of any find, the stuff just kept
printing. Nothing (including STOP1) would stop the display
or get me out of there. I finally turned off the terminal
(hoping to send an abort signal) and when I turned it on
again, it was down.
Anyone have an explanation?

I have had the same error many times before PLATO goes

tutor programs. I have had doto loops go crazy and keep

down.

   No, you probably flooded the system with keys and 
your terminal got "turned off"...trying to send keys
at over 10 keys per second is not advisable (and cannot
be supported now really) and over 20 keys a second is
absolutely impossible since the software only polls
stations for input 20 times per second. (Obviously
148 keys in 3 seconds is far far beyond the pale).

     I know that this isn't really needed, but it would
be a nice convience, term -time-. It shouldn't be that
hard to implement. I think it would come handy when you
are in a lesson, or the editor, and obvoiusly when there
is no clock abound. I also realize that if someone finds
this an acceptable suggestion it would be put way down on

     Here's a suggestion:

     Many people have, over the months, requested a
TEAM-ecs, which would display the current ECS utilization
at their site. There are plenty of good objections to in-
creasing the number of system -TERM-s, but there are also
valid reasons for authors to have ready access to this
information. Therefore, I suggest a flag on the Author
Mode Page which would say something like "ECS CRUNCH" when
site ECS utilization goes over 90 or 95:. This should be
simple to implement, and would be very graphic.

        Yes, but even if that were possible it would still
involve needless keypresses. I think most authors just
need to know that ECS is tight, not how many words are
actually available.

        By the way, experimentation shows that -at 196.344-
is a good location for the message "ECS CRUNCH".

No he hasn't. If I counted all the times that an author

that "E" display shows the relatively meaningless

overflow.

WHEN the "E" page shows the BASE alottment, THEN
Len's suggestion would be viable.

i think it isn't clear to everyone-- at least it wasn't
to me-- that the kind of questions which were once written
in "help" notes (ie: how do i get PLATO to do......)
should now be written in psonotes. perhaps it would help
to call psonotes "consultnotes" or "consultn".
*
a related issue is the learning value of helpnotes for
non-experts at TUTOR. pso notes can not be read by the
ordinary user. finally, there were also some benefits
-admittedly accompanied by problems-- to letting anyone
on the system answer the requests-- not just pso!
*
i realize that the same questions can now be asked in
"public notes" but i still feel that this degrades
public notes by dilution.
*
this, then, is a bid for the return to a system of
public help notes separate from "general" public notes--
psonotes would then be mainly for problems with "aids"

It is not the case that most of what went into helpnotes
should now go into psonotes. Rather, that belongs in public
notes. We do welcome qestions in psonotes, and they will
get prompt attention, but the intended purpose of psonotes
is to collect comments, questions, suggestions, and, if it
comes to that, complaints about the various PSO services.

I agree, that some questions and their answers serve to
educate the entire community and should be open to the
public. Use public notes.

Your guess that PSO instigated the change is wrong. No one
asked us, but personally, I favor the helpnote-general note

  Those things which were formerly to be addressed to

to jim/pso, should now be addressed to psonotes (unless, of
course they are personal communications). Likewise,
problems of a sensitive nature such as little-known ways
to hang the system, lesson names that ought to be kept
confidential, etc.. should be communicated via psonotes.
  General calls for help/attention are still best placed
in public notes.

i am having a bit of trouble explaining in a report why
PLATO has 1000 or so connected terminals (ports) which are
fully supported by the communications system between the
terminals and the computer yet if more than half try to
run, essential resources such as cpu and ecs become
in critically short supply. i am aware that most statistics
so far available show that only half of the users run at
one time but i need to know if it is true, as i believe,
that the system is philosophically committed to
supporting all users who have dedicated terminal connections
-- even if this is not practical at this time at the level
of service to which we are all accustomed.

---------- response 2
  02/15/76     23.44     avner       s

The seeming conflict is simply due to another point in the
philosophy of service--i.e., "give the user maximum access
to available facilities". It is indeed the case that
maximum expected usage is less than the full load (if memory
serves, one may be confident at the .999 level that no
more than 550 terminals will attempt operation at any one
time--given current experience). Rather than allocate all
resources so that everyone is limited to the quantity that 
would be available if all terminals attempted operation, a
more generous (if also somewhat less conservative) approach
is used. In addition, the mean amount of ecs used per
terminal has increased by about 1000 words since the last
expansion in ecs. It would seem that when a terminal is
in use, there is simply a tendency to make maximum use of
what resources are available. Al Avner

---------- response 3
  02/16/76     09.57     frye       mfl

Does the 550 terminal amount reflect a system in which a
large majority of the terminals are in "classroom-type"
situations -- where daytime usage of the 1008 input ports
could well exceed 550? Or is it based only on our exper-
ience with this system where author interaction is more
important (and accordingly, since authors can work at less
"standard" times, maximum usage is less)?

---------- response 4
  02/16/76     10.12     golden       s
Historically, the problem originates from the difference
between the original design of PLATO IV and its actual
implmentation. Originally we expected to have about 30
classrooms of about 32 terminals each. In each classroom,
fewer than 10 lessons would be used.

Now if we meet those assumptions all 940 of our terminals
could be used by students simultaneously; but we all know
that that isn't the way we choose to use PLATO.

We have ECS for about 400 users. We have CPU for 500 to
600. We shall soon have double the computational power, and
we are doing all we can to find a way to add more memory.
You may be sure that future PLATO system designs will take
advantage of our present knowledge of how users implement
PLATO. You can also be sure that when extra resources are
available, users will consume them and there will still be
a shortage.

---------- response 5
  02/16/76     10.32     avner       s

All data are based on current experience (the main reason
PLATO is run in as "open" a manner as possible is to gather
realistic information on use of such a resource). Clearly
it would be possible to place limits on ECS and CPU use
per terminal to insure that 1000 terminals could run--but
that would lead us to the sort of sort of self-fulfilling prophecies
on design that we have berated other people for.

does any one know if avner's observation that there is
an infinestimally low probability of over 550 users at
once is due to a freely chosen pattern of use or rather
to the fact that when there are over 500, the system
becomes increasingly unpleasant until people just get
bugged enough and drop off!?
*
also: if the ECS supports 400 users at the level to which
they have become accustomed, and the CPU supports 600 or
more, why on earth double the CPU? it would seem that
the ECS (or whatever other memory) development should
have far and away the highest priority. or is there
more to this cpu business than meets the eye?

---------- response 7

There is indeed more to the CPU business than meets the eye.
We need to develop ways to add computational power as needed
so as to build much larger PLATO systems. And, there are
other services, (e.g. background data processing), which we
wish to offer but cannot.

Similarly, we are seeking ways to add memory as needed.

As long as the larger sites are trading terminals for
ECS during peak loads, it is clear that there is some 
limitation of terminal usage due to restriction of resources
but this is one of those chicken-and-egg deals. There are
not enough resources to support every terminal as an
independent learning resource center. Given this fact,
the options are to restrict ECS and CPU to permit all
terminals to operate in a restricted mode, to restrict
number of terminals to permit a limited number of terminals
unrestricted operation, or a compromise that attempts to
permit relatively unrestricted operation until resources run
out. The latter approach is being used in order to provide
both service to current users and data for future designs.

One thing missed in the discussion is that with 1000
terminals installed, even with 10 times as much ECS
there would NEVER be full occupancy. As with the telephone
system, one CAN count on some terminals not being in

turn away users above 500 terminals, but perhaps the

It is well known from
experience with utilities that pricing policies which do
not take into account different levels of use at different
times result in off-time users heavily subsidizing peak-
time users, and an apparently ever-increasing demand for
peak capacity. Pricing policies which do take into account
different levels of use at different times, on the other
hand, result in much more efficient use of capacity, a
lower cost/price per unit of consumption, and less intense
effective demand for increased capacity. Since PLATO has
beautiful built-in capabilities for time-dependent account-
ing, it would be altogether reasonable for those who are
looking to the commercial future of PLATO to be thinking
along such lines. In any case, experience formed in a flat-
(or, no-) rate situation is not really predictive of what
will happen if more sophistocated policies are in effect.

Surely we have a beautiful example of "pricing" already
in effect!

The "price" of ECS (and CPU) is "high" during the day,
which encourages people to work during off hours when
the "price" of ECS for lessons and CPU for big background
job is much lower.

---------- response 15
  02/16/76     17.43     gilpin       peer 

Well, yes and no, Judy. On PLATO as in some other contexts,
"rush hour" is unpleasant enough that people will avoid it
if they easily can...but if the cost of extra capacity is
not translated into monetary terms in a direct way (eg, it
costs $10 to cross the bridge at 5:10 pm), there develops a
larger demand to make "rush hour" less unpleasant by adding
capacity (ie, another bridge).
Of course, any added capacity is quickly sopped up
and the original situation, with the original responses, is
re-instated, just as we observe on PLATO. But the added ca-
pacity is needed only at the peaks, and charging the costs
of extra capacity only to the peak users has the effect of
helping people to realize that maybe they can get along
quite well using the resource at other than peak times.
This not only spreads out the use but reduces the DEMAND
for more capacity.

gilpin's point is well-taken and should NOT be interpreted

charged on a monthly or annual basis but the magnitude

My earlier comments may have led to some misconceptions
evident in recent comments.
1)Current peak loads are based solely on experience with
the distribution of users on the current system. There is
no justification for extrapolation to other kinds of uses.
In particular. since the U of I PLATO classrooms almost
universally are saturated with users during a large part 
of the prime hours, there is good reason to believe that
a system consisting solely of terminals which were either
accessable to many people or used for service functions
(PSO and system-type things) would frequently saturate.
2)Data being gathered under the current conditions are NOT
intended to predict future peak loads but to determine
the extent to which unexpected, new, effective applications
arise from free access to various CBE resources. If new
approaches result (as they have in the past), there may be

---------- response 18
  02/17/76     08.51     avner       s

justification for modification of future systems. If no
such new approaches are developed, there may be
justification for investigating cost-effective methods
for spreading use of more limited resources. If we
prematurely limit access to resources then we guarantee that
new techniques which require a different mix of resources
are less likely to be explored.
3) Parallels to use of public utilities are of value but
should be used with caution. First, PLATO has more of a
research interest than such utilities have (or can afford).
Second, occupancy and usage factors are more complex with
PLATO (or other multiple application systems) than with
voice telephone systems or with bridges. Bell Telephone
is now discovering this fact of life as a result of trying
to relate current PLATO communication load factors to their
established usage prediction techniques.

it would take there to hold the amount of data you need.
One problem I foresee is how does one get this amount of

I assume that some local preprocessing of the EEG is being

do the recording locally as well and add the data from
PLATO to your EEG data rather than the other way around.
Your DEC equipment should make this an easy task and the

If the name for the -arrow- command is changed, we probably
will still be calling that thing on the screen an "arrow."
(It needs some name; I'd prefer to tell students about
Plato's arrow rather than Plato's input marker.)

So whether the -arrow- command is renamed or not,
-inhibit arrow- can remain as is.

The -vector- command could be renamed -pointer- without any
confusion, but renaming it -arrow- would mean that this
symbol ¬6 would need another name.

With Clark and Broadus: Is this trip necessary? What
exactly is the perceived difficulty with 'vector'?

If 'arrow' is going to be changed, I suggest 'marker' as
the replacement, since the command serves as a marker in
the TUTOR code as well as putting a place marker on the
screen. It used to be the case that the structure of a
unit was described using this language, altho I'm not
sure this is still so.

Whatever term is chosen, let it NOT be one that continues
the habit of viewing interaction as (only) scholastic
question-and-answering. An -arrow- simply lets the person
at the terminal say something to the program he is using,
and "judging" is basically interpretation and only trivially
a scoring procedure. Our language should reflect these
facts and not further promote the view that PLATO is only
a"teaching machine".

   Maybe i'm just weird, but I think that the arrow
command should not relate to a screen location:

   Something that could be looked into for further
development of the tutor judging state would be to remove
the tag from -arrow-. (and maybe rename it) This, we
would have:

at 1010
arrow

   This would have the advantage of defining more
precisely the indication of where/what judging is, and
would replace all those blasted arrow where+1 things
that we are now stuck with.
   There would be no problems with conversion, except
to created some ambiguity in those cases where "where",
"wherex", and "wherey" are used.
   The new structure would also be more consistent
with changes, both planned and made, to the graphics portion

I will only note that those of you who like the name
"vector" and think it the only appropriate name for
a line with an arrowhead on it are displaying your
biases as people with a strong physical science background.
The word not only means nothing to most people, it
sounds very exotic and somewhat threatening. Step as
"far" away from physical science as biology, and you will
find the word "vector" has quite a different meaning
(albeit with a similar derivation).
 
It may be that we cannot change the name of the present
arrow command, but it would help ordinary mortals if
-vector- became -pointer-, or some such. When someone
wants to draw attention to something on the screen by
drawing a line with an arrowhead pointing at it, it should
not be necessary to think in terms of an entity whose

As Loitz points out, anyone who has taken high school

As far as -arrow- goes, I would like to enter a plea

     I think -vector- is a very descriptive name, since it
can only be used with respect to an origin. It would be nice
however to have an -arrow- or -pointer- that accepted fine
or gross grid coordinates and wasn't affected by the origin.

     The present -arrow- is really a misnamed command. It
causes Plato to wait for a -response- (a little too long) or
-reply-. This may be confused with the misnamed -answer-
command which is actually looking for a -right- (sounds like
-write- unfortunately) or -correct- response. -Arrow- and
-answer- have been around for a long time but there's no
time like the present for changing them to something more
descriptive.

   I don't see how -vector- could be replaced by
-arrow-. In physics, a vector (which happens to be
represented by a symbol that is called an arrow -¬=-=> )
indicates a direction, while on Plato, a similar symbol
(also called an arrow ¬6 ) usually indicates that some
type of response is awaited. Seems to me that changing
the command name would benefit few if any people.

The input symbol we use now is called an arrow, and will
be called an arrow until the day that it no longer looks
like an arrow. When authors program, they ask questions
at an arrow, and when students work, they make responses
because the arrow asks them to. I believe that changing
the "input maker" command name to something similiar to
-input- could turn out to be more disruptive than beneficial
except to physical science oriented people who call
vectors 'arrows'.

Lesson microtable is the equivalent for microtables to
lesson linesets and charsets. It contains a number of
microtables (but not the standard microtable).
One easy way to get the standard microtable is to ask for
a non-existent microtable.

As Todd says, two "space" characters are used to make
transmission of the characters to the terminal more
efficient.

To see how it works, put designs (characters) into 0
and 64. Then type (FONT) ab cd ef AB CD EF.
You will see the 1st (0) picture inbetween the lower
case letters, and the 2nd (64) picture between the

---------- note 465 old tutor
  02/17/76     19.30     blomme       s

   During an institute in the summer of 1967, Paul Tenczar
induced a couple of the participants to try his new
language. The following is a sample of code at that time:

NAME P1182
PLOT TYPE YOUR aNSWER. tHEN
      HIT jUDGE.

      PROBLEM. IF THE LOGARITHM OF X TO THE
            BASE 10 is 2, WHAT IS THE
            VALUE OF X ?
ARROW  1010
JUDGE  3
ANS    100
 
   The name and plot commands very soon became unit and
write. The positioning command on PLATO III (not evident
in any examples I could find) was called where. This
became at and the ans became answer on PLATO IV. Only
the arrow command has survived--so far!

---------- response 1
  02/17/76     19.36     blomme       s

   Note that everything in the example appeared in
caps. This was characteristic of all early work on
PLATO III; the famous uplow command was eventually
instituted to permit both upper and lower case characters
to be written. Other commands whose names were changed
in the early going were cjump (for calc jump) and
ujump (for unit jump)--they are now the goto and jump.
   If anyone wonders what that strange judge 3 command
is in the preceding example, I can only speculate that
it provided a means to call up something other than case,
standard character string matching judger--in this case,
presumably judger number 3 was some sort of numeric judger.
Perhaps only Paul Tenczar can give a definitive answer
to that one!

  02/18/76     04.25     blomme       s

   A possible change that has been thought about is
to fix the size to apply to the arrow--i.e., if you
have placed a size 2 before an arrow in order to get
the student's input in size 2, then the arrow itself
would be plotted in size 2. Of course, rotate would
also apply, so that an arrow would be plotted pointing
the proper direction. This would seem to present some
problems, however, since the plotting of a larger arrow
and the appropriate sized space after it before the
start of key input plotting would cause the plotting
to start at a different location than it does currently.
   Comments are welcome, but it would be most useful
to have those of users who are actually using this
feature currently.

---------- response 1

The tag on the arrow should apply to the lower left corner
of the ARROW and not where the first writing is displayed.
In the case in which the arrow is inhibited, the lower left
of the first character position will be the position of
that of the tag.

I don't want to ruffle any feathers, but I would like to
express dissatisfaction with the number of new group notes-
files that have elected to invoke total restriction powers
on all but a few users. I am not talking about notesfiles
used primarily for student comments or semi-personal com-
munication, but the large number of files owned by curric-
ulum development and site groups for inter-author communica-
tion.

It is certainly the prerogative of the owners of the file
to limit access to it as they see fit. But GNOTES is such
a great tool for promoting inter-group communication that
it seems a shame to me that so many groups have chosen to
shut out other authors completely.

I think what may be the problem more then that they
have elected to invoke their total power is that
they have failed to invoke their total power and haven't
bothered to set Other type classifications to something

directors to go back and take the few minutes to
set up the other options.

One of the problems in allowing unrestricted access to
discussions in curriculum group notes files is that often
such discussions explicitly mention information that
should not be made public, such as names of lessons in
developmental stages, and preliminary data on lesson use
and performance. For this reason, the chemistry group
restricts access to people involved in work genuinely
related to chemistry curriculum development and use.

I discovered today when working through a lesson in
student mode, that the micro-i (¬D + 7 spaces) is a
BIG pain" I needed to make many degree signs (¬o=micro-o),
and frequently missed and got micro-i instead.

A typing error normally wouldn't bother a student at all;
a quick touch on the ERASE button and all is well.
However, in the case of micro-i, the student must
erase _seven_ spaces before he gets back far enough to
erase the ¬D . Unless the student is in the habit of
banging away on the erase key, he may never discover this.

I think the convenience of the student is more important
than the convenience of authors. The micro-i should
be changed somehow. Maybe it could just be ¬D TAB ?

i discovered that phenomenon accidentally while in course
records some weeks ago...reported it to pso...got the ex-
planation that it was probably peculiar to course records
which were being "worked on" at the time...incidentally,
entering a student named micro i (¬D ) into course
records will be followed by a message "student d added"...
attempt to delete student micro i(¬D ) gets message
"no such student: and one must delete student "d"...however,
at    1010
write ¬D $$micro i
at    1010
write ¬0m,e¬1d
does not erase the ¬D
only
write ¬0m,e¬1¬D $$micro i
will make the erasure

It is very handy....I think they just use a bump
to get rid of ugly things like sups, subs, shifts, etc.

When backspacing causes one to move back beyond the arrow
margin, (i.e., the student types 'abc' BKSP BKSP BKSP BKSP
'___'), the ERASE key erases things from the wrong place.
Thus, pressing ERASE after the above example erases an
underline beneath the 'c', where there is none. The
underline is gone when one does a -storea-, but it is
still on the screen, and this makes things messy.

The recent change allow site directors to make permanent
reservations was a step forward. Could I suggest another
step along the same lines. That is to make the guaranteed
minimum ecs for each site very with the hour of the day
during prime time. (By now the system should have enough
experience to make such a guarantee and give considerably
more guaranteed ecs during the hours of 8-10 a.m. and
6-10 p.m. than is available now.) The site director could
then permanently reserve a larger number of lessons for
those hours.

This change would encourage use of facilities now
underutilized (and be a little self-defeating in that
regard). It would be consistent with the philosophy
of operating in the statistically safe range expressed
in the system replies to the recent note on system
resources (1000 terminals, etc.).

Suppose you reserve 40K worth of lessons when your

The reservation list would be broken down into high-prime

guranteed for each part of prime time being what the system

PLATO is like an airline that flies a 747 in the morning

I think you missed Ruth's point, Peter. If you reserve
40K of lessons at 8:00 am when your allotment is high,
who is going to delete 10K of those lessons at 10:00 am
when your allotment drops to 30K?

The student is allowed to request up to 40K at 8:00 am
on the theory that by 10:00 am, when the allotment goes
down, he (or somebody else) will be finished and the
site's load will drop. Now, in theory, you could subscribe
to 40K at 8:00 am and keep that 40K all day long by
having students work continuously. In practice, the
site loads drop quite quickly to the 10:00 am maximum.

You have a point, Judy, that there would have to be a
pretty tough deletion mechanism at 10:00 a.m., though I
might be willing to live with that drawback.

Some of our lessons are in the form of timed exercises
that take half an hour. If we programmed the lesson
or router to let no one into such a lesson after 9:00
we would have no problems at 10:00.

However there would be no deletion problem in the evening,
since the available ecs gets greater and greater as
time goes on.

My guess is that the exponential routine is performed in
floating point (to be completely general?). The machine
has no 60-bit integer multiply -- it multiplies 48-bit
" integers" that are actually floating point quantities with
a zero exponent.

This is a known old age problem. It comes with the fact
that functions are not optimised. So what? 2ˆ2 is a function
call (well close enough). It does some strange things
allowing for floating point numbers in the exponent. I am
all for correcting these problems, but it turns out that
in some cases condensed code for lessons can be expanded.
(supposed you did 2ˆ2+v1. It then would have to convert 4
into a floating number, which is more operations than
is presently necessary.) Although, if one looks at it
another way, the average user would be blest with luck.
One person is working on this area right now, I'm hoping
he has enough interest to correct many of these problems.

The designers of Tutor have been careful in differentiating
the internal representation of a number of expression (which
is dependent on whatever machine Tutor is running on) from 
its value.

This allows them to store an expression in whatever
representation is easiestˆ*, because it is only the
value that is important, not the representation.
Also, the representation may change at ANY time in
the future, as long as the value remains the same.
(I expect some representations will change this week!)

However, for those who really want to work with internal
representations, they have provided functions for that
purpose too... functions such as $cls$ $ars$ $mask$
$diff$ and "bitcnt". These functions may ignore the value
of their operands, and look only at their representation.

As the writer of the original note has probably found
out, "2ˆ2" is an expression whose value is 4, but whose
representation currently happens to be in floating
form. while the representation of "4" is integer.

No, bitcnt on floating point representations is not
a useless operation, you just can't find a use for it.
I could say that -readd- is a useless command, just
because I, at the time, don't have any need for it.
(ie, bitcnt should not convert the argument to integer)

The representation of "2ˆ2" is floating point since it
easiestˆ* for some part of the system to have it that way.

PLEASE don't change -bitcnt-! Checking for floating point.
rounding, and converting would waste an awful lot of time.
-bitcnt- is very useful now because it is so fast.

I haven't much sympathy with the poor confused people
who don't understand why -bitcnt- gives funny answers.
Anybody who uses -bitcnt- should be sufficiently
sophisticated to use -showo-, upon which the answer
would become immediately apparent.

A great deal of thought and effort has been invested in
making -write- and -calc- as foolproof (innocent-proof?)
as possible, but nobody has ever suggested that bit
operations could be used without thinking.

Suggestion:

Implement a function called "actual" whose effect
would be to return the actual bit pattern of the
argument. Thus, "actual(2)" would return 02, whereas
"actual(2.0)" would return whatever floating-point garp
is lying around. (Thus, actual would make no attempt to
do conversions.) You could then do -bitcnt- on the
result YOU want -bitcnt-ed.

Much time in "site" is spent sending the same tired old
messages to students about ECS being almost full or
a shortage of terminals for scheduled students. In almost
every case, the messages used are the same, because
students are more comfortable if they recognize the
message, and because we usually are saying the same
thing anyway.
Would it be at all possible to allow site directors 
to specify a small number of standard messages which
can be recalled at the message arrow?

---------- response 1

A small "permanent but editable" message buffer would be a
boon! Perhaps a dataset could be devoted at the systems
level to serving as the message buffer for all the different
sites. Each site would automatically and unalterably have
access to a specific and unique block (or blocks) for its
own messages!

It shouldn't be necessary to add more than 30-40 words of
storage to "site" in order to fill this need, plus a simple
datain/dataout routine and a short message editor!!

It would avoid what has happened already: in adding a
course in order to give high access status to one individual
in the course, Other for the course is automatically set
to "no access", even though Other for course Other is set
to some higher access status. Thus, without realizing it,
the director may have shut out all other users in that one

Well, there is ONE very good reason - the current
system accent is hard wired into your terminal.

If the system were to change it, it would require
that each terminal (of 950) receives a new hard
wired character memory.
If it is any consolation, the language laboratory
has been using the same accent that you suggest
for several years.

I hope you managed to find your way through the

your ¬e will automatically backspace and rise for capital
letters.

Yes, that IS some consolation. Literally 'wired in', eh?

A few problems i'd like to comment on...

We still are not receiving an entirely intelligible
message on 'crashes' but they seem to be improving.

Also, we've noticed that in the editor many times
we'll make a key-press and Plato will ignore it.

Is this a system-wide problem or are we the only

     The second problem you describe is too vague to
merit an exact answer. Tutor lessons execute under time
constraints, and since the editor is indeed a tutor lesson,
it is not exempt from these checks. Perhaps you are asking
the editor to do too much too fast. Please re-respond and
be more specific.

ok

join    concept3('group 3')

The -judge again- would retain the -specs- , -bump-s, and
-put-s, like -judge continue-, but would reset *anscnt*
to zero. Thus it would be possible to maintain independent
concept lists to which entries could be added without throw-

effect can be gotten by juggling a parallel counter with the
value of *anscnt*, decrementing after the -join-: messy.

It sure might be nice if..................dept't.

Would it be feasible to have a command -*unit____tag-
which would give the effect of having a dummy unit "tag"
in the lesson. This would be useful when you're editing
a lesson and want to remove some time consuming displays
and/or animations. The *unit command would keep track
of the unit name so the 'unit XXX not found' messages
would stay in their caves, but would not execute the unit
itself.
This article would be most useful in cases where the units
to be *ed are interspersed with other needed units and are
so many that the cstop-cstart combinations would be a pain.

Presumably these "dummy units" are do-ed or join-ed; why
not just insert a "goto    q" right after the unit command
(you could mark it with a comment so you could easily
find it when your testing is done)?

        That would be _very_ dangerous, unless you were
extremely careful about which units were *ed out. So star-
ing out working units should probably be avoided. I have
suggested that you be able to specify at condense time
whether you want to see errors and/or warnings. The initial
response to this suggestion was favorable, but apparently
no work has been done on it as yet. Someday, maybe....

*-ing out working units (or portions thereof) can be
dangerous, TRUE! However, I find that "signing" my
*-ed lines workes quite well:

*do     bigone    $$,jns

When I want to put everything back together, I just do a
search for "jns" to find all those lines.

    Does anyone know of any limits on the length argument
of the -showa- command? When I do a -showa- with a
length greater than 2772 characters, the number of
characters actually shown isn't predictable. I have
tried using several consecutive embedded -showa-s but
the results are no better. I would appreciate any
advice as to any other way that 4224 chars could be
displayed at one.

Well, for one thing, the number of character spaces is
usually a lot smaller than the number of 6-bit character
codes, as anyone who has tried to write a line of caps
in lesson "pad" knows.
I found when I had this problem that putting a -catchup-

It seems as if the true/false judger assumes if x¬=0 (false)

not a bit or (a$jnion$b). (0$or$1) ¬=0 therefore it's =-1.

   Most safely you should simply assume that the result of

undefined--our logic here is still of the primitive
two valued kind!

To rephrase Rick's comment, for $or$ and $and$,
your expression should always have the form:
(truth equation)$or$(truth equation)

(x=4) $or$ (y¬>17)

At one time I knew the where-abouts of code generators for:
        Music(Staves and Notes)

Interesting question!

References:
music   peters/music
chem    wegner/phar (fancy generator)
        stan smith/chem (a different, simpler approach)

I don't know about the schematics.

Another interesting code generator is "csdesigns" by
Axel Schreiner. I have not made use of the "code generator"
portion of the lesson. The design part of the lesson is
extremely handy when you want to "talk" to someone about
lesson structure, because you can make flow charts very
quickly.... complete with NEXTs, BACKs, LABs, imain units,
and multiple branching. It is much faster than drawing
a flowchart using SD.

During drop in periods (at least at City Colleges of
 Chicago) only fortunate few early students can get
lessons. Others get "memory allocation exceeded" which
drives them to despair, confusion, etc.
I noticed that some games lessons as in "sports"
tell the would -be signer on that ecs is high and that
s/he cannot pick freely from the list but may pick
the same lesson someone else is using.

Suggestion:
If we do this for games why can't we show/tell the
student what the lucky few are using so s/he can
 access same non-game lesson someone else is using?
Rationale: A circumscribed choice is better than no
 choice at all.

What is necessary is your authors of "game" type lessons to
use daycheck screening processes on the users. This is
the practice I've seen several people use which
effectively inhibits purely recreational lessons from
general use at hours of high ECS crunch. Usually this is
between 8 and 5. If this were done by authors or such
lessons, the problem wold virtually disappear.

Jim, let's put your suggestion in the proper perspective.
It is up to the individual site director to decide how
his site is used - if the director of a site allows trek,
that is his prerogative.

Since site 0 is unique, it may be that special checks
should be made for "network", but to call for blanket
time check on all recreational lessons is unreasonable.

not exactly, sir berger of mfldom... if you check the

in which "systems" admit that the excessive use of
computer resources by some users affects all others
users. somewhere back, there is a note in "mednotes"
by golden is which he says and i quote more or less
loosely: "it is unconscionable for people to play
games in prime time... when ecs is tight..."
*
the correct solution is for the system to flag lessons
which are essentially recreational in nature-- not
game type simulations used in teaching-- and remove these
automatically from ecs when ecs available is less than
a specified portion of the available total-- say 75:.
*
another possibility, though a tedious one, is the
publication is these notes of the names and courses
which abuse ecs in prime time.

It strikes me as being even MORE tedious to sit here and
bring up this whole can of worms about games/nongames
once more! Go ahead and publish those names and courses
-- perhaps someone might consider a "gripe"notes file for
general-purpose nagging and other worthwhile activities.
If enough people get embarassed by public criticism THEN
you could get results.

The best solution in my mind is to finally come up with
a site-dependent lesson _i__n__h__i__b__i__T_ function similar to the
"reserved lesson" option. Is that really so difficult?

numerical approximations. If you just want specific
values for these distributions, see lesson "star" (select
the probability distribution option). Actually, a table
is a device which is required for another medium (the book).
Usually all you really want are a selected set of values.
Lesson "stat" provides more values with higher accuracy

        By making the sign bit the _only_ bit stored, and
setting the lsb to 0, you can store the proper values.
In this scheme an n-bit signed segment is converted to an
then $cls$ing it 59-n places to the lsb of the integer,
the $ars$ing the integer 59-n bits.
What I am suggesting is that for 1-bit signed segments
this process be used exactly as is. Then in conversion.
o0$cls$59$ars$58=o00000000000000000000=0 or
02$cls$59$ars$58=o77777777777777777776=-1
At present, a 1-bit signed segment is stored the same as
a 1-bit regular segment. To pull regular segments out
they are simply put in the lsb's of the destination
integer.

There are several ways to check for -0 with a signed segment
define segment,seg=n1,1,signed
a)     bitcnt(seg(1))
b)     seg(1)$mask$_1_

If signed segments were changed as suggested, case a and b
could be affected.
One other point in favor of not changing is "consistancy".

All in all, one bit signed segments seem rather useless.

Thanks Dave, but I see computer-based discussion more as

of a blabber-mouth in person.

I think if PLATO bases its existence too strongly on
traditional instructional lessons, as opposed to computer
conferencing applications, then it will only have a
transient importance in the field. Within five years it
should be possible to build stand-alone plato terminals
that will do everything the current architecture does
without the high communication charges for isolated
terminals. Lessons will be stored on video disks and
executed in microprocessors connected to 64k RAM's.
If these technologies come through, and there is every
reason to expect they will, the PLATO gospel claiming
longer hold any water. The current emphasis puts all our
eggs in one basket in my view.

  Re note ¬$24 (anscnt?0):
Rather than have a special command to set *anscnt* (and a
special command to set *lscore*, and a...), why not cut
down on the plethora of commands (¬+ add several handy
features!) by combining it all into one command? I'm
proposing a -reset- command (or something) which would
effectively be a -calc- on systems defined vars. This
would obviously have to be restricted somewhat (I can see
it now: "reset mallot?2ˆ6ˆ0-1"), but think how handy it
would be with vars like

ntries (!)       key(!!!)     anscnt     jcount (marginal)
wcount          nhelpop        fromnum     lscore

     Why not just let authors redefine any sys variable
they want to. It is their problem, not the system's, if
they louse up one of their routines that depends on one of
the redefined variables

---------- response 4
  02/21/76     18.39     berger       mfl

That isn't true at all - the system guarantees the integrity
of those variables. If you could modify them, the system
might just as well withdraw them altogether.

this -calc- line is giving me an -index- execution

val1=1
val2=0

this seems simple but val(13) is within range!...In fact
the execution error may be prevented by commenting off
the end of the line (-val1+val2) and may be caused
by replacing the end with (-1)!?!!/!!/!?

defined array but the error happens when it is defined
as     [ val(a)=n(43+a) ] also.

One thing I saw about the new 'U' option. While
going through it, I saw a blank line for site-station
9-28 (just showing the number, but no name). Was this
an error, or just catching someone signing off? I think
this didn't happen in the old version, and should not
happen here. I saw it for about 20 seconds, or 3-4
replots.
Just thought someone should know.

     Why, in the following code, does the code in the
-doto- get done? To my way of thinking (and obviously
not PLATOs), the branch should skip around the -doto-.

unit   test
branch 1end
doto   1end,n1?1,10
at     202+(100?n1)
write  In the loop.
1end
end    lesson

  However, this isn't the case. The above code produces
a nice group of 'In the loop's'.

---------- response 1
  02/22/76     15.51     jim g       reading

If you read aids on branching and doto all will become
clear to you. What you are doing is a bad programming
practice and unpredictable. What you are doing is branching
into the doto loop because the end label of the doto loop
does more than act as a normal branching label.

P.S. In aids ask for info on "branch" (DATA key), choose
choice "e" and what you need is on the 5th page of writeup.

---------- response 2
  02/22/76     17.26     friedman       csa

In other words, the end label of a doto loop is WITHIN
the loop. So by branching to it, you are getting into
the loop.

---------- response 3

If you change your last '1end' to '2end' and change your

---------- response 4
  02/23/76     09.08     koning       csstaff

No, because then there is no label for the -doto- to refer
to. Adding '2end' would be correct.

One other thing. I noticed several students listed

674/iudemo was listed, but not student/pfw. Is the

both the 'E' page and the 'U' page? It seems like it.

       How are defined variables treated when one
       lesson -uses- another? In particular, is
       it necessary to redefine all variables in
       an ieu for the -used- lesson, providing
       they have the same names as those in the
       -user- lesson?

       I have several lessons that all -use- a
       single lesson which contains various
       subroutines, etc. I am wondering whether
       it is really necessary to have -defines- in
       the -used- lesson, since it is never run
       by itself.

---------- response 1
  02/22/76     17.29     friedman       csa
When one lesson -use-s part of another, everything acts
just as if the code in the -use-d block were inserted
into the -use-ing lesson in place of the -use- command.
So any -define-s in effect before the -use- are still
in effect during and after it, unless there are -define-
commands in the -use-d block which change this.

I have several lessons which all-use- a block of defines
from one lesson. As Mr. Friedman mentions, it isn't
necessary to insert defines in all your lessons as long
as the defines aren't being overridden in your other
lessons.

---------- response 4
  02/24/76     09.19     shirer       vu

   The other way around is just as convenient. In one
series of related lessons, all the defines are in a
common lesson -used- by all the others.

One more feature (or extension) I would like to see is
for -getword- (or something similar) to return EVERY

a,b, and c." would return the words (the,options,are,a,b,

the overwrite error is known...

and final testing is being done on the option that will
let you completely define all your characters as far as
"judging behavior"...one option allows you to define
a "puncword" which is to be considered a punctuation and
a word...hence, you can finally put punctuations in
answer-type commands and obtain the "puncword" via
the new getword command

why, you can even define the letter "o" to be equivalent
to "0"...and then "10?10" will yield "100"

Unfortunate, but it seems that the only thing that the
system can be sure that you do not want your monitor to
see is whatever is done after you leave the system.
Otherwise, you would be restricting the use of one of the
function keys to non-monitor mode, which would defeat it's

---------- note 201 -return?-
  02/23/76     14.39     warner       iu

The -return- command is a source of confusion to
new TUTOR authors. It "returns" control from the user's
lesson to the PLATO monitor, thus forcing an end to the
timeslice. Its most useful use is in waiting for common:
1wait  branch comuse(him),x,1ready
branch $$ allows others to process
branch 1wait
1ready $$ go on with stuff
       The problem is that new PLATO users almost always
use some other command there, i.e. -pause- (does the work
but slow) or -delay- (fills up TUTOR output buffer but does
not halt processing). The -return- command they almost
always confuse with -goto q- or -exit-.
       A suggestion: change the name of this command to
-wait-. It more nearly conveys the use to which the command
is put.

---------- response 1
  02/23/76     14.59     bowery       comm

Perhaps a -pause- with a tag of 0 could work in this
capacity (no -timeup- involved).

---------- response 2
  02/23/76     21.06     david       cerlcc

Using -pause 0- for this clearly independent function
only further obscures tutor code. -return- should probably
be renamed though. How about -endslice- , with no tag.

Is there expected to be any decreases or increases in the
cost of CERL PLATO service over the 1976-77 fiscal year
for remote sites? Please comment on all major charges:
1) CPU/IO/DISK, 2) Repair and parts replacement, 3) other.
Especially interested to hear whether the increase to
1000 terminals will drop total charges for 1 above, or
whether the new accounting scheme will affect different
users differently. Also interested on what the policy will
be for replacement of burned-in (or out) panels.

  02/23/76     15.29     bowery       comm

  The ideas about what to do with the new -packc- are
real neet. Here is a suggestion which I stated previously
and would like to have criticized by anyone who gets
the urge (preferably the people working on -packc-):

  Instead of the -pack- and -packc- commands with the embed
stuff, simply allow a person to divert the output of the
internal code generating commands (-write-, -showa-, embeds
etc...) to variables.
Something like:

outvar on,n1,100 $$100 chars available from n1
writec var¬,bloop¬,¬0a,stuff,21¬1 ¬0e,exp¬1
showo  octal
outvar off,n11 $$put char count in n11

It seems that this would be a somewhat more elegant way
of doing things. Any reasons why if would be unwieldy?

There have been arguments pro and con over both methods.
Probably your scheme will not be implemented, since it
has altogether too many repercussions. For example,
what should be done with the output generated by
-draw- and -circle- statements?

---------- response 3
  02/24/76     15.56     bowery       comm

Ooops, I didn't mean "internal code" in the system
programming sense. I meant it in the "character code"
sense (ala AIDS).

Output from line, char, ext, audio, etc... commands
should simply be sent as usual.
This would make programs that format and send printer
output much simpler and easier to read.
There are many applications like this

Of course this DOES present a minor problem with -plot-
and -codeout- but it would seem that these commands
could generate the "internal code" and zap it into the
variables with the -outvar- flag on. Such a conversion
would be very useful.

---------- response 4

Every other system I've ever seen has either had, or has
been working hard on obtaining, a fairly complete and
general format for I/O redirection. One of the most general
I've ever seen (that of UNIX) allows any process to send
output to, or get input from, any file or process as well
as the terminal.
Example:
(date; ls)¬Ipr -4
would output the date and a list of all one's files to
another program that would print the stuff in 4-column
format on the terminal. Adding "¬Iopr" to the chain would
send the 4-column output to the line printer via a spooler.
I speak from experience when I say that this degree of
flexibility adds an unimaginable degree of power to a
system!

It would be nice if in the common editor you would see
the hidden characters. I am going blind trying to count
over in the octal the correct numbers of spaces to read
the correct octal. Something like the H option would be
nice.

---------- response 1
  02/23/76     17.26     straayer       telcomc

     Would converting the common to source, then using the
"hidden character" option help? You can then convert the
source back to common, after the "hidden" check.

---------- response 2
  02/23/76     18.13     clark       lawyer

That is quite messy. The format of the editor now is that
whenever there is a hidden char in the variable, a space
is printed in that spot of the alpha representation. Why
not put in a symbol to show what that char is????

What you suggest is impossible, because unit uiop could
be attached from several different main units, and the
statement label would presumably have to appear in all
those main units.

What you want can be acheived with -goto q- or -exit-.

In the example you've given, no explicit statment to return
to the main unit is needed; such return is automatic.

---------- response 2
  02/23/76     17.05     clark       lawyer

But then he would not skip all of the code between the
do and the statement label. I usually but a marker in
the unit -do-ne and then put a branching command after
the do to skip the code if the unit has been done. It
is also possible to change the statement label to an
entry command and -goto- if from the -do-ne unit.

---------- response 3
  02/24/76     09.43     friedman       csa

Cole, what you want, even if possible, would result in
code which would be a nightmare for anyone else to ever
read or debug. And the chances of it working properly
are small. You really should appreciate the fact that,
if you're writing a program or lesson for some group,
the time WILL (not may) come when that program is going
to have to be changed. Weird little obscure coding tricks
make working on someone else's program a nightmare.
Stick to writing programs that humans can read, as well
as computers, and save the sanity of those who come after
you!

I had some problems when I changed the names of some lessons
today that were linked by jumpouts and use commands.

The first thing I did was to go through and change all
the linking jumpouts and uses. Then I changed the names
of the lessons from newbosnia, siu0, roper, and guanogap
(where newbosnia was the -used- lesson) to guanogap,
guanogap1, guanogap2, and guanogap3 respectively.

Then I went to test the jumpouts. I found that while
the jumpouts to guanogap1, 2, and 3 worked properly,
attempts to jump to guanogap produced, in order, missing
unit story in lesson guanogap, No Such Lesson, missing
unit story in lesson guanogap, and No Such Lesson.

In desperation, I recondensed guanogap, bouncing the
three authors who were in there at the time. (My
apologies to them.) Then all went well.

Anybody had anything like this happen to them?

---------- response 1
  02/23/76     16.53     woolley       p

Changing the names to guanogap1,2, and 3 allowed you
to recondense those lessons without the old copies of
the lessons (under the old names) necessarily being
deleted from ECS. However, when you changed the name of
one lesson to a name that had been in use previously
(guanogap), jumping cut to that lesson took you to the
old copy in ECS, which was actually the lesson that had
previously had that name. It therefore didn't have the
units you expected to be in guanogap.

I don't know why you would get "no such lesson"...

On typing "35823582" at the arrow I got an index error on

Al, you'll find that almost EVERY compiler that handles
simple logical statements like the one you mention will
evaluate the entire expression, then do or not do the
branch. This is uslally because it is far easier to
break the expression up into simple comparisons, then
OR or AND or <whatever> them together, THEN branch on
that result. Generally the only exception (usually) is
on one-accumulator machines, where it is more difficult
to store intermediate results.

the problem once last semester shortly after a message

specifically to nate/iua202,  but in general to everybody:

We (pso) keep getting questions and comments about
the tags of conditional commands, and we do try to clarify
the AIDS explanations ...... but:

¬D ¬D  ALL  ¬A ¬A conditional commands have the form

command (expression),what to do for -1,what to do for 0,
what to do for 1, etc.

The commands -match- and -keytype- are not really
conditional commands because there is NO expression eval-
uated to decide "what to do". Instead, something in the
extended tag is evaluated (the word or the key value)

in order to decide what to put INTO the variable. The
is just the reverse of the way a conditional command works.
"-1" has to be reserved for the "not found" case.

   I have an arrow preceded by a -size- command and the
student's response appears in sized writing as I desire.
There is also a -specs-nookno- in effect, and the markup
does NOT appear as you would expect. Upon entering an
incorrect response and pressing -NEXT-, the student's
response is erased (so far, so good). However, at this
point the markup, "no", is written in mode erase in sized
writing just after the students response. Apparently, PLATO
forgot that it did not do the markup in the first place,
and does not now need to remove the "no". This apparently
happens only when using other then -size-0- at an arrow.?
   I only noticed this because I had other writing
displayed at the location where the -no- usually appears
and it was being messed up. Any chance for a fix?
Thanks,

Yes, there are ways around it, but if it IS an error, it
SHOULD be fixed, regardless of whether you can sneak your
way around it or not. After all, specs nookno and noword
do two different things: specs affects just the arrow you're
at, but -noworo- remains in effect unit you either
encounter another -noword- or leave the lesson, so that
if you have something like this:
back    review
arrow   anywhere
noword
answer  whatever
endarrow
noword  no
...and the student hits BACK before answering the question,
the noword is set to blank for every arrow in the whole
rest of the lesson, unless the student is fortunate enough
to encounter another-noword- somewhere. Thus, there is a
very important difference between specs nookno and noword
and I think care should be taken in advising people to use
the latter in place of the former.

With reference to note ¬$236 about a micro table not being
loaded, I'm looking for suggestions:?
What does a lesson DO when zreturn after a -micro-
command indicates the micro table not loaded?
Is the following code reasonable?
1try
micro   lesson.block
branch  zreturn,1ok,z
return
branch  1try
1ok

By the way, it never occured to me before to test zreturn
after a -micro- command; I know the micro block exists,
so it will be loaded. Perhaps with ECS the way it is,
that assumption is invalid.?
Also, Elaine Avner's "Summary" (2nd edition) does not
mention zreturn (or error) re. -micro-. Is this a new
feature of the -micro- command?

Regarding your last point (about "error" not being mentioned

up with the conversion to "zreturn". Sorry if the omission

According to marty/mfl (who has a BIG interest in micro-
tables), the non-loading of microtables was a real problem
which Blomme fixed last night. Any new problems should
be reported!

I don't know about using zreturn to try a reload.
---------- response 4
  02/24/76     18.31     blomme       s

   No, the problem with micro tables mentioned by
Judy has NOTHING to do with this. The new term handling
temporarily had an adverse affect by clearing a flag
it shouldn't have--this was fixed immediately.
   The error return indicating loading/non-loading of
a micro table has been present in the system ever since
the micro command existed I think--however, I believe it
is the case that this particular error return was not
mentioned in aids for some time. I seem to recall finding
that omission when I was adding "zreturn"s everywhere.
There are several reasons why loading might fail, the
most common/obvious being the non-existence of the
specified lesson or of the micro block. I would think
looping to re-try would be appropriate, provided some
sort of indication of the failure and some means of
"giving up" were provided.

---------- response 5
  02/24/76     22.37     rader       s

After a brief check through the code, it would seem that
looping on "zreturn" is not the best idea--the shortage
of ecs situation produces internal looping (which you
could escape with a stop1), not a zreturn value. The
other error exits appear to be of a nature that should
be reproducible--such as microtable not found. All I can
suggest at present is that instances of microtables not
being found when they are in fact there be reported,
including circumstances. A system/pso person should
be contacted to look at the problem while it is still
fresh, if possible.

       don't make multiple copies of a single page, as it
is cheaper (and faster) to use a xerox or equivalent on the
first copy.

        i've seen a user copy pages and pages of solid text
in size 0 rotated 90¬o so it would be written on the page the

For those who wonder WHY one would want the v-format
("julian") date instead of the alpha format, consider that
the julian day permits one to specify the date and time
(to a fraction of a second) all in one word and thus
allows easy computation of elapsed times with special
checks to prevent errors that can occur when data are
lost (e.g.--a "stop" time that is one hour earlier than
the "start" time--because it is actually from the following
day and the other times were lost). Even knowing that a
student has not been present for 7.4 days, it is nice to
also know what the last calendar date of attendance was.

---------- response 2
  02/24/76     19.32     clark       lawyer

A very subtle error! Apparently PLATO does not like to
have operators in the parens of the varloc function. It
treats the operator as if it were a paren! That is why
varloc(4?n10)=0 and varloc(n10?4)=10: in the first one,
PLATO takes varloc of 4 (which = 0)...in the second one,
PLATO takes varloc of n10 which is 10. NOW, in your
define, you have Funct(i)=(i?5). Then you have in
the varloc, Funct(F), which is, rewritten, n10?5. PLATO
sees the n10 and quits. If you change your define to
read Funct(i)=(5?i), then, varloc(Funct(F))=0! Perhaps
there should be a condense error when operators are put
into the varloc function.

The change to this set-up is twofold better. Allowing
the choice of sites to be displayed allows one to skip
the uselessly large amount of listing of author-users.
This cuts down a lot on system's overhead. The other
is that a person does not necessarily want to see who
is at site 0 out would only like to see those on at site
27. This saves on both user time and system time(re-
sources).

Now, having the choice directly available upon entry to
the U option skips the unnecessary display of the first
page of users here the option to not be implemented until
after the entire first page had been displayed.... It is
a simple thing to choose a complete list by one keypress.

I would like the new way better if there were a handy site/
course directory, so one would know what sites to access:
as it is, I have to run all the sites to find out if some
particular person is on, since I have no idea which sites
are likely to contain which courses.

        I agree with Mike (see responce 5), I too would
like the idea of specifying an initial site number, from
which, the list would begin, but instead of only listing
that site, continue to list for the entire length of the
screen. Also, I think it would be nice if when going
through the list one site at a time, if when you hit
next to go to the next site, you were taken to the next
site with terminals in use by users who have their users
flag on. This would stop the displaying of totally blank
screens.

---------- note 328 piecewise-
  02/25/76     01.13     kent       unl

        I am interested in the situation where an author
wishes to provide a student with the ability to enter a
piecewise continuous function. Now the only way I know of
doing this at the present is a rather messy structure of
conditionally executed -compute-s. Therefore I would like
to propose the following new command and modification of
an old command which I think would greatly facilitate this:

        First I would like to propose an -index- command:

index ndex,xval,vector

Here, vector is a vector containing the values of the
boundaries of each sub-interval of the piece-wise contin-
uous function. The command would "search for the location"
of xval in vector and store the result in ndex: ndex=-1 if
xval not in range; ndex=0 if vector(1)¬<xval¬<vector(2); etc.

(continued in first response)

---------- response 1
  02/25/76     01.22     kent       unl
       Next I would like to propose the following modifi-
cation to the -calcs- and -calcc- commands:

calcs ndex,y?,,<pointr1>,<pointr2>,<poin...

Here, pointr1, pointr2, etc., are the pointers set when
the -compute- command is first executed (the fourth argu-
ment) and the brackets, <>, indicate that the condensed
code indicated by these pointers is to be executed; rather
than the usual meaning.

         Of course these are only suggested formats, but
I think something along these lines could be _very_ conven-
ient under the circumstances mentioned.

        Any comments, official or otherwise?

---------- response 2
  02/25/76     11.20     b sherwood       s

Sounds bizarre to me, but maybe I don't understand what
problem you are trying to solve.

In case it is related to your problem, I might mention that
one way to code a piece-wise function is like this:

-(x<3)[3xˆ2-5sin(x)]-[(x¬>3) $and$ (x<5)][-4x]-(x¬>5)[exp (x)]

---------- response 3
  02/25/76     23.52     kent       unl

        But that's not going to help in this situation.
I want to let the student be able to key in a piecewise
function: He would have to give the number of sub-intervals
(pieces)--this+1 would be the length of vector. Next, he
would key in the value of each sub-interval boundary. Then
he would key in the algebraic expressions denoting the
functional values in each sub-interval. These expressions
would be condensed by a -compute- statement.
        As it stands now, evaluating such a student-given
piecewise function is messy but with my suggestion, the
following code would be possible given that the values of
vector and the pointers had been specified as implied above:

doto  1loop,x?val1,val2,dx
index ndex,x,vector
goto  ndex,errunit,x
calcs ndex,y?<pointr1>,<pointr2....
      (other code)
1 loop
      Now just try to do that with current TUTOR!

---------- response 4
  02/26/76     15.29     shirer       vu

   Just try doing that with some other language!

Can't really see that such a specialized situation would
be of general interest. Remember that PLATO doesn't
promise to do everything with one line of code...but we
try to make the most used features available in the
simplest manner. I think that the multiple computes are
probably as simple a way as any other in this case.

If the types of functions are restricted to just a few
general cases...sines, exps, powers,etc....I can think
of an easier way to do it...p-note me if interested.

---------- response 5
  02/26/76     23.30     kent       unl

        You _can_ do that in at least one other language that
I know of: APL/CMS--a language which runs on IBM's VM/370.
And it _can_ do it on _just_ _one_ _line_ _of_ _code_!
        The "execute operator", T=¬o, is a handy little
critter: it will take any input character string and
execute it as APL code--and that makes it VERY powerful!
        And as for limited usefulness; well, TUTOR is
loaded with commands--many of which are not used by very
many authors. My personal opinion is that this would be
sufficiently useful to be justified. Notice that this
isn't the only use of my ideas: They do serve to expand
the power and versatility of TUTOR.

---------- response 6
  02/27/76     15.22     mailman       ustaf

        Sigh. The philosophy of PLATO seems to be: if you
want to do something, invent a command to do it. We can
all see the results: how many commands are there now in
TUTOR? Is there any hope for a language for PLATO which is
based upon a small number of very powerful commands rather
that kludging up a new command to meet every new contin-
gency?

---------- response 7
  02/29/76     03.06     kent       unl

        It seems there is already something close to my
-index- command in TUTOR (see note no. 531). With that
suggested extension to the -find- command and my suggested
extension to the -calcs- and -calcc- commands, we would
be making TUTOR a more powerful language--without "kludging"
up any new commands, just making the old ones more powerful.

---------- note 336 more micro
  02/25/76     09.27     marty       mfl

To continue note 267 about micro tables not loading.
An occasional cause is that the student hits the STOP
key by accident while the table is loading. The lesson is
then entered with the table not loaded. In this case,
no check can be made (at least, at present) since the
value of zreturn in that instance is -1.
zreturn should be set to -1 only when the micro table
is completely loaded.
---------- response 1
  02/25/76     11.21     b sherwood       s

The STOP key has no effect on the loading of micro tables,
which are not sent to the terminal itself. The STOP key
aborts output sent to terminals, not internal operations.

---------- response 2
  02/25/76     20.37     blomme       s

   I am not quite so positive in my judgment, although a
fairly careful examination of the coding which handles the
micros and charsets, together with some testing leads me
to believe that:
(1) STOP should not affect the loading of micros--i,e.,
  that key should be ignored and any micro failure should
  be due to some other reason (and should be flagged as
  a failure).
(2) STOP _does_ stop the loading of a charset--however, the
  value for "zreturn" in this case is 1 (an error) and
  not -1 (loaded ok). Also, a chartst command executed
  after such an abort of a charset load will indicate that
  the charset is NOT loaded.

   It can even be dangerous! Sometimes I type "IS2", and
it only gets "S2", which destroys the saved lines. The
precautions to take are obvious ("Look before you NEXT"?),
but....
   I, too, assume it happens to everyone; it DOESN'T just
happen on these newer keysets, does it?

   It couldn't be caused by hitting keys too quickly, since
It's usually the first keys that are ignored. (Or could
the second interfere with the first?) My superstitious
impression has always been that I hit the key too "abruptly"
(hitting instead of pressing), but don't comment on that,
because I don't believe it. ¬??-- Dan

Most of these editor control keys are going in at a
pause, and it is quite possible to lose one (or more)--
your best protection at present is to wait until you see
what you typed before pressing NEXT!

If you miss keys while inserting or replacing text in the
editor, you must be either typing very fast or have some
other problem (keyset, line errors,....).

Thank you, Ruth, for the spiffy (and quite useful) new
data sorting options in the datafile machinery.

I hope also that systems staff is considering (soon) some
sort of facilities to accomplish the following:
1) Sorting of data by student prior to printout.
2) The analysis of summary stats (similar to the PEER
   package) as mentioned in "projects".
3) Providing some means of getting more legible numeric
   info into the datafile. The current scheme of octal
   and a VERY short field integer ¬+ floating nos. (w/out-
   putl) is, ah, frustrating and frequently practically
   useless.

Nonetheless, this most recent addition is welcome indeed.

I agree with Tim. The new data sorting feature is going
to be useful to many. But don't stop there. Head copy from
the datafile is impossible to use now but the ability to
have it sorted and printed would be a great aid. It is
almost impossible to do all data review on line and the hard
copy available doesn't aid in reviewing the data as it now
stands.
The other points in Tim's note should also be worked on in
making the student data collection on PLATO truely useful.

Let's see the student data area of PLATO grow with the rest
of the system.

To clarify my point ¬$ 3, Ruth: yes, the display generated
by the datafile editor is inadequate for showing the
numeric information generated by outputl's. Specifically,
it is only capable of showing relatively small integer
and floating values. In some cases I can see where the
current format (octal, integer, floating) is useful; in
others it is desireable only to see an integer or floating
or octal value. Perhaps some new variations on the
-outputl- command are in order:
-outputl- to dump vars to datafile w/current format;
-outputo- to dump only octal
-outputi- to dump only in integer
-outputf- to dump only in floating
-outputa- for alph
At any rate, the important thing to me in this area is
being able to see a floating or integer value carried to
a larger number of places.

 ---------- response 6

While outputo/a/n is being considered the folowing would be
be useful:

1) Allow us to set what format to show outputl's in like
the common editor does (any combination of a,n,o,v ).

2) -reado- to read output (not outputl) from the file.
So far we almost have access to all the information in
the file but (unless I missed a new system feature buried
in replies to notes) so far no access to output.

The PEER package is now being expanded and consolidated
(primarily by Tamar Weaver) to allow use of datasets for
storage, editing, and analysis of selected area and
output data (in a relativley restricted format--but at
very low cost to te user in terms of setting up data
handling procedures). This package is, of course, intended
mainly for early analysis of lesson data for initial
revisions. It is expected that each user will want to
subsequently design a tailored package to suit their own
needs (which would make use of some of the other suggestions
made earlier here). Al Avner

Al: the PEER package is indeed a powerful one, but it is
very expensive (in terms of disk space and ECS) relative to
a widely used system-level lesson (like the savings involved
in using "mrouter"). The poor guy running a one part course
with a 4 part datafile and perhaps 5 two part lessons is
probably not that enthusiastic about going thru the trouble
of adding a dataset to his collection and a couple of
"dummy" lesson spaces (to contain the -use- commands).
While the PEER package will continue to be most useful to
many people, I feel very strongly that the system should
still expand and improve its own handling of student per-
formance data.

---------- response 10
  02/26/76     11.12     t weaver       peer

The PEER package no longer needs the use command or commons.
One lesson will serve all at the same time. Datasets are
the only space needed, The ECS needed to run is lower
than 3000 words, and each user will have a storage of about
1300 in the most used parts of the package. An option for
printout sumaries in reasonable looking tables is available
too. Will probably be released in April.
(More information will be available at that time.)

In addition, the main purpose of the datasets is to store
data from the datafiles (in squeezed form) for periods
of several weeks. There is thus no alternative to them
given that you wish to save data from several datafiles
(in order to make comparisons over time, etc.). As Tamar
points out, the only overhead will be an ECS load during
processing. This would be present even with systems
level lessons (even if hidden from view by fictional 1500
word lesson lengths). Al

---------- note 351 ansv idea
  02/25/76     11.24     p cohen       med

Dear s(ystems):
        A very frequent use of the -ansv- command is to
see if an input lies within a certain range rather than
if it equals a number within a certain error limit.
        If an author wants to see if an input is between
¬a and ¬b, his only recourse is to use to customary:

ansv    (¬b+¬a)2,(¬b-¬a)/2

which is rather obscure for so simple an idea.
        How about another command such as:

rangev  ¬a,¬b

to cover this case. Is it possible? Any sentiments?

        Good idea, It is far more useful to define a range
of numbers thn a tolerance in most cases...
but instead of a new command, how about a different ansv
tag, say
ansv    3,5,2.5 becomes equal to
ansv    1;6 or
ansv    1,6,range

I certainly favor it. Your proposed name sounds ok. except
what would be the name of the complementary command which
would do a "judge wrong"? How about -ansr-/-wrongr-??

A related suggestion from users has been for a judging
command which would be matched if the tag was -1:

arrow   1215
store   x
test    x>3  $and$ ntries<5
write   ......

(Your range case is so common that it seems worthwhile
just by itself, of course.)

I also agree with warner about using -ansv-.
Er...um...mathematical usage would suggest:

ansv (¬a,¬b)

for all inputs strictly between ¬a and ¬b and:

ansv (¬a,¬b)
to include the endpoints as well.

   An -ansv- range is clearly an innovation which could 
benifit many people. Would the difference between
ansv 10,2
and
ansv 10;12
be easily apparent to most authors? That seems simplest
to implement.

 I like Paul's idea too and I have some further suggestions.
It would be nice if you could specify two or more allowable
ranges in a ansv. Being able to use ¬?¬=¬? and -¬?¬=¬? as endpoints
of the ranges would also be usefull. Then an author wanting
the student to input values for the equation ¬[ln x/(x-7)¬]
would only need:

ansv (0,7),(7,¬?¬=¬?)

the 15-minute tape is _much_ cleaner than the few-minute
tape. Simple inspection suggests that the few-minute

The provision to allow student speakers at this conference

to encourage the Computer Science department here to hold
an annual program review consisting totally of student
presentations preceded by brief faculty introductions.
Such activities provide valuable graduate training.

However, you guys at Indiana really need to improve the
preliminary program you mailed out. At minimum, it should
contain the titles of the talks and the names of the 
speakers. Just citing broad subject areas gives the

         First of all, there is no such systems variable as
"lesnam". Therefore I presume you are defining it as a
defined variable, and setting it when the student leaves
his lesson for the comments section.
        This variable must be getting clobbered somewhere,
that is, being altered after you enter the comments section.
Look for places. where the variable is redefined as another
name (remember that n** and v** refer to the same number.)
Especially look for a place where a variable is set to 50,
since an integer variable containing 50 will show up as 'j'.

I have also used successfully a lesson name obtained from
a leslist number and -lname- command (don't forget to
reference the 2nd word returned by the -lname-, or for
safety, reference all 3 words).

  As I understand it, the updating of the condense
priority is dependant on the size of the lesson you
are trying to condense. If you never reach the
condensor, the size of the lesson is unknown, and
updating prioritys is difficult. Therefore, I assume
stop1ing out of the queue is harmless. Someone correct

Your condense priority depends only on the amount of

have been on and the same facts for the others who wish to
condense. You lose nothing but a key-press by entering the

The contest will run until Friday, March 5, at 5 PM.
Sorry, the older, non-winning entries from the first tape
contest were not saved.

Until the system allows the conversion of -linesets- into
a series of commands (like -char- commands), we will not be
able to allow the use of linesets in the contest. The
entries must be completely self-contained and we cannot
afford to have them dependent on other lessons (for char-
sets or linesets) nor do _we_ want to carry around a large

How smart is the condensor?
If I define the following:

will the condensor change +2+start to +14?

         Is this a new change?? I had always heard that the
defines were a straight replacement. So that 2+start would
be replaced by 2+12 and not 14. The reason I ask is that I
tried to use a similar define in an array, and the condensor
didn't like it.

Well, it likes my !arrays" (don shirer's matrix arrays).
I don't know where you had problems, but using defined
constants works.

Yes, condensing is just text substitution, but later when
the text is compiled into machine code it optimizes
constants like 2+12.

If condensing is just text substitution, why the requi-
rement that the substituted string must make sense when
enclosed in parentheses, which means that
        define plus=+
is illegal? This is not a useful example, but I have
had cases where the ability to do this kind of thing would
have been quite useful...

---------- response 5
  02/27/76     17.45     white       p

Paul, because it is just text substitution, if we didn't
insert the parenthesis, the following might occur:

define index=base+offset
...
calc   n1?index*row

which would be: n1?base+offset*row
or, after operator priority: n1?base+(offset*row),
which is clearly not wanted in most cases.

Thus, we insert the parenthesis around our internal
representation of the text before substitution.

Yes, a division by zero will cause an execution error in

Actually, I think the command field search would be just
as fast as it presently is. It uses a -find- command, thus
it can only find commands whose first character is the
first character in a word. This is the case in the
indenting.

---------- response 5
  02/27/76     11.34     tenczar       s

indenting has such huge ramifications that we are going
very slowly and trying to find the "best" way of doing it.
the current "micro-i" method is just an attempt to see
what one sort of implementation would look like/invlove.
it is incomplete in that it needs further programming in
the editor with respect to many of the search options and
needs a lot of work in our system "change" programs that
change all TUTOR source code to a different form once we
decide upon changes to TUTOR (e.g, like the soon to come
removal of the x-y-coordinates from the tag of the -circle-
command).

while the current method has some benefits, it also has
drawbacks...like all the damn typing of "¬D "!
another method being studied would require some special
marker on the continued lines of those TUTOR commands that
can have the "special" continued lines...like -write-
cont.

e.g.,
            write   Hello there, Sue. Please
                    write me a letter!

the second line above is very "strange" in that it is an
"internal" continuation of the previous -write- command
and interpreted just as a "CR".
If "free-form" indenting was allowed...then the second line
would be ambiguous...should it be interpreted in the
"CR" mode, or does it represent another -write- statement:
        write me a letter!

another form of indenting being studied would force one
to put a marker on continued lines of commands with
internal continuations:
        write   Hello there Sue.
        ¬W     write me a letter!
then, there would be no ambiguity to free-form indenting
of the first word on a line.

---------- response 7
  02/27/76     11.49     tenczar       s

1.

write   Yep, Quite a great man!

                ¬W     Adam's...

Currently, the problems of NOT using some kind of mark and
fixed-distance between command and tag, are beyond our
thoughts...

---------- response 8
  02/27/76     11.54     tenczar       s

---------- response 9
  02/27/76     13.11     judy       pso

As for micro-TAB, that is "reserved" for backwards
writing (when it comes). I think that instead of TAB
you would press micro-TAB, and lo-and-behold, you'll
be going leftwards from the right margin.

---------- response 10
  02/27/76     13.51     tenczar       s

well, if we get indenting...then maybe micro-tab should
be indenting and micro-B should be backwards...surely
backwards will be infrequently invoked in author mode by
most authors and automatically invoked (ala force backward)
in student mode

  02/27/76     16.06     j wilson       unidel

Thanks much for the explanation. I'm happy with
either suggested appearance of indenting, and would
like the C-search to find indented commands if it's not
too expensive.

To me, MICRO-TAB sounds good for indenting,
and MICRO-? good for right to left writing.

---------- response 12
  02/27/76     16.42     david       hebrew

Why does indenting seem to be a prerequisite for
putting IF-THEN-ELSE into TUTOR?

It appears to be the same as saying "indenting is a
prerequisite for putting regular commands which are
contingent upon judging commands into TUTOR".

To be sure,

arrow  505
answer indent
write  Good
wrong  micro i
write  Use -indent-
endarrow

is more readable than without indenting, but it
makes no difference in terms of the utility of the
abstract concept of answer-contingent writing.

Ah, but one DOES perform unneeded condenses (and downgrade

it. I for one have often thought I would like such a

What about presenting a message such as:

Binary unavailable----entering condense queue

for 2 - 3 seconds. If the author pressed -stop1- while
on that display, he would be returned to his code;
otherwise he would enter the condense queue.

Would that brief delay be objectionable to others?
Would reducing condensing by a small amount be helpful?

A suggestion (that I think I made before):

How about allowing one-argument tags for the -cstop- and
-cstart- commands? The argument would have to be a
numerical expression that evaluates to a constant. If it
evaluates to -1, the command has its usual effect. Any
other value causes the command to be ignored.
        This would be of value mainly to writers of -use-d
code, effectively allowing them to parameterize their
routines. This can be done now only by putting seperate
components in differently-named blocks, but this can
be clumsy and wasteful in many situations.
        So how about it? (If it's impossible for some
reason or other, apologies in advance).

telling the name of the lesson you are currently in? It
would also be useful for lessons using other lessons.

This was proposed before, while the systems staff was
considering moving to multi-word lesson names, and so
instead of a reserved word with the lesson name, we got
one with the leslist number. But this is less than 100;
satisfactory: what about a block of -use-d code intended
for the use of anybody on the system? Obviously, a leslist
of all the -use-ing lessons would be impossible. So how
about a reconsideration, please, systems?

I have often wished that the -find- command were a bit
more versatile. For example, I want to look for the first
word that is NOT equal to, say, zero. Wouldn't it be
possible to allow a format like this:

find   object,start,length,return,incr,mask,¬a

where  ¬a is a member of ¬[=,¬=,<,>¬], meaning "find the
first value that stands in the given relationship to the
object". The default would of course be =, so only those
authors using the extra argument would be affected.

I have a feeling that the ¬= would be easier to add than
the others. Do I hear a second?

next someunit(34,yourmom,iflag)

---------- response 2
  02/27/76     22.37     b sherwood       s

Nope. The branching command is executed at the time it is
encountered, and merely places a unit name in the associated
marker word. Then, later, when the student presses HELP
or DATA, we look at the help- or data-associated marker
word to decide where to go. There really is no way there-
fore in the present structure to allow for an argument
list for each control key. And would the arguments be
evaluated when the command was executed, or when the
function key was pressed?

After much consultation, character set "charsetx,russian"
has been cleaned up to contain only the basic letters
and punctuation marks necessary for typing Russian
sentences. This set is essentially compatible with
that used in the UI Russian lessons. One minor change
was made: the soft sign was moved from the minus key
to the 6 key, where it is next to the hard sign (on the 5),
it looks like a 6, and it is not taken by TUTOR to be
a punctuation mark.

How about this: Changing the length of a permanent common.

Blocks of common could be added at the end of the existing
common blocks, and blocks (or chunks of words) could be
taken off of the beginning or end of existing commons.

This is possible to do now, but it requires extra space
(with copy a block etc). And just now, lacking the space
in the lesson the common was in, I had to use a different
lesson. With problems involving different security codes,
different common codes. forgotten common codes, and moving
between lessons, the whole operation took ten minutes
instead of the 30 seconds it should have.
(nice sob story, isn't it!=?)

Wagle is correct, changing the common to source is

Actually, I'm glad it's now done. I once spent all day
trying to figure out why a -draw- would't work right.
I had inadvertently defined a variable called "skip".
thus overriding the system definition, but had forgotten
about it since there was no system warning. This discus-
sion does, however, point to the desireablity of allowing
programs to turn off condense WARNINGS -- not ERRORS --;
it is frustrating to have to change a variable name in an
old working lesson in order to avoid the condense error
page. I know students do not see the page, but authors do,
and such unneeded warnings are annoying.

your classes? A way to leave notes for the whole class
to read, such as a description of the next exam assignment,
or a change to a printed handout? Well, here's your
chance to set one up with a minimum of effort.?
Lesson "bulletin" is now available for -use- by other
lessons. It provides a bulletin board editor (highly
graphical, an elaboration of principles pioneered by
lesson "service" and the SS and SD options of the system 
lesson editor). It also provides a small lesson for the
students to read the bulletin board. Messages may be
created. edited, and destroyed as required by the
instructor, even while the students are reading them.?

---------- note 561 indent
  02/28/76     15.20     obrien       uicc

I have been having thoughts as regards structured pro-
gramming in TUTOR, mainly because I've been earning my
bread working with a structured language. As Paul has been
pointing out, TUTOR always has been a structured language.
Well and good. The "indent" feature is designed to make
the code more readable to humans, thereby allowing one who
does not live in symbiosis with TUTOR to have a reasonable
chance at reading TUTOR code. Also well and good. And,
should TUTOR ever get if-then-else-while structures, it
will be almost mandatory to have an indented format in
order to make TUTOR readable by anyone, even the author.
All true.

        However, the current method of indenting will
make it all but impossible to use for all but "showcase"
examples as long as disk allocations are fixed in length.

                *cont.*

---------- response 1
  02/28/76     15.26     obrien       uicc

The main reason for this claim is that the current indent
feature eats up almost one word per indentation, whereas
in almost all other systems, each indent eats up only
one character (the TAB character, which PLATO lacks).
Therefore, if we consider the average structured program
which uses indenting, we will find that it can eat up to
two to two and a half times the "white space" (black space,
on one of these brown boxes) as it would if it were not
indented. On PLATO, each such space is a character, so
lessons which use this feature as freely as it should be
used will eat up quite large amounts of lesson space.
Therefore, either the structuring itself will not be used
(best case), or "hot-shots" will use it to write unreadable
code (worst case).

        At a minimum, therefore, I ask that consideration
be given to the implementation of a TAB character on
PLATO.

I recently asked for help trying to figure out what could
be causing errtype=2 returns to my router's error unit.
Errtype=2 is supposed to mean "fatal condense error",
but not "no ECS". Well, it just happened to me.?
I was signed on with a student record, and tried to
execute a certain lesson. After waiting for it to
condense (seemed like a rather long wait after the
"now preparing lesson" message stopped flashing), my
router reported errtype=2! I retried it several times;
each time I got a very quick response with same message.
As soon as I could, I got in with an author signon and
condensed the lesson; no problem at all" (There is
absolutely NO possibility that anyone else could have
edited the lesson.)?
I know it's non-prime time, but this doesn't seem to
depend on which version of Plato is running.?
Can anyone suggest a cause?

first, all your samples have lines that are of "fixed

of indent to command (or next indent)...it would be nice
to see what people thought of "free form" indenting...
(by the way, the current unannounced indenting method "¬D"
would have been "." if I had realized that ". backspace ,!
used 3 characters as well as "¬D"...since I wanted the whole
indenting "package" to use 10 characters = 1 word, and hence
be trivial to implement and execute)

On the non prime-time version. autosigned terminals
are allowing only the autosigned records to be used
at those terminals - ie: no other records can sign
on.

I thought that autosigning was for convenience, rather
than restriction.

Is this change intentional?

Is there a maximum limit on the disk size a condensable

For instance. is a 10-part lesson ever condensable, even

also.

       I believe that the largest condensible lesson is
six parts. I have good reason to know that the largest
lesson binary allowed is 10,000 words. A binary which is
about this length will give a "Lesson binary almost too
long" warning. If you get this warning, it means that any
changes to the condensor might push your lesson over the
absolute maximum binary size and make it uncondensable.

What is the absolute limit of the lesson binary? Many times
in many lessons I've seen the warning sign and the lesson
binary has usually been around 10100 words or so. How much
leeway is allowed?
Also, it might be beneficial to all authors to know that
some commands, while very neat in coding, are very costly
in terms of lesson binary. Is there anything to tell one
this information? I'm thinking mostly of people who suffer
this warning message and would like to economize their
lesson binary a bit.

If you really want to see a large lesson try 'pizza'. The

Those large files will condense if the last physical

If GNOTE files become accessible to -jumpout-, would it
be possible to make their special nature completely

Well, this can certainly be changed. However, the kind of
data on student-lesson interactions normally collected
in datafiles is really much more informative to lesson
authors engaged in debugging / revising lessons than it
is to instructors. since it interpretation depends on a

There is considerable flexibility here, but a few

Most notably. in the section in which signons are added
and access options specified or changed, please put in a
single key (NEXT1?) which will move from one signon to
the next within one course list, or from one course to
the next within the list of courses. As it is now, one
must back from a signon and type in the next one, and then
must back from one course and type in the next course.?
Also, when creating a new course, could you initialize
its signon list to be the same as that for course Other,
including all user types listed there, and including the
access rights for each. This would make adding a new
course and one name much easier, by eliminating the need
to type in all the O, A, S, etc. entries.

---------- response 1

Also, it would be nice to have a -long 1- at the arrows
at which course names and signon names are entered, with
judging like that at the AUTHOR MODE arrow, so that if
a capital letter is entered (O, A, S, I, M), it will
be recognized immediately, but if anything else is
entered, it will execute a longer -long- and -judge exit-.

        There seems to me to be some hassle with using
-help--type.units (esp. -term-) in lessons other than page-
turners: namely, their insistance on returning to the UNIT
they were called from. If you do anything between the
-unit- command and the -pause-. -arrow-, or -unit- command
that permitted the branch, it will be repeated; and this
can be disastrous if not provide for.
       -Entry a- -base a- doesn't do the job
elegantly, since it activates 'backs' and may require a
-base - later. -inhibit term- helps, but doesn't
adequate.
       The simplest thing I'd like to see would be a
command like -helpb- (for helpbase), which would (like
base or restart)specify a point (entry as well as unit)
to which -terms- and other help-sequences entered before
the next -unit- or -base- would return, without the bizarre

99: of the time when I get INSPECT ONLY. it is because
I forgot to enter the right change code. I would really
prefer to be stopped before I even got into the lesson
with a page that said:

INSPECT ONLY

Enter CHANGE CODE or press NEXT to INSPECT ¬6

         would be fine, consistant with the author mode

(could S be made available form the block list as well as

I know this ain't no democracy, but I think Maggs' sugges-
tion is a very good one. Of course, the extra page should
be skipped if the user has selected INSPECT ONLY b pressing
LAB instead of NEXT on the author mode page.
   I note, by the way, that if you _have_ pressed LAB instead
of NEXT on the author mode page, and then wish to switch
to EDIT mode, that pressing SHIFT BACK takes you to the
"Type the security code..." page instead of right into EDIT
mode--even if the security code is already the correct one.

        I agree with maggs ¬+ wilson.
Everyone (especially new authors) fail to realize they
are in inspect mode, and are going to have to enter
the security code anyway. Stopping them before they enter
the block listing is not and extra page.
        The additional burden to those who are entering
a lesson in inspect mode and did not press lab would be
insignificant compared to a the time lost ploting additional
information.

Some thoughts:

How many other places is DATA1 the access key for security
code change (e.g. records editor)? Will they be changed to
BACK1 too? What are the relative frequencies for changing
security codes vs. changing standard charset/micro loading
for a lesson? How much convenience do we need for access
to each of these pages?

thanks for pointing out this very subtle error...
it relates to a logical error in the execution of the
concept command...currently, if a word in not perfectly
matched, then a search is made through a list of "common"
words (like: the, there, where, this, etc) to see if the
word matches one of these...this is done so that the
"speller" part of the concept command doesn't call a
"misspell" to a common word (e.g., there and three, where
and were, etc)...then, finally, the "speller" (which also
finds capitalization errors) is called into play.

it seems fairly obvious from your example that the
capitalization checks should precede the "common"
vocabulary checks. I will try to fix this sonnest. thanks

A question about lesson "crash".

At the present time, this lesson reports that there have
been no prime-time interruptions this month. However, I
also note that a 50 minute crash at 7:41 yesterday should
have carried over until 8:31, which is prime time. Is the
data on prime-time interruption, etc., based only on
crashes which occur during ptime, and not on those which
actually occur earlier but nevertheless effect ptime use?
This seems a bit illogical--the data would be more realistic
if ptime downtime were included, no matter when the crash
began.

Comments, please.

Also, there is a distinction between a true "crash" (an
interruption of service that has begun) and a delay in
start of service (for which we also have an example this
month). A true crash has distinctly different sorts of
problems and we don't want the two types of data to be
mixed up. On the other hand, such delays must be indicated
in the total; of time available. There is no single
measure of system reliability that summarizes all problems
without losing information so we provide several measures.

be advisable for someone (the PSO staff?) to make up several
standard edit micro's that would facilitate different types

The reason I suggest this is because I sense that the

PSO is indeed planning a library of microtables, similar
to the library of charsets, There is some preliminary
work that needs to be done, for instance, a consistent
naming procedure. Lesson "microtable" is being replaced
by lesson "micros". As useful microtables, microtables
needed for use with special charsets, etc. become available,
we will include them in "micros", muchs as charsets with
some universal appeal are now in lesson "charsets" (we are
working on getting lesson "charsets" to be the only library
lesson for charsets). We may also then be able to provide
some help for using the charsets and microtables as well.

For experimental purposes, would like to design
moderately interesting task which is simulation of real
word job for which subject receives monetary
reinforcement [preferably not learning program or game].
Task duration: up activity but could also be run in its

therefore success on task should not be apparent to

This "feature" was very nice when, for example, you
have just dumped data from 40 datafiles, and now have
to zero each one by hand... to live with this kludgey
datafile machinery, we wrote a little program which
maintains a list of all our datafiles. Then by simply
entering that lesson, n1 would be stuffed with the
next datafile on the list and a jumpout (blank) executed.
A simple press of NEXT took you directly into the datafile.

DATAFILES UNDER PROGRAM CONTROL!

     While we are on the subject of lesson names, why not

Such a term could be quite useful in determining the name of

Do you have any idea how many people would literally

was currently in use... or if datafiles could be extended

  The system tries to keep lesson names a secret of
sorts, silly as it may seem. That's why there isnt, and
probably wont be a system term which does so. Myself,
I think they shouldnt even TRY to do so or else
should do a ultragood job of it....as it is, a large
percentage of people can find out what lesson they are
in via course records and/or site options. I think
that all security of this sort should be left to the
individual author. After all, they can easily restrict
access. Even specify which lesson you have
to come from to enter if they want.

Under some lighting conditions, reflections from the
terminal screen may be a nuisance. The general solution
to this problem is to eliminate light sources which
propagate at an angle of 45¬0 or less (to horiz.)
A specific, ellegant solution for recessed flourescents
is to use a diffusor which transmits light only (nearly)
straight down (at least >45¬0 to horiz.).
The billiard room of the Illini Union (UIUC) uses such
diffusors. Thanks to Jim Payne (Foreign Languages),
the sourse of these diffusors has been found:
typical price are for 2'?4' polystyrene--$22.;
acrylic--$31. whereas common diffusors are $5, and $9.

the trw compilers use high TIPS, and are currently being

     This has probably been suggested before, but how about
a system -term- that displays the current values of mallot
and muse? Such a -term- (-term ecs- I suppose) would be a
great boon in large notefiles(cscomments is a good example,
it takes more than 10,000 words,) where the threat of being
suddenly backed out toward the end of a long note is quite
real(and annoying.) I am aware that the authors of those
files could install such a term themselves, but they are not
doing it. Also, -term ecs- could be of immeasurable benefit
in a lesson where it is difficult find where you were when
you left. Thirdly, the complaint is often heard that game
players ( at sites where they are allowed) are inconsiderate
in regard to how much ecs is available. A -term ecs- would
allow them to check how much they are using without messing
up their score or position in the game.

     Yes, but the inference that game players "don't give
a damn" about ECS is based primarily on the observation of
how they act in regard to it. Such are observations have
been made, necessarily, under conditions where a game player
must give up his position in the game just to find out if
there _is_ an ECS crunch. It is rather inconceivable that any
game player, no matter how ECS conscious heShe is, would be
inclined to give up his/her position in the game without.
some indication that a shortage actually exists. Therefore,
one cannot make an accurate prediction as to how a game
player would act if he/she had something like -term ecs- to
keep him/her informed of shortages that arise.
     Also, I wish to emphasize that the effect on game play-
ing is only one of the benefits that I mentioned. Too often

We'll also be developing a library of micro tables in file
"micros". Table "standard" in file "micros" is the stand-
ard default micro table. (The default micro table was
formerly lesson "microtable", block "standard".)

The alphabets library which was formerly scattered among
"charsetx", "charsets", and "charsett" is now in file
"charsets". This means that for the present, there are
some pairs of character sets in "charsets" which differ

charset "standard".) The duplicate character sets will
be destroyed in two weeks. There is a table of corres-
pondences of old and new names in block 7-a of "charsets".

A system conversion will be run, but if you can make the
necessary changes yourself to your lessons, please do so.

We hope the inconvenience of the changes will be out-

HOT OFF THE PRESS!!!

Tucson, Arizona - Today a major whitewash has been reported.
Rumors have it that it involved the whole state! Information
from a high source, revealed today that snow, yes snow has
been falling in the sunshine state. A witness claimed that
a funny, white substance resembling cotton, but much colder
has completely covered the ground. After a few inches had
gathered on the ground, it had strange effects on the
inhabitants. They started to pick up pieces of this
substance and throw it at each other!!! The national guard
has been called in and the president has declared Arizona
a disaster area.
    More information will be brought to you as we receive
it.

Why is it that REPLACE MODE is set up to prevent deletion
of lines of code? I realize that DELETE is designed for
that specific purpose, but when revising several lines of
code it is most annoying to have to revise one or two,
back out, move the lines forward to the proper line,
request deletion, and press next. Wouldn't it be far
simpler to just be able to delete via REPLACE by replacing
the unwanted code with nothing, then backing out? It is
particularly annoying when the offensive line is surrounded
by lines that need only slight alteration. At least it is
a pain to have to go back later and pick out the lines
one by one for deletion.

In fact, the way you suggest is the way it used to work.
It was later set up so that you couldn't accidentally
delete a line by merely pressing NEXT at the replace
arrow. Especially when keypresses are slow, it could
be disastrous to have a blank line delete what used
to be there: if you think the system hasn't gotten
your last NEXT keypress and you hit NEXT again, to
find that it was just sluggish; or if you were to
accidentally hit EDIT just before pressing NEXT..

It's really MUCH better this way.

(By the way, why not just replace those unwanted lines
with a * if it's so much trouble to go back and delete
them?)

R used to delete lines of code. It was changed because
the number of times that lines of code were lost due to the
accidently hitting of the -next- key. There was a general

There were 20 responses in favor of the non-deleteing of

        I agree that deletion from replace mode by
pressing NEXT is undesirable, but it would make more sence
to me to have HELP1 (pressed on an empty line from replace
mode) delete the line. This would be consistant
with the general use of HELP1 for deletions. It's being
a little lazy but a lot of things are done on the system

Besides, the first argument is full of holes anyway!
Under the old method, pressing NEXT "deleted" the line
in that the text was gone -- you still had to go back
and "D" those lines.

As Frye points out, R never allowed you to delete a line,
it only replaced it with a blank line. You can still do
that by typing one space then hitting NEXT. Or, if the
line is already a blank line and you want to go on to the
next line, hitting space or COPY or COPY1 then NEXT will
go on down.?
Unless the HELP1 suggestion is implemented, to really
delete a line (and not just blank it), let's PLEASE
leave it alone!

perhaps there is no error...but rather...when a FONT
(or other non-visible character) precedes or follows a
word, you get into a quandry...that word can "look" the
same to the human user yet be produced in many ways..e.g,
  FONTwordFONT
  FONT   wordFONT
  FONTword   FONT
  FONT word    FONT
  FONT FONT FONT word FONTFONTFONT....etc

the way the answer machinery is just starting to handle this
quagmire, is to eliminate the FONT before and after words
but not within words from the actual character string while
keeping a flag telling what FONT the word is in. The
problems due to the great freedom/quantity of character set
options is perhaps best illustrated by:
  answer FONTword1 word2 etc $$ the author's answer is
¬ in some language requiring an alternalte font

then, cont.next..

answer FONTword1 word2 etc...(answer in alternate font)

then the student puts in an answer of:

"FONTword2 word1..etc"

if the before-after FONT was attached to WORDS, then there
would be no way to judge a simple word mixup...for one
wouldn't be able to identify that "FONTword2" is really the
same word as the author's "word2"...
If you test the answer machinery, you will see that it
handles the matter successfully in a human sense.
Indeed, think of the possibilities with synonyms:
 answer (FONTword1a,word1b) word2 ..etc

in summary, this ain't an easy thing to understand, but,
FONTs "outside" of words gotta be handled in a peculiar way
else the human situation is not handled.

however, maybe on the next go around (don't hold your
breath)...the answer judging machinery should keep track of
any FONT changes within a word and then take a look at the
"ending" character and try to keep the font even within
a word...this would then handle your case by taking along
an ending FONT as part of the word ... that would probably
do the human thing since a FONT change within a word is
probably only doing some fancy accenting

Once-upon-a-time, there were instances where there really

has gotten more flexible, and especially as the -answer-

One of the major uses in the case of a single gigantic
writec having a bunch of BIGchars (as generated in lesson
-bigchar-), These characters are formed with a series of
supers and subs (or if only 2?2, they may be formed by
putting one line of chars under the other). By having
the altfont before the writec turn on font and turn it
off after, one may edit these chars in normal font, by-
passing the storage of quite a few shift-fonts to turn
on and off the access to the terminal's font memory.
(It also cuts down on having to re-edit those icky lines)

Along side of each course listed is a "broken" bar, such

completed o units in that week, a blank appears; if the
student completed 1 unit in that week, a thin vertical bar
(sort of like this "¬I") appears; if the student completed
2 units in that week, a slightly thicker bar appears; if
the student completed 3 units or more, an even thicker

Since the data for each course begins on a full-word
boundary, when I have to display the graph for one of the
courses, I just do a -showo- in altfont of the words
containing the unit completion data for the course,
A charset is loaded into the terminal such that altfont"o"
is blank, altfont"1" is the thin bar, altfont"2" is the
intermediate bar, and altfonts"3"-"7" contain the thickest
bar. This is a very fast and efficient way to plot this
graph. The only alternative would be to plot each line
as a -writec- in a -doto- loop, which would make the graph
take FOREVER to plot.
   Therefore, I beseech thee not to take away the -altfont-
feature. I would have to rewrite 4 or 5 very complicated
programs if this command was withdrawn, and it would down-
grade their speed of execution drastically.

I use -altfont- in two places: one where I could get
along without it, one where it's needed. The latter is
a -show- that must come out in altfont. The former is a
case where, for compact storage of long -write-s, the
terminal is loaded with a charset that has upper case
letters in the lower case slots. Thus, by putting the
terminal in altfont, I can use a -write- of lower case
letters and get upper case on the terminal, thus saving
the storage of a lot of 070 shift codes without the need
for a FONT at the beginning of every line.

   I have a code-generator which generates musical notes.
It makes it M_UCH?_ simpler to have a command reading
altfont on and then proceed with normal font outputting
(saves having to inject the font code all the time, as
I plot one character, and have to immediately change screen
coordinates). Also, for the person using the generator,
it makes it much more convenient if he can actually see
what keys are being used for the characters without having
to look at the charset all the time (since he's obviously
stuck with either copying my charset or using mine) (also
makes it easier to reorder the keys in his copy of the

Seriously: For one thing, I didn't know you could do
that (i.e. that a "fonted" write statement would also
"font" any embedded shows therein). Knowing that , I guess
I could live without the altfont command, but I still see
two problems with Paul Tenczar's suggestion: I thought
"embedded" shows used more CPU and required more "binary"
length than separate show commands; admittedly, it's a
rather small loss of efficiency, but some of us like to
save every TIP we can. Secondly, and more importantly,
there is a substantial loss of readability, as illustrated
above, which would result from such a solution. If you do
decide to withdraw the -altfont-command, would it be
possible to provide something like this:
write ¬0font¬1¬00,n1¬1 $$, which would condense into a "font"
code, but would plot normally in the editor?

   The main point was that altfont simply does not
function correctly in many cases and is rather difficult
and inconvenient to fix at the system level. The intro-
duction of the force font has provided another (much, much
more manageable way) to handle answers; there may remain
some inconvenience or real problem in doing various show
commands in other than the regular font--if so, precise
info on things that cannot be done in any other way or
suggestions of alternatives would be appreciated.
   As I indicated, some of us feel that this approach may
now have outlived its usefulness (in terms of the effort
required to fix it to handle special cases and problems
that keep coming up due to additions/improvements to the
system). No one has any intentions of making anything

  I think the crux of this controversy lies in the desire
to write nice, fast, readable code, no? Example: I have
a lesson which plots LARGE numbers of altfont characters
(yes, it's bigchar...). The -altfont- allows me to set
the terminal into altfont, plot all my chars, and take
it out again. This saves up to 1536 FONT's, w/ associated
memory-switching. My display would be CONSIDERABLY
slowed if -altfont- were taken away, asnd I'm sure there
are others who would suffer similarly, (17 secs. extra for

The random number generator uses the current value of

duplicate a sequence of -randu- random numbers...I don't
know the exact method of obtaining the number, though.

The seed, x(0), is set by the *clock* when the system

This method of generation has been tested and passes the

Something like this was reported in notes a while back. It
seemes that there is an elusive bug in the -show- command.
When you get the "****" result, the octal is still correct.
This also works with "D" from the author mode page where the
integer display sometimes becomes stars.

We hope to change the course records editor within a
few days to a new format. You can try it out now by
entering lesson "nrecords". Experiment by editing some
course you don't care much about, since there may be
some bugs yet.

Notes: don't exit from nrecords by shift-STOP, because
it doesn't handle that key quite the way it will when
nrecords becomes records. Also realize that you will
be able to enter by just typing the course name once
nrecords is the regular records editor, so the initial
page asking for a course would not normally be seen.

One of the very first things I noticed, Bruce, is that
"nrecords" has the same annoying tendency to bump you to
the "last edited by..." page at places one wouldn't expect
it to do so. My feeling is that one should _only_ see this
when first signing in to the records.

One possible bug--I tested, nrecords" on a course which was
not set up to receive pnotes. After selecting the option
of seeing pnotes records, I received the usual "This course
is not set up etc." message, but was then returned to
"records" (the old version) rather than "nrecords".

Several people have noticed that nrecords does not
permit changing user type once the record has been
created. This is to prevent certain kinds of security
problems that have been noted by many people. You will
also notice that you cannot change the spelling of an
author or instructor name, for related reasons.

One person suggested it would be less confusing for
novices if "student" were the default record type. You
will find using nrecords that you can specify all kinds
of options for authors and instructors. including specifying
that only students can be created.

A few comments:?
1) When entering security codes, both for the course
itself and for individuals, the code is asked for only
once. It should be requested twice to insure that it
is in fact typed in correctly, Transmission errors
could garble it, and not be detected; for the course
code, this would be especially bad news.?
2) When looking at an individual record, if SPECIAL
options are selected, and an individual special option
then chosen (such as examine variables), return from
examining variables is not to the page on which that
option was chosen, but one page further back.?
3) I don't think not being able to change a user type
is too bad, though I suspect there are some who really
want this ability.?

I really do object, though, not being able to change
the name on an author/instructor signon. I suppose this
was put in because of the receit exchange of notes on the
subject of pnote privacy; I still object. One does wish
from time to time to change a author's signon name without
losing all data about hours of system, etc.; witness last
year the time some system recomendations were made by the
User's Committee about selection of signon names, and some
people did in fact change their signons. Besides, this
doesn't provide pnote privacy. A course director could
still destroy the signon, create a new one, and access
the pnotes that way. What does this protect?

The pnotes problem will disappear when nrecords¬Drecords.

Yes, we should change the security code and password
type-ins to ask twice. Keep forgetting to do that.

There are some real problems getting rid of the "last

There are some subtle security problems associated with

  As Gary said, one can always copy a record to preserve

  Which makes the inability in change spellings silly,
unless the ability to copy author and instructor records
is also deleted.
  How does this do a better of protecting accounts,
pnotes, and anything else the signons security code matches?

  Also, when entering 'mrouhr' as the router in the course,
one is immediately jumped to be password page, with no
change to enter the name of instructor file.

Could the option for deletin; a student when inspecting

I must have missed something I did note see
a way to create a multiple record.....The only
options that I had were......student, author, instructor.

Also....in the past some people have lost track of
their passwords. Even though I could not determine
what it was, it was possible to clear out the password
and have the student pick a new one. The only way now
appears to be to create a new record and copy the contents
of the old one (minus password) so that you do not
lose the router info under the old signon.
I think that at least student and multiple passwords
should be clearable. We have also set up author
passwords (temp) at time of creation of the record....
might be a good idea to allow this.

the comment which carter finds undoubtedly wrong
(even though he admits not understanding it!) was
meant to suggest that the inquiry would be handled
differently if it were from a student writing a report
than if it cam from an agency which could publicize
or support CAI/CBE.
*
this is not to derogate the student's inquiry but
to point out that part of the purpose of assigning
reports is to teach the use of library resources. a
student inquiry should be initially referred to
literature while a foundation or governmental
institution request should be handled personally
by the system organization.
*
this was not to say student should not be helped--
quite the contrary-- but as priorities exist, the
depth and nature of the effort expended in response
to the inquiry would be differeny in the two cases.
i guess for some people you really have to spell it out!

Still wrong. It takes a lot of imagination to infer the
original request is anything related to an RFP (request for
proposal) or other official communication. The student
was correct in soliciting help through notes since much
of the CAI literature exists in obscure techinical reports
that even the U of I library has no knowledge of. The
recognition that a library search would yield an incomplete
picture of the field demonstrates a sophistication greater
than Dr. Hody's. In any scientific field, it is virtually
impossible to establish where the action is through the
published literature, due to the lag times for journal
publication. Informal access to the "invisible colleges",
which NOTES provides a means of doing, can precisely
establish current research interest. While I doubt rhet
105 will require this level of inquiry, this is a good
lesson to learn anytime.

There is another area a "computer instruction" which was

In CMI, the computer does little teaching, but rather
directs the path of the student through a prescribed

There are several substantive points at issue here that
certainly do not fall under the categorization "bullshit".
At issue is wheter the dissemination of current
(pre-journal) scientific research results should be
selective or open to all interested parties. Dr. Hody's
c-concern, as I understand it, was to establish whether the
inquiry was from student of someone "important". He
apparently favors the restriction of recent results--a
position I strongly oppose for at least two reason: (1)
Such a position restricts scientific advance. (2) People
connected with educational institutions are paid to assist
students.

(Reese ?) Mathews, I quite sympathtic towards your

note as it was labeled .CAI.! At this time I am in the
process of starting to get a bibliography of computer

this response I am waiting for some of it.
   What I am trying to say is that your request was/is
valid and the references people gave you should be looked
into, I will be most likely doing so.
   I came across one of the PLATO articles the other day
in_ SCIEN _ (date and volume, etc. available by pnote),
written, I believe, by D. Bitzer. This article
distinguished CAI and CBE nicely (I thought).

   Any reason for keeping the citation from the rest

in a file somewhere on the system).

   If I can add to the debate of whether the request
for info was made by a student or someone "important":
ever stop to think that the needs of these two types of
people are different? That is to say, a student in a 100
level course will probably be looking for different info
than someone doing a NSF research proposal. No?

that I am interested in the field myself and I thought that

   Sometimes there are things that have been missed or
maybe should be re-thought and a solution found--people
certainly have every right to mention and question such
things. Features and commands which have not been
announced have no guarantee as to their future existence
or continued operation in their current manner and so
are obviously not good candidates for inclusion in any
serious programming work. With so many commands and
options available, members of the system staff at times
give incorrect information or do not know about conditions
in a particular area (almost human, if you'd care to
look at it that way!)

with kludgy measures being taken to ignore the previous in-

It has been requested calmly since datafiles were first

However, since they won't even shorten "segment,vertical" I
would imagine that this will not be done either.

whereby sequential sections might be obtained from an
ecs buffer which was filled only occasionally from disk.
Note that the analog to this on the output side exists
in the form of data files.
   If it really is a random access situation, then I
think the user should be encouraged to analyze the problem
so as to minimize the number of disk accesses required.
This on contradistinction to encouraging the total
abandonment of such considerations to the "system"...and
then wondering why things are "slow" or"inefficient" in
operation.

1) -judge ignore- erases the r_esponse__, but does not
   erase the answer-contingent writing such as happens
   when you press NEXT or ERASE or EDIT after a "no"
   judgment. (This often seems unnatural and is
   hard to remember.)

2) _Something_ is getting erased...namely, the last
   too-large numer (5-9) which you type.

   You want the entire number to be erased. The
   -long 1- on the line just before the -judge ignore-
   is causing the judge-ignorer's response eraser
   to believe that there is only 1 character which
   needs erasing. (Try it with -long 1- *'ed out.)
I do not know to fix this, except by doing a
specific -at someplace-, -erase 2-.

        Why should the -judge ignore- eraser think there
is only one character at the arrow? We have tested, and
"jcount" is equal to 2 at that point. It would seem more
natural for the erasure to be contingent on teh vaule
of jcount, not whatever -long- happens to be in effect.
Also, no one seems to have understood the significance
of the line of asterisks written before the first judging
command. These were written to see where the erase was
being done, and the fact is that n_o _ erase is done. Also,
Mike (the _other_ one) forgot to mention that this code works
perfectly in TERM "stemp".

There is a special check for the very frequent (and
important) case of a "long 1 ; judge ignore". For this
case, it is desireable to remove the output for the
key from the output buffer, rather than adding more
output to erase it after it has gotten out. Of course,
if you have been auto-broken or are in step mode, the output
has already been done, and the output to do the erase
will be done. Since you are resetting long to 1, the
routine doesn't know you already entered something.
This special routine was once temporarily removed,
which had a disasterous affect on Plato's apparent
response time. The check can not be made on
jcount because with an input of 'T' (as on the author
mode page). jcount would be 2. Some fix here might
be possible, but it might be a while before it is done,
due to the complexity of the routine in question.

This would remain consistant with the format for deletion

with DATA to go between insert and replace mode, would
allow easy modification of a small piece of code.

(usually only one, but occasionally more than one) at
arrows. This has been happening tonight, even though
there is a relatively light load on the system (?¬n231

One user has asked that the "see who is running" choice

keypress to get thre shouldn't matter. And I don't
what to make the first-page menu any longer: I think it

The "escape" option? There is way out though. If

garbage it, you are sent to the "wrong security

get out.

In the way of "minor complaints" department, if you

upon pressing BACK, you are thrown to the "roster

Bruce, the reason I wanted "see students running" on the
first page was that it is not at all obvious that "running"
and the options it brings with it would fall under the
category of "roster operations". The 1st time I tried
nrecords I had to go through 3 of the 4 main options on the
first menu page to find "running". I don't think this was a
case of my own stupidity as I watched others have the same
problem. If you could somehow make a mention of "running"
in the parentheses after the option title on the main menu
page it would help.

  I still would prefer the students running option on
the first page. For taht matter...put the statistics
option in with 'special options'. It is by far the
slowest option in all of records. And not used much
in comparision with the 'students running' option.

  Other remaining bugs:
1) back from pnote file returns to regular course records
2) inactive p-notes option still shows in inspect only
3) data1 from main page doesnt work properly

  Other remaining request ;
1) bring back name and user type changes
2) allow inspection of author/instructor options in
     inspect only.
3) allow inspection of one's own author options..especially
     if in change mode.
4) allow inspection of signin messages in inspect mode

When a new course is added, the entries from course "Other"
are automatically copied in for the new course.

  03/07/76     20.36     halvorsen       pcp

I have several text editors that students use to enter
things like comments, opinions, etc that must be simple
to use. A very common format for this type of editor
is one that presses COPY1 at an arrow. This way, all
a user needs to do is press EDIT if he wants to change
any existing text and simply presses ERASE if he wants
to change the last few characters.

The only problem with this type of editor is that the
-press- command forces an implied pause. This causes
things to be very slow.

A suggested solution would be to add an extra parameter
to the -arrow- command such as:

arrow 1010,reedit

This would automatically take the contents of the copy
buffer and simulate pressing COPY1 at the arrow.

inputs. This must also be done with a -press-. I would

The only problem with eliminating the delay for the first
press is that I would like the user of an editor to be
able to page forward and backward through the lines of
text easily. This cannot be done by eliminating the delay
for the first press since if one wants to back up 5 lines,
he will get no delay for the first line and then get
delays for the next 4 lines. This would not an acceptable
solution to the problem. The only way to solve this would
be with some sort of parameter on the arrow macherinery.

When you suggest " simulating pressing COPY1" with the
reedit option, I assume that you do NOT want the -showa-
done, which would slow down motion to the next line. In
other words, it would be the responsibility of the author
to do the appropriate -showa- to get the text on the screen.

Wouldn't a -reedit- command be a better solution, with
the tag being the location of the character string? That
way the COPY key could also be active. The -reedit-
command would have to FOLLOW an -arrow- command (since
the -arrow- command initializes the input buffer).

What rice is doing is assuming that the pause before
the keypress would not show up since PLATO would be
executing the pause before the display actually reached
that point in the program (much as a pause now only is
fairly accurate if a catchup command precedes it).

This problem should be thought of as a regular state
function analogous to -loada-. ie:

arrow  100?line+101
long   120
entera string(line),len(line)
storea buffer,len(line)?jcount
*etc...

-entera- would make it look like the student had typed
in the answer in "string(line)" at the arrow (to the
judging machinery NOT the terminal), stop processing at the
-storea- and wait for some action by the student at the
arrow (EDIT, EDIT1, ERASE, ERASE1, etc.. etc..). When the
student takes action, normal output and processing resumes.
A line longer than -long- -entera-ed would cause an exec

It is not nearly that precise. Once started, the duration

AUTHOR REQUEST DEPARTMENT:

Could lesson " search" (X from the author mode page) be

following the "found, line are to be shown?

_sample_ use:
There are 6 occurences of 3 critical lines in 7 lessons, all
of which need to be checked for correctness. One would
normally block search for a keyword in the first line, in
each lesson, six times, and note whether the lines are
correct. If one could show several lines in lesson "search"
one could avoid the costly block-search, reduce the searches
needed in lesson "search", if used (1/3 as many), and save

On the contrary, the suggestion to use spaces is quite

instances of the word "use" (in light of recent changes,
perhaps the word "at" makes a better example of using this

Dave's comment on the lack of correlation between -tactive-
and the amount of idle time is good. -ptime- is a farce
for this purpose. One CAN do a loop and use -clock- to
find out which mode is better but that in its self takes
significant cpu (at least 4 full timeslices) to determine.
Accessing one variable is preferable to using 4 timeslices
to aquire the same (or worse) information.

As long as the system supplies a -backgnd- option it seems

Running jobs that do compiling is going to be a lot
stickier than Monte-Carlo or data retrievel-massage
jobs. The major factor in predicting the volatitlity of
background access is the number of people in background
and the "ducty-cycle" of their demands on cpu time. A
few game players will result in massive shifts in demand
in a matter of seconds. A class full of students using
lessons which require background will wipe out all chance
of background access (for themselves as well). The result
is that short of a rather involved combination of ESP and
considered, experienced judgement it is almost impossible
to come up with a single measure that will be valid for what
is desired under current methods of allocating resources.

Shifting into background status to test whether it is

is no background time available. I have had to wait

Because some importan discussions about Plato IV graphics
are imminent, I have opened lesson 'rotate' for running.
The lesson is not finished or proofed, but I decided
that now was the time to open it.

I have some general ideas that I believe are important to
the future Plato graphics. The lesson conveys some of these
ideas. Please take a look at it now with the thought
of looking at it again when it is finished.

The first complete craft of the lesson will be done by
tomorrow morning and the final form of the lesson will be
ready within a week.

Thank you.

3d graphics on PLATO would be a mixed blessing.

Admittedly the displays are pretty, but many of the
examples shown are too time consuming and may be good
art, but probably are not of much real use for all but
a small fraction of the PLATO applications.

Is it outside the range of propriety to ask what basis
there is for puting 3d graphics or music box control
in any language on the same footing as the basic semantic
items like branching, judging, units and basic output?

It could be argued that any command not really needed
by less than 10: of the user community be relegated to
the library of stuff in AIDS, and the work that currently
goes into adding such commands to TUTOR be devoted instead
to devising an efficient way to execute such things so
that execution is almost as good as if the command were
added to TUTOR. TUTOR is already too big.

I am afraid that the 10: criterion would wipe out most of
the language. Fewer than 30 commands get as much as 1; of
total usage. But note that this is the same thing that
occurs with natural languages. The idea behind a genuine
! language! is that people add vocabulary as they need it
rather than feel obligated to learn every word in the
dictionary. As to the second point, making operation of
current commands as efficient and effective as possible
has always had higher priority than adding new commands-
given that such added efficiency is of more benefit to
the bulk of users than the new command.

1) 3d graphics are inevitable someday. Now is the time
to talk about it so we won't run into trouble later.

2) My displays are not meant to be fast. They are to show
the ease with which rdrawn figures can be manipulated by the
addition of one or two commands. It would be up to the
lesson writers to find how to best use the graphics.

3) As for use by minorities, vocabs was created at the
request of a single lesson writer, but we would not have
the Aids facility we have without it.

4) Graphics is basicly semantic. Choosing the commands one
can manipulate rdrawn figures with is a semantic chocie. The
true purpose of graphics is communicational in nature.
There is basicly more intuative information in 3d figures
than there are in plane figures.

TUTOR is not too big. The prime advantage of a highly

large, comprehensive languages. TUTOR is a good start,

Comments on yet another idea(?):

In INSPECT only mode in a lesson, allow one to type:
J<unit name> next. This would stack the person's current
block/line numbers and do a U search for unit <unit name>,
unless it had been located before in which case its location
could be store) in a table. Then when one presses "R"
the stack is popped and one is Returned to the block/line
one J(oined?) that level from.

Is there enough room left in INSPECT only in the vars or
storage for this stuff? (even 2 levels would be GREAT!)

It would make tracing down code INCREDIBLY more efficient!

Think about it next time you look through a bunch of -do-s

The main reason this would be good on inspect only is
the availability of variables that are used only in
modification of code. The only problem is that perhaps
they don't know which vars those are..... in which case
they would need a J option to find out. So the lack
of a J option means that we won't be able to have one..

it sends you the lower 15 bits.
If you give it a floting number, first it rounds that to
an integer, and then sends you the lower 15 bits of that
integer.

I offer you the greatest of luck in finding anything rea-
scnable to perform this function -- one time, long ago, I
asked for this same function for -arrow- typeins in the
form of both a "dlong" ("display long", similar to -long-)
command and a *charcnt* (display character count) variable.
The system response at that time was "someday..." and this
request was made in early 1974!

If you're interested, I have 10-12 line calc that does
approximately the same thing -- or. if you have a blank
area on the screen, you can -showa- the string in mode
erase, then check "whrex, wherey, for the results -- re-

That -showa- suggestion would work, but only with a
-write ¬oa- ... since -write- correctly increments "where"
and -showa- doesn't.

Rut I do it with the check-each-char method:

Create a word "map" and a (two-variable) word "valu" and
-segment- them into single bits (mapbit ¬+ valubit?). Put
a huge, permanet number into "valu" such that valubit (x)
is 1 if character x prints. o if not. (Thus valubit (56)=0
since 56=070 (s Shift.) Then one quick loop:

doto    60max,N?1, ncchars $$nochars = ¬$ chars in input
calc    mapbit(N)?valubit(Nth char of input)
60max

Now, ¬$ of chars printed out of the first 60 input chars
will be simply bitcnt(map). However, this won't keep track
of backspace, super/sub, etc., which would require further
complications.

The notes editor uses a standard arrow; the contortions

judge it, and allow more keys if no match, are truly
horrendous. It is next to impossible (if not totally so)
to make the notes editor work like the TUTOR editor, which

For the sake of simplicity lets avoid any more system
terms. I know that term 'ecs' would be nice when you
are interested but I question whether it is really
necessary. After all, I as an author am not really
concerned what the current ECS usage is as much as I am
concerned about the general state of the memory i.e. full,
3/4 full etc. These things can be gleaned easily by noting
the time of day. If I am really interested in knowing
whether or not I have enough ecs to condense a particular
segment of code, is it really that hard to press 'E'
at the author mode page?

Could it be that your r/w memory (charset) card in the

   Thanks for the information/reminder--sorry this wasn't
fixed a long time ago. A special (incorrect) check was
being made for the 64th character and it was being skipped.
This check has been eliminated and everything now seems
to work correctly. The check has probably an artifact
of a different method used long go for the copying and
was intended to check for absolute character number 64
which is normally set to a space. (As it was, it actually
was checking for the 64th character in the set, not the
character associated with the character slot 64, so the
character lost depended upon the charset.)

A bug and some suggestions for gnotes:

But: When a gnotes file is completely reinitialized, with
     no archival copy and no notes kept in current file.
     the note index page lists the last note that was
     formerly in the file, with its old number, but will
     not (reasonably enought) let one access that note ¬$.
     This bogus listing disabears as soon as a new note
     is written into the file (as note ¬$0).

Suggestions (wild complaints) also have to do with the
reinitialization procedures, and are all related to the way
"deleted" notes are handled.

I realize that when a note is deleted, it is just various
pointers that are changed...no additional space becomes
available since the note is still there...it just can't be
seen (with some possible exceptions). This is quite a
reasonable way to handle things....BUT

  03/09/76     16.55     kimble       ustaf

While this is acceptable for the current notes file, does
it have to carry over into reinitialization operations?

1. Suppose I want to reinitialize a gnotes file. Fine.
   Let's say that there are notes up to ¬$163, and that
   there are several outdated notes, and several that I
   would like to retain. Let's also assume that some
   (perhaps 10 or 15) of the outdated notes are inter-
   sperced with the notes I'd like to keep around.

   It would be nice if I could just delete notes 132-148,
   say, and then specify that notes from 101 on (hopefully
   excluding notes 132-148) should be retained in the
   reinitialized file.

   Unfortunately, the dead wood (deleted notes) are also
   carried into the new file, taking up a significant bit
   of space, though they have been "deleted" and are not
   visible.

 ---------- response 3

Got your response in there before me...

Anyway, wouldn't it be possible for the reinitialization
routine to check the flags to see if a note has been
deleted before retaining it in the "new" file, and if so,
not keep it around taking up space?

2. The related question has to do with archival files...
I don't know how you handle that. but it would be nice if
it was not required that the chival file have the same
length as the current file. since there way well not be
as many notes in it, both due to deleted notes (as above)
and also since some notes may be retained in current file.

It would take too much time (like maybe half an hour for

S there a way to specify the number of digits to show

it writes the numbers right justified.

For example:

write Your score is -0s, sc(re,6.2-1

so that if score = 12.345 the the student will see
"Your score is 12.35".
However if I use showt, four extra spaces get stuck in

-showe- will let you specify exactly the number of

you want here, though. If you can't settle on a reasonable
compromise for the -showt- (like 3.2 in your case?), you
can calculate the number of places in front of the
decimal point to show (take the log of the number 10
be show, or whatever..) and do a-ot,score, (n1+0.2)¬1.

programming problem; _b_ for request for new feature;

Our experience with just two categories and the inability of

to expect that mode categories will mean more problems. You

I too agree with just one notesfile! I also find I dont
spend that much time reading notes. merely because I have
learned to look at the 1st few lines and decid how
interested I am in the subject.
One thing that would make life easier, and is planned,
is to store the last time you accessed Public Notes. Then
by pressing a key you could taken to the 1st note which
you havent yet read.
Something else that isn planned, but has been discussed, is
to use the above method to show you all notes that have new
responses since the last time you read notes.

  03/09/76     17.56     weible       german

I have constructed a random sentence generator in order
to test students on their recognition of syntactical
structures. Everything words just fine, except I can't
figure out an elegant and simple way of capitalizing the
first word in each sentence. What I need is a screen
display equivalent of the -put- command which would
cause the first letter of every sentence to be shifted.
I suppose something might be done using -pack- and -packc-,
but I hope someone out there can think of a tidier solution.
Unfortunately, trying to -white- shifted ? by itself,
doesn't work (shift? does slow up as a hidden shift,
but its effect doesn't carry over to the next -write-
statement). Ideas, anyone?

---------- response 1
  03/09/76     18.16     feugen       mfl

Perhaps I have overlooked something in the question,
(but how but this? ):
    -calc- a variable (let's say n1) to 'o70', load the
first word of the generated sentence into a buffer which
immediately follows the aurementioned variable, then
-write- ¬0a,n1,18¬1 (rest of the sentence).
    Such a structure will work relatively simply if the
first word of your sentence never exceeds 10 characters,
and only a bit harder if you could have more than 10.

   Look up the -move- command. The basic structure
in this case is to
move  thing,1,thing,2,length
move  'C',1,thing,1,1
where 'thing' is the think to be -showa-ed to 'length'.
      The first move shifts 'thing' over one character.
Since 'C' consists of SHIFT followed by 'c', the second
move will take only the shift code and glom it onto the
front of 'thing'.

   Capitalizing first charactor of student's response
is extremely easy to do, and have noticed that on my
own programs, and Clark's. Also, I don't think that
technique is what's needed here (I was wondering if you
might want to store all the sentences in a dataset, and
search for a period as a seperator between sentences. From
there, it would be easy enough to find out which char to
put an o70 in front of it and -move- the rest of the
junk (also easy to find out charector length of sentence
for the -move- tag)).

Mcneil's note is the right one... I would have responded
but your thing about "elegance" made me reconsider.
-packc-s and moves are not exactly elegant. Here is some
code that might work.

unit   packsent
calc   string?o7000 0001 0000 0000 0000
       char?2 $$ char position to -move- to
doto   1,word?1,numword
do     packc $$ all the .writec-s converted to -packc-s
*packc returns word in pbuff and length in length
move   pbuff,1,string,char, length
calc   char?char+length
1
at     wherever
showa  string.char

Its kinda schematic but it would work.

i have a datafile with the same -outputl- repeated over

the -outputl- is done in the router upon return from a
lesson. a second -outputl- is done at the same time; but
this outputl turned up only once. in other words, it looks
like one of the -outputl-s got into a loop -- there's
nothing in the lesson to cause this.

the teacher reports that the student got an execution error

I've spent about an hour looking at your datafile and
router, and am not convinced that your lesson couldn't
have put out all those outputls.

1) after entry return1 you appear to output a trace
   outputl without outputing anything else, so if
   the student ever gets back to return1 without
   outputing anything else, he can loop and fill the
   datafile.
2) from unit return1 the student can apparently be
   jumped out to a lesson whose name you compute.
   I assume the lesson he goes to might return him
   to entry return1.
3) the outputls were done over about a 5 minute period,
   allowing guite a bit of processing before coming
   back to return1.

I've spend about a half acur looking at the execution
routines for outputl, and im not convinced that they
don't loop either.

No, what that is (believe if or not) is the "day" that
your lesson data page was last edited. To make a long

lesson name was, for a couple of weeks, used to record
the day on which the lesson data page was changed. Since
then, the day info has been voved, but the garbage was
left, so the new charset/micro stuff picks it up. Just
clear it out, and ... I am, naturally, sorry for the

Data comes to the terminal every 1/60 second REGULARLY;
a specific display (including -delay-s, which are actually
output to the terminal)will take the exact same time
if:
   1) you're not autobroken
   2) you receive no -talk- or other messages

Again, you cannot time ps__r__o__c__e__s__s__i__n_g this way! Even with

From your note, I draw the conclusion that you are

little write of space in the lower right hand corner

---------- response 6
  03/11/76     10.48     perry       uw

From golden:

It is not nearly that precise. Once started, the duration
of a -delay- should be correct to the nearest 1/60 of a
second. But the exact starting time is unknown, and, if
line errors occur during a delay, the timing can be thrown
off by almost a second.
******

  The key words are !once started." In your case you
sent something to the terminal, which "started" and output
string. Before the string was finished being sent to
the terminal, your program called for the delay, which was
then tacked on to the string. And before the delay was
finished, your program tacked on the second string. Thus
you have a very precise timing (provided you never get
autobroken, etc. during this process).

  We have been using such a device to present and then x-out
words in a vocabulary test. Line errors seem to be the only
bug.

Issues don't stay in general notes too long since so
many notes push everything older than 2 days off the

something again.

From the past discussion, it seems that a -reedit-
command would be the best solution for everyone who
has the same problem about text editors and re-editing.
This would just have the effect of simply setting up
the arrow machinery so that it would seem as though
the student has already entered the text specified
by the -reedit- command. This would greatly simplify
the problem of writing simple text editors that don't

Very good. One other suggestion:?
It seems the HELP is given using a -helpop-. Why not put a

it doesn't take up all that the erasing the help as soon
as you use it? That way, the help stays one the screen as
long as you want to use the feature. (Of course, this
makes it desirable to continue to replot the page when done,
or at least to erase all that stuff.)

   Some replies:
(1) Yes, probably both the block delete and block recover
  options should have a simpler original message and a more
  detailed explanation--maybe another day (month, year?)
(2) The replot of the block display is sort of related to
  the fact that the "parts" option is in a different lesson
  from the main one and the simplest, cleanest, and easiest
  type of connection is just to return to the point of
  replotting that main block display. This might be
  worked on some day.
(3) Using the number keys to select another part while
   remaining in the parts option would be nice (but again
   poses some problems since the basic block display
   generator is in another lesson).

Since people have been suggesting commands lately, I will
toss in my own suggestion.

I suggest a change in the structure of logical operations
such that a line of code such as

could be written in a  more condensed form such as

        (x=1:s:8)

This form is still readable and is unlikely to be confused.

specifying a vertical segment?

---------- response 1

        The idea is interesting, but it probably wouldn't
save any condensed lessons space. I also think the current
syntax is more clearly readable. However, I _would_ like 
to see the ability to use "¬+" (ACCESS-+) and "¬I" (ACCESS-I)
as logical operators implemented. It has also been
suggested that "?=" and "??" (the shifted = and ?, respective-
ly) should be able to serve as the logical intersection

would be available for those who prefer them to the less
compact $operator$ format. There is precedent for this, in
that the "*" is valid for multiplication and "c" for comment

  It has always been intended eventually to add logical
and bit union and intersection operators as ALTERNATIVES
(not replacements) for $operators$. It is such a low
priority item that more important jobs have continually
muscled their way in front.

 Also, sometime in the future, something may be done
to shorten the define segment and array specifications.

Probably this won't happen until they are improved in some
significant (and for now unspecified) way, so don't hold

Also an argument can be made against the ¬I symbol being
used in anything BUT pl/1 since that is the only place it
is used in technology to represent a logical operation.
Its evolution could be considered much akin to that of

Keep in mind that the system will not "publish" anything

only way to go if you want it listed in the upcoming system
catalog.

The present plan calls for leslists to be the vehicle which
connects the system catalog with routers--your router, my
router, any system routers. There needs to be some such
standard place and standard format for file information.
And it won't cost more in a leslist than in common if they
are variable length.

PLATO has been used by several television stations in
past elections and will be used by at least two next week.

PLATO stores incoming results, past results, and provides
displays. In the past the displays were taken directly off
the plasma panel. WCIA will try feeding their own video
character generator from PLATO this year.
If PLATO goes down, central Illinois won't get timely
results since both CBS and NBC affiliates are depending on
us.

In my own very biased opinion, the 1972 results displayed
via PLATO were more often synchronized with the live
announcer's voice than were the displays from the national
network.

        Well, if no one else is going to say anything...

        There is a big difference between SETTING a base
pointer with -base <unitname>- and CLEARING the base
pointer with -base-.
        Putting -base -at the beginning of each unit
(or in an -imain- unit) will NOT set each unit as a base
unit, but will clear the base pointer so that no unit will
be a base unit. But setting -base- to the current mainu
will set the current main unit as a sort of a help sequence
unto itself. I.e., BACK will replot the unit! (This is
actually useful when using -inhibit erase-d -jump-s, so
that NEXT will not replot the screen, but BACK will--it
ends the help sequence!)
        Incidentally, to set each unit as a base unit,
there seems to be no way around including a -base- com-
mand in each and every unit. (cont'o.)

  03/12/76     09.35     jmk       pso

In a main unit, if the base pointer is NOT set, then that
unit IS a base unit. If the base pointer is non-zero, it
contains the name of the base unit. The base unit is
where you go if you press -back- (if you haven't set the
BACK pointer with a -back- command) or shift -back-.
If you don't go anywhere when you press one of those keys.
then you are in a base unit.
Putting a -base- command with no tag makes it a base unit.
Thus the first response to this note (imain unit with a
base (blank) command) was correct.

We all seem to agree on the ideas, but not the semantics.
The important difference between test1 and test2 is in the
behavior of test1a and test2a. By naming "test2" in the tag
of the base, we _cause_ test2 to be the first unit of a "help"
sequence, so that a BACK keypress in test2a will return
to test2. A BACK keypress in test1a will not return to
test1.

        I think you have the adresses wrong way about.
The first argument of the comload is the CM address _to_
which you want the common loaded. The second argument
is the ECS address _from_ which you want the common loaded.
Unlike -block- and -transfer-, which have "from, to" syntax,
-comload- has a "to, from" syntax.

We had a strange problem here this afternoon, involving
an instructor signon, and in ECS shortage.. Rita signed
into her course with an instructor signon at terminal
22-11... She worked for a while, and our ECS allotment
dropped to its base.. As she attempted to transfer
from one section to another, she got an ECS allotment
message, and was bounced out of the course. Being
bounced out that drastically did NOT de-assign the course
from her signon.. As a result, I tried to edit the
course a while later and got the message that someone
at 22-11 was editing the course and that i could only
get inspect only... There was no one at 22-11, and
I was mystified for a while, but managed to figure out
what had happened.. I signed on to the terminal
with that same instructors signon, signed out, and
everything was fine once more,?

---------- response 1
  03/12/76     16.29     meers       wright

    The cause of this problem seems to be with the way
that instructor signons are charged for ECS. Once an
author gets on, he may edit courses, write notes, edit
lessons, and condense lessons of 1500 words and less..
    Instructors do not get these same courtesies.
Lesson 'imode' is charged at 1500 words.. If an
instructor ALSO tries to get into her course, or
read/write a personal note, she is charged an additional
1500 words. As a result, instructors can oftentimes
get on, but if ECS is tight, cannot do anything that
requires more than the 1500 words.
    I would like to suggest that this be handled in
the same manner as authors, where 1500 words is THE charge
for anything less than c indensing a lesson.

when using 'nookno' the 'no' is erased after a no
judgement even though it has not been written there.
this destroys any screen display which appears there.

it should be changed at the systems level.

There seem to be a number of these erase problems related
to the arrow command. Ever try putting an arrow in the
lower left-hand corner of the screen? It won't get erased
as most arrows...there a also quite a few other problems
related to the specs noo o...is there any chance that
these problems will be of some system programmer's
schedule?

(1) ALL problems are on some system programmer's list
  to be fixed some day. Some of the less critical ones
  may not be fixed for many months because of more pressing
  work. It is of course conceivable that some things could
  get lost in the shuffle over time occasionally.
(2) There are NO known problems with the specs nookno that
  have not been fixed. the problem "described" here
  actually involves the following elements:
  (a) specs nookno
  (b) sized writing
  (c) the pressing of the SHIFT-ERASE key (or NEXT in
   the case of a wrong answer)
   See a note of 2/24/76 where this problem was mentioned
and the note of 2/26/76 where its correction is noted.
However, it is unfortunately the case that as of this
moment, that correction has not yet made its way to
the prime time version--but we expect to update i in
the next day or two.

  03/12/76     16.56     ahasio       med

"It would be nice if" you could ignore specific words in a
concept. Presently vocabs allows you to forever ignore words
or forever consider them important. I often find that words
which are important in one answer are ignorable in another.

A simplified example would be an answer in which concept "C"
is the correct answer but including "a" and/or "b" would
also be correct though more specific than required. This
answer must be specified as:

concept c
        a c
        b c
        a b c

This would be better (especially when 3 or more concepts
were ignorable):

concept c <a,b>

I think that this has been requested before; I believe
Paul Tenczar said that it was useful enough to implement,
but that he would have to re-implement the entire concept
machinery, which would take perhaps a year or more.

---------- note 318 endings
  03/12/76     17.15     ahasic       med

   "It would be nice" if endings could contain something
similar to a phrase, For example:

endings 0,ate,ic,ic,*acid would allow
 
vocabs  acet//0 rather than

vccabs  (acetate,acetic,acetic*acid as it now stands.

In the case of phosphoenolpyruvate its utility becomes more
than obvious.

This problem and the previous one about concepts have bugged
me before, However I never bothered to write a note since I
knew that there was no chance of of anything being done before
the lesson which needed them was completed, But these prob-
lems have come back to haunt me once too often. Perhaps now
my children will never have to face these trials.

just to say that I read these suggesions and will keep
them in mind.

some perhaps random thoughts follow:
while it might seem to some that the concept, endings and
phrase algorithms are trivial...they sure haven't been
trivial for me to implement. they have slowlyl evloved
in a cyclical nature: from a simple state to a more complex
state..that when operational becomes obvious and thus
simple again...and once simple allows for further
complications to be implehented, etc.
so, as soon as I catch a breath and see that the current
state of these features are simple, I can procede on another
cycle...

---------- note 322 funnkeyu
  03/12/76     20.34     nike b       cornell

      Suggestion for a new command:

      Currently there is a weakness in the TUTOR language
that is most easily seen in this example. Suppose you
have a lesson with a large number of student-initiated
branches available, and suppose that you have an -imain-
unit which advertises something at the bottom of the screen.
Currently, I do not believe there is any really workable
way to turn of the -imain- for selected branches, but
leave it active for others. Similarly, there may be
certain initializations you want to perform in certain
branches ut not others. What is needed is aunit which
is executed _before_ the new main unit. but after the func-
tion key press. This is logicall very different from the
action of the -imain- unit.

    [Continued in first response]

---------- response 1
  03/12/76     20.43     nike b       cornell

         I suggest the -funkeyu- command with the following
syntax (suggested by michael/cornell):

        funkeyu unit, next,next1; unit2,help,back1;etc.]

with the conditional form:

        funkeyu expression, (unit1,next,next1;unit2,back1,
                help),(unit1,stop,data,help;unit2,data1.
                help1),[etc.]

        I would welcome a less complicated suggestion for
the syntax of the conditional form.

     Could we have a system response to this idea?

  03/12/76     21.08     warner       iu

         In my lesson 'energy4' there is an example of the
use of an imain unit that tests for the value of "key"
when it is branched into. If key=next it does different
code than if key=back.
         This code has problems, however. In certain cases
the student must return from a help sequence with the
effect of a -back- press. If the student presses -NEXT-
at an -end help- wrong branches might be taken. This means
that I must use the following kludgey code:
pause   keys=next,back
press   back
end     help
        Perhaps what is needed is some easy way to test
if a student is in a help nit, or perhaps an -ibase-
unit done whenever one enters a new base unit.

  03/15/76     00.20     k mast       p

Would Warner's solution solve your problem? I much prefer it
to your proposed format!

I'm not sure what to do to solve your problem, Silas.
Perhaps you could look into trying to use the system defined
word 'ahelpn' or 'ahelp' (I dont remember which one it is)
to keep track of when a guy got help.

---------- response 4
  03/15/76     09.13     mike b       cornell
   
        I certainly could write could of that sort (this
solution occurred to me), but as warner admits, it is
kludgey. The -funkeyu- command would solve this problem
gracefully and be a logical addition to TUTOR, which has
developed a rather sophisticated ability to catch and
act upon the student's every keypress.

        If you mean his -1base- command, yes that would
solve my currnet difficulties, and I'm sure it would be
much easier to implement. It is not as flexible as my
suggestion, but I would consider it sufficient.

Sorry about the condense error in "topics". The error has

 I get a condense error (understandably) when
 I try to put the -vocabs- block AFTER the arrow that
used it; but when I have an -endings-, I also need to
put that before my -vocabs- block!
*
       Thus, for one arrow. I have used 3 blocks.
is there any way to avodi this hassle?
(also, who wrote the -vccabs- block editor? I think it
could use some improvements badly, although the basic
workings of it I won't fault.)
	 Also. are there any lessons written on the
useage of -vocabs- ?

Ther's no way to get around this restriction now.
Eventually, though, you will be able to reference a vocabs
block in the same sort of way as a common block, so it
won't matter here the block is located in the lesson.
In fact, it could even be in a different lesson.

In its current form it seem; only marginally useful. I
realize that, with the adven of referncable blocks (as

to use the -vocabs- block. Are there any plans for

for those interested in the problem stated in note 270,
my errors revolved around two points:?
        1. my defines were not addressing the same
           "location" in both CM and ECS common;?
        2. more critical, an "offset" had to be -calc-ed
           when transfering the second part of my ECS
           common into CM, which was necessary, i guess,

    How about using the neat new -getword- command?
Or since you are not in judge state, why not try a
-find-, or a -findall-? You can do many searches,
if all you want to find is the occurence of something,
rather than a non-occurance.

The trouble is that, according to aids, -getword- requires
that one predict where, in the response, the correct word
is located; -find- may be a better choice, but I haven't
quite been able to figure out how to apply it.
Also, I'm curious to know, why do you consider the second

        Why don't you use the numerical -concept- options?
Set up a vocabs with "real" and "virtual" attached to the
same concept but given two numbers. Then you can do a

One "group" that might benefit from having it's own
groupnotes file is beginning authors.

For them, many public notes contain information that they
don't yet understand and don't want to wade through.

Many new authors may not write a question in public notes
because they know that the greater part of the public
already knows the answer.

A "beginners" notesfile (that authors could both read
and write) could be a place where new authors write their
questions and where they can read other new authors'
questions and responses. PSO people could maintain this
file, write notes of special interest to new authors, and
also transfer from Public Notes any notes that would be
of interest to new authors.

Good idea" I was just about to suggest the same thing

       Excellent!

       I'd much rather know where I can find the 'help'
notes, than have to sift through all the public notes
to see if they are a new author's request for aid.

       Although I like the new notes features, I would
like to see 'help' notes the way they were. (My only
hesitation, however, is that possibly urgent requests
for aid will go unanswered by the authors who have
the necessary experience. Perhaps 'psonotes' could
be used for this, then?)

  The idea is a good one. Even if you are not a new
author, there are still many things that some people
take foregranted that we still don't know, most likely
because we have never had need for them, My questions
are usually answered either by other authors, consultants,
or even AIDS, but a notefile of this type would be a
lot of help to new people. I learned a lot about TUTOR
from the old HELP NOTES, and even though I may not need
much of what I read in PUBLIC NOTES, I can now understand
most of it. I also agree on getting new authors into
the habbit of reading the notefiles every day, otherwise
they get bogged down in just their own areas.

Prior to last fall I had never _seen_ a large computer much
less tried to write a program for one so that probably
qualifies me as a new author; virtually everything I've
learned about tutor I've gotten from Sherwood's book or
have picked up in bits and pieces from other authors.
I think the beginner notefile is much needed and would be
deeply appreciated by new authors. Not only would it spare
the necessity of coming into public notes as the villiage
idiot, it would probably increase the chances of the
response to a question being comprehensible.
As was mentioned in one of the earlier responses, much of
public notes is meaningless to the new author.

I am mildly opposed because I would expect the proposed
notes file to evolve along one of two routes:
1)  It would become just what help notes was with users
rather unclear about what should go into which file;
or
2)  It would be a separate notes file and some authors
would never feel right about moving to Public Notes;
therefore, questions of greater and greater complexity
would begin to appear.

In either case, authors and CERL staff would still be
forced to read all notes to be well informed.

It seems better to me to work to overcome the reluctance
of new authors to use Public Notes. When it comes to using
an interactive computer system for instruction, everyone is
a beginner! We shall continue to learn from. each other for
a long time. I favor the unified Public Notes.

I tend to disagree, Bill. New authors, especially very new
authors, tend to have a large number of quite simple prob-
lems related solely to their lack of familiatity with PLATO
conventions. "My lesson says INSPECT ONLY. Why won't it
let me edit?! "I accidentally deleted a block. HELP!!!!
I doubt most experienced authors benefit by wading through
these types of notes; mode importantly, I think new authors
are afraid to bring up such problems in PUBLIC NOTES, and I
can't see how this situation will improve.

Personally, I think the major problem with old HELP NOTES
was that it was never defined exactly what should be in it,
despite the HELP page description. A G-NOTE "novicenote"
with a descriptive title like "Novice Programmer Notes"
could potentially improve things.

Believe it or not, I once went into the old HELP notes to
ask what the purpose of the "S" (security code) option was

option since one can change their password on the password
entry page---and whether you call it a "password" or a

It only takes one snide response to a dumb question to
inhibit the askee from asking any more questions for
quite some time.

I think the notefile for beginning authors is a great idea,
and it seems more in the Plato trandition to try it out for
a while than to think up resons why it won't work. Us
folks trying to convince skeptics that programmed
instruction is a worthwhile thing have already heard
more than enough reasons why something won't work.

Furthermode, I don't think tht people had all that much
trouble differenriating help notes from general notes in
the old style files. 95; if the notes were categorized
reasonably, and 5: disageement in qualitative analysis
is actually a respectable figure. When you are dealing
with humans instead of machines you got to make some
allowances.

When this happened to me, Larry White explained it this

That message means that Plato was unable to find a
contiguous area of disk space large enough to hold
your longer file. I would like to encourage those
account directors that are creating empty files, in
order to have space later when they need it, to
delete all those files. The ability to create and
destroy disk files was given to account directors
to make it easier for them to do their work, not for
them to hurt the Plato system by creating extra files.

Work is in progress on the system level to lessen this
problem, but till then wanted to create as few files
as we want other account directors to create.

password option allows one letters and numbers, not

I am usually a soft spoken person, but when I discover that

How much nicer it would have been, if authors could have
been informed of this feature, instead of accidentally (or,
deliberately) stumbling upon it, or hearing of it by word of

that -branch- is a -calc- type command and the lable is

        The -pack- command is the exception to the rule
just about everywhere else....in -search-,-compute-,

        Someday the -pack- command's variables will
be reversed, and a system conversion run.

I think the -pack- was originally made reversed, because
of the (expected) tendency of people to say

pack n1,n2 $$ putting the variables in numerical order

If you had
pack string,length
then for strings of more than one word, the length (n2)
would overwrite the string (n1).

It _is_ confusing to have it backwards from everything else,
and besides, most people define their variables, so that
one doesn't see the n1,n2 anyhow. So someday perhaps
we will change,

By the way.... don't try to remember all these order
conventions. It is practically painless to look them up,
and who can remember 200-odd tag formats??

---------- response 2
  03/15/76     22.05     judy       pso
1) you are allowed to keep more than one pointer, so you can
   switch from one -compute- to another without constantly
   resetting the pointers.

2) I do not know how often the -compute- buffer fills up.

   The string which is stored in "pointer" -- and which
   has absolutely no meaning for you or for me -- contains
   information about where in mermory the compiled code is
   kept and some "checking" bits which must match up with
   a portion of the compiled code: itself. Therefore if the
   compiled code is over-written, the -compute- will
   automatically recompile itself, even though "pointer"
   was not zeroed by the program.

---------- response 3

It is sufficiently difficult to explain the need for and
the use of the pointer for repented executions. Requiring
the pointer puts a tiny extra birden on those people who
really don't intend to re-execite the code, but keeps
things crystal clear for those who might. It seems to me
that if the 4th argument were optional many people would
not use it when they really did need it. The present
format is designed to be educational, in that it forces a
certain amount of attention to be paid to how the thing
actually works.

In other words, it takes a certain amount of sophistication
to use a -compute-, and even more to distinguish those
cases where the pointer is superfluous.

    A slight change has been make in the handling of
a helpop after a judge ignore. It has been the case that
althought the last writing on the screen is NOT erased when
a judge ignore is done, that writing IS erased when a
helpop branch is then taken. This has been changed so
that the helpop branch no long causes this erase to
occur. This seems more logical (in some sense), since
after the execution of a judge ignore, entry of answer
is begun afresh and so there should be no writing on the
screen to be associated with the currnet answer. If this
will cause anyone problems, please let us know. We can
change this back if there is something that has been missed
--but the new way seems more convenient for many uses.
   A related issue is whether or not the judge ignore
actually should erase the last answer-related writing.

There seems to be a lot of interest in reviving some sort of
distinction between requests for help and "other" notes.
Would something like the following be workable (and useful)?
After writing a note for the public notes file and entering
a keyword, the writer is asked:
Is this a request for help?
The writer then responds with ..y" or "n"; if the response is
"y" then an -D or * is displayed next to the keyword on the
note selection page.
At least this way one could spot the "help" notes before

       This is an idea, but I believe that most of
the objections that have come from "older" authors
were that they had to sift through all the notes
as they were going through them, to determine
whether or not the note was a request for help.
       To have this flag as you suggest, the author
would either have to "remember" the number of the
note which was undesireable to him, or he would have
to look for it (if put there) inside the body of
the note itself; but then he has already been
forced to read the note somewhat, because he is
still looking for this flag. (another bit to set)
       I believe that things can safely enough be
left the way they are.

then the writer of a note can signal to the rest of the

start a convention of preceeding all the help-type

You can photograph the screen with a TV camera, then
show the image on a television screen. Use a zoom lens
to enable the magnification. you need a fast lens (f2 or
better). Since most cameras are not very sensitive in
the red, you will probably want to amplify the signal
coming out of the camera, then use the contrast control
on the monitor to make a high-contrast display. The
resolution is not high enough to see the whole plasma
panel display well. but with the zoom you can look at
sections of the panel.

Of course you can also use projection video to put the
image on a large screen.

If you are going to go to the bother of a special text

Thanks to all for the suggestions.

The trouble with beepers is that you have to know
morse.	TV is a possibility, but the set up of terminals
here would make this technique difficult in practice.

We are investigating the possibility of an editor
which uses sized writing. There are obvious difficulties
with this solution. however (betting condensable code is
awkward, for one thing; the EDIT key won't work for
another).

The best solution would still seem to be a magni-

the image would be real). I suppose the plasma panel may
not be bright enough for this to be practical, however.

No. PLATO terminals are located at the three stations using

At the moment, you must press shift-BACK or shift-STOP
to exit from editing a course. I put in BACK1 with the
idea that there are so many menus in the course editor
that you might like to be able to hit BACK without going
all the way out. But maybe it would be nicer to have
a simple BACK to get out from the main index page. What
do you think?

On a related topic, I think it is true at the moment that
shift-STOP doesn't necessarily take you all the way out,
but rather takes you only part-way out from some parts
of the course editor. I will try to locate these spots
and fix them up.

It used to be the case that if the defined name for a
variable was 7 characters long. that variable could be
referenced by any(?) length string that began with those
7 characters. This now produces condense errors.

I assume the reason this change was not announced is
because the feature was not announced, but I thought it
was so maybe someone else did too.

Those condense errors can go unnoticed if the lesson is
not usually condensed by authors and if they don't cause
execution errors.

The condense errors are just warning, to tell the author

666 of them...cos(cos(1)) 499...
Regarding this. is there one big buffer that everyone
uses, or is there an individual one for each lesson or for
each user...does it depend on how much space the lesson
takes up? etc...

  This is just a guess...but I suspect the passwords are
zero-filled or something...meaning that there is no
typable password that will match it..hence the only access
is via the system signons witch bypass all passwords
anyway. Am I right systems?

When using your own accents in association with a font
character set, you create the design in access-a through
access-j. Then, to get these accents to behave like
"accents" you refer to access-1, access-2, etc.

Yesterday I noticed in edit mode, that typing
"FONT, letter, access-1" gives me the number 1 as an
accent instead of the accent which is associated with "1".
If I then erase this strange-looking stuff, the correct
accent comes in my font typing.

The basic problem with the printing routine is that it is
separated from the rest of the system. When changes are made
to either plato or the condenser, they are often not made
in the printer.
I've heard talk recently that the printer could get
information from the condenser. Hence, whenever changes
are made to the basic operating system, they are reflected
in the printouts automatically.
I know that doesnt help you with your problem immediately,
but there IS hope for the future!

A new edition of the major reference to CBE materials is

an edition that included only PLATO III material (and was
probably equally dated for other materials). At that time
we had some 13: of all CBE materials in the world and were
the leaders in quantity (by contact hours) by a small
margin. A half dozen or so centers accounted for a massive
portion of all materials at that time (and probably still
do). The matter of contact hours is also moot. Some other
people (i.e. Hewlett-Packard) have thousands of terminals
out that can do CAI (but no data on IF they do much). The
safest thing to do is to simply cite our data and let them
draw their own conclusions. Al Avner

   Has anyone gotten any flak about students losing
asterisks on their lessons (mrouter) ?
        About half a dozen people here have complained
about this, but I have no idea or way of checking
whether they ever got credit in the first place or not.

        I hate to come right out and say it, but is there
a possibility that something isn't working quite right
in mrouter (a variable getting used twice or what not)
and that students do recieve credit, but somewhere
later along the way, the variable gets zeroed?

---------- response 1

Sometimes students get confused between credit ( * ) for
a lesson and finishing part of a lesson which has an
index. An index of lessons in mrouter can look similar
to the index to parts of a lesson. In every case I have
seen where a student says that the credit for finishing
a lesson has been lost, it has turned out to be credit
for completing part of a lesson which has been lost because
of electing to restart at the begining of the lesson or
going into some other lesson and comming back. However
this does not eliminate the possibility that there is a
problem with mrouter.

   I have heard of students complaining about this
occasionally, too. Sometimes the problem is the
result of a lesson not having an !end lesson! or
"lesson completed" in the final frame seen by the
student. What happens is the student might press
-shift/stop- instead of next. This problem would
not occur if a "lesson completed" were used instead
of or with the "end lesson." (NOTE: if the "lesson
completed" is in the last unit of the last block, you
do not need the "end lesson.").
   Another problem causing this is lessons which
allow the student to "jumpout" to other lessons
before the student gets credit for completing the lesson.
   I am guilty of having 2 lessons which are introduction
that allow students to choose any lesson in a series.
This is good if the jumpout lesson is the only one
the instructor wants on an index, but bad if the

Lesson completion information will be lost if you
reinitialize your instructor file (or copy another
instructor file, or attach a different instructor file.)
And, of course, no lesson completion information is kept
for students using multiple signons.

If you have an example of a student record for which the
lesson completion information is definitely in error, I
would appreciate details.

Several years ago, at the beginning of the present -calc-
machinery, I had intended that ¬< and ¬> should make the
same fancy equality check that = and ¬= make. (For those
of you not familiar with this special equality check,
"a=b, is true in TUTOR even if "a" and "b" differ by a
tiny amount. This compensates for the fact that the
computer does not have infinitely fine gradations in
floating-point numbers, but only about 15 significant
figures.) Apparently I goofed, and only within the
last year did I find to my surprise that ¬< and ¬> do NOT
make this check, which seems unfortunate and inconsistent.
Yet some lesson somewhere may behave differently if we
make a change. Nevertheless, I propose "fixing" this.

Yes, indeed: I had no idea that ¬< and ¬> had different

I have tried once or twice to use ¬</¬> in situations where
large numbers have to be divided, and wound up using a
made-up version of ¬= and = instead. Certainly the checking
should be the same.

I've appreciated the efficiency of < and > as they are,

It seems logical that ¬< should mean "less than" or
"equal to" in the same terms that the language defines
these components; to get this meaning now, one must
write x<y$or$x=y or something equally ugly.

I'd like to see this changed. Perhaps an optional

But if ¬< DOES do a fancy equality check, then it is
possible for a¬<b AND simultaneously for a>b, so that the
logically disjoint ranges overlap!

Suppose that, due to round-off errors, a is just barely
larger than b, with their difference being within the
tolerance of the equality checker. Then a¬<b is TRUE,
and a>b is also TRUE.

This is an argument AGAINST making a change to the present
scheme. More discussion?

Whether I use n-variables or not, depends on what I'm
doing" A blanket statement either way will obviously
have exceptions.?
I see the need for efficiency; but if people can get
confused now, just try handling the explanations why
someone's bug is due to the fact (if it becomes true)
that "a<b" and "not(a¬>b)" can be different" And if
the "almost equal" case is important for ¬< and ¬>,
then why isn't it important for < and >??
Seems to me whatS needed is some way to say "almost".?
"not(a¬>b)" retain the same truth values for ALL values
of a and b. Otherwise, I see chaos!

Maybe the thing to do is to make the checking for
"almost" the normal way (with v-variables, of course),
for all the operators = ¬= < > ¬>, and have a way to
turn off the tolerance checker...an -inhibit-, maybe...
for those worried about efficiency, or who need a test
for "actual" value instead of "almost".

Logically equivalent tests using any of <,>,¬<,¬>,=, or ¬=
should all agree, Equality should be said to exist over
some proportionally small range as is done now for =.

Users who know they are dealing with very small numbers
should have a way to switch to absolute comparisons, By
having to explicitly request that redefinition, the users
will possibly be reminded that they have increased the
likelyhood that the limits of the machine will confound
their results.

SS were removed before this feature was incorporated

        Also, will SD be able to Remove a particular
element of a display, as SS can, in the future, I
understand that midden probably has other things to
do, but, if SD will not have these feature for some

Yes, you're right. An analogy I find helpful, is that
all of those branching commands (next,back,lab,etc.) are
executed by the computer saying, "Aha" This is a reminder
to me---I will write it on the blackboard in case I need
it."

Then when NEXT or HELP or whatever is pressed, it looks on
the blackboard to see if there is a message there telling
what it should do.

Thus, the time of execution of the -help- command (the
writing on the blackboard) can be far removed from the
time at which HELP is pressed; and to get a new message
you must re-execute -help-.

to such results which is about 14 decimal digits. You

   I was delighted to find that you can quite easily make

and then using a "function-type" -define-. The best thing
about it is that throughout your program, it looks like a
regular two-dimensional array... This means that when
segmented arrays are finally available, I will only have to
change the -defines- and not a bit of lesson code!

define segment,myseg=n5,10  $$ to n14
       segarr(word,seg)=myseg(6?(word-1)+1+(seg-1))

This is a two-d (10?6) array with a 10-bit segment as
each element. segarr(2,3) is the 3rd segment of the

By the way, there is one thing that "function-type" array
won't do that "array" will do. That is to check on the
bounds of the array. Your definiton will allow you to say
calc mypiece (-4,500)?18 asking only that the -4,500
not take you out of range of the available student or
common variables. "array" checks to see if (-4,500) is
within the defined range of the array.

If your program is working correnctly, you shouldn't be
making out-of-bounds indexes anyway, so it is a drawback
only for the debugging stage.

Hopefully, when the segment arrays arrive, they will work

  Ah....while I have found no faults with the new SD
as yet.....It is beyond my ability to even attempt such
a project, not for lack of programming ability, but for
lack of the necessary system commands involved. Indeed,
if such commands were availiable to me, on of the first
things i would TRY to do would be to write a half-decent
micro editor(face it people, the present one stinks!).
  But then it's unlikely I will ever get access to such

who can use them.

Of course if you have both a term and termop in the

e.g.
unit      unit
term      unit
termop    unit
at      1212
write   unit

This will do an erase, however, if the term and termop are
reversed, the erase will not occur.

You may easily test it for yourself by outputting a mass
of draws to the screen, doing a catchup and an arrow

If it is, then doing the -draw-s (why not -delay-?) and

Well, to start with I believe that the shifted keys should

squares. If you believe it should be 4¬??4, fine, but its
going to be a square.

As for SD being to the left, I believe you meant to the

at 248,256 which does seem rather strange.

        Dear People:

        Having used the new SD/ID, I find that the SS option
is much handier to use in most cases. Creation of a dis-
play requires the moving of pieces around, deletion of
pieces of the display, and fast replots to "clean up" the
garbage made by the cursor. The need to effect changes to
the entire display is not as pressing as the need to inter-
act directly with parts of it. The internal workings of
SS seem to facilitate these things, whereas those of SD
apparently do not. I would consider highly the widsom of
SS before it is removed, and weigh the 2 facilities
more carefully than the systems staff has seemingly done.
        Are there any others out there who feel as I
do?

SD if SD is going to replace SS.

What makes sense to me is that Halvorsen (sS author) and

would incorporate the excellent features of _both_ programs.

Well, the way I understand it, the current SD was implemen-

the interim" until the new SD was installed. However, it
turns out that the interm solution is better liked by most
of us than the new one. I am sure that Marshall intends to
put in more features from SS eventually; however, I do
agree that SS should not be removed until SD can match it...

Presently, both keys act as if the NEXT key had been

Will there be a way to template the insatructor/author

all authors in the course rather than on an individual

A general interest question from psonotes:

   I've created a charset, and some of the spaces I'm using
are the 'micro' key spaces, ie (A), (b), etc...
   I later execute code similar to the following:

altfont on
writec temp1a,b,d,s,f, $etc..
altfont off

  It's somewhat more extensive than that, so the -altfont-s
are needed.
  My problem is: I can't figure out how to enter the code
in the writec so that when temp1a has the corresponding
value, the (A) char is produced. Or any 'micro' char, for
that matter. If it's in AIDS, then I've missed it.

Use the shift-square to force the access-code into the
character string. MICRO enters the access-code only
if "appropriate"-- and in this case there will be things
which seem "inappropriate".

While editting, use the "H" option to check for the
presence of the access-codes, because you won't be able
to "see" them in the typed string.

Your code will look this in the editor:
(for: aAbBfgl )

write   ¬a¬A¬b¬B¬f¬g¬l

Those letters which have related micro's will show up,
as ¬a¬A¬b¬l, but the others will just show as letters. However,
the access (076) is there as a hidden character.

---------- response 2
  03/22/76     10.20     gilpin       peer

For those who do not understand the problem--

In the editor, if you start a character string with a
FONT code, the characters you type thereafter will be in
alternate font, and if you have your intended charset
loaded, your result will look the same in the editor as
during execution. However, if you use -altfont- for your
font-change, then of course it works only during execution
and NOT in the editor.

This can be confusing, especially if you want to use access
characters--because the sets of letters that have access
mates are NOT THE SAME in alternate font as in regular font.
Thus, as Judy points out, you must use the square key to
force access codes whose effect you will not be able to
see while typing in regular font. They will, however, show
up properly during execution.

---------- response 3
  03/22/76     13.55     czwornog       mflu

Seems to me that the simplest way to do that would be
to first make sure you copy the comma character into
your charset from lesson -charsets-. Then just do this:

1  altfont on
2  writec  temp1,(font)a,b,c,d, etc..
3  altfont off

Then all you have to do is go to line 2 and _M_0dify away
the first (font) keypress.
This would let you see the characters as you enter them
in alternate font, but would only take up one extra key-
press in the line which could then be thrown away after
you have finished entering the line..... to re-edit this,
all you have to do is replace the font (temporarily) and
you could see exactly what you typed in originally.

Now wasn't that easy?

I'e made a change so that instructors cannot change the
security codes on a course. Among other things, this
means that an author will initially have to give a
change code before the course is usable -- but that is
reasonable, since an author must initially register the
first instructor in that course. It would be quite
sensible to have an option to create a course WITH an
instructor already in it, and with the change/inspect
codes set to nonsense.

Incidentally, it used to be that instructors could not
even SEE the course info page, which seems improper.

Correction -- instructors cannot change security codes or
file names (router, datafile, instructor file). Authors
will have to set up the course in its basic format. But
if enabled, instructors can fill out the text info (name,
phone number, etc.).

The line commented out causes the whole display to be

---------- note 267 Dvorak
  03/22/76     13.14     meers       wright

     It has been said that the original typewriter keyboard
was designed to either 1)slow your typing down so that
the old clunky typewriter strikers didn't jam up with each
other, OR 2) spell the word 'typewriter' easily.?
     Well, a man named Dvorak didn't go for that, and he
researched and designed an easier, faster keybard layout.?
    I have recently spent a couple of hours on a dvorak
(Dvorak Simplified Keyboard) typewriter (some of the larger
companies offer typewriters with dvorak layouts)), and I
found that I get along better with a Dvorak keyboard layout
than I do with the normal keyboard layout. In a short time,
I am sure that I will be able to go faster and with less
mistakes on a Dvorak layout than on the standard keyset..

        After a while I realized that switching keysets on
a computer would be a relatively easy task. The computer

---------- response 1
  03/22/76     13.15     meers       wright

does a table lookup for the internal value of *key*, so it
appears possible that a second lookup table containing
a Dvorak style translate table is feasible. Users could
toggle the dvorak keyset on or off with a 6th option on
the 'talk/ext/users list info page'. Once toggled on,
the author could then make use of the Dvorak keyset
anywhere on the system whether he go into notes, the editor,
term-talk, or condenses a lesson. The only time he would
have to revert to using the old-style keyboard is upon
the signon procedure, at least until the password page.

        Once you get past the dread feeling of a new style
keyboard layout, the rest is easy. See -dvorak- if you
are interested.

        Maybe when the labels on the keys are variable, too

I don't think modifying the keysets would be a desireable

keyboard to those (authors) that wish to use it. Imposing

Legend has it that someone did indeed once write up
such a translate table as you suggest. Legend also
has it that a copy of this table found its way into the
hands of a system programmer. I do not know where this
mythical table now is.
You do realize, of course, that the switch to Dvorak
could be handled by pressing DATA1 from the WELCOME page.

As long as a terminal reverted to normal upon signing
off to Press NEXT, there would be no danger of getting
a student trapped in the wrong keyset. Also, use of the
Dvorak keyboard would be a conscious decision, via
DATA1 on the WELCOME page.

My position is that a plato terminal which wants this
capability can have it for $500 (the cost of a keyset)
and some logic changes that are well within the
capabilities of an undergraduate ee or cs type. It should
be an option; a student that wants a qwerty keyboard
should be able to plug that in also. Software translation
tables are undesirable since two keysets are essential
to prevent confusion.

If one is going to go to the trouble of extra hardware

        This has been suggested before, but it is not
possible with the way the edit show routines work. They
display line using carriage returns to reposition for
the next line. Thus the editor does not know how long the
displayed line is and cannot reposition the arrow accord-
ingly. It allows two lines per line of code because no
line can be longer than 120 characters.

        I suppose it could be kludged by checking "where",
but it hardly seems worth the effort. If the overwrites
bother you, you can always clear the screen using the
white clear key.

   The computation of the proper place to put the arrow
was actually done once for a very short time, but it
was quickly eliminated due to popular demand since the
extra processing time made editing quite slow and much

the arrow will likely remain until some non costly way

I changed the showa momentarily one night so that it
went through the simulated plotting routine to get the

was completely inoperable, blowing off immediately upon
entry to edit any lesson since in those days we did not
have autobreak and anything taking over 25 ms in a time
slice without a specific -break- command gave an execution
error. The overhead is really enormous.

other courses using, say mrouter wish to add one of the

There is a system variable called "router" which holds
the name of the router attached to this user. For
authors, naturally, it is zero. You might do a check
like:

jumpout router ='myrouter';myrouter;q

Thus, if the user is attached to the router called
'myrouter', the jumpout to that router will take place;
otherwise, the student will just leave the lesson.

Just tried it -- a -jumpout router- returns a student to
his own router. i can find no reference to it in AIDS and

Does anyone know if this is an unannounced feature? I've
been using it for almost a year.

   The system should be viewed as having an upper limit
of about 10 inputs per second (for any one terminal) --
and this could be any combination of keyset, touch, or
external inputs. It is hard to find a way to accept
this many keys very often however without running the
TIPS of your program up so high that autobreak will
cause you to miss keys.

Touch is also slowed down by a less-than-optimal terminal
(not touch panel) design. If touch "echos" (i.e. beeps)
were handled in a similar fashion to keyset inputs(which
travel through the central computer before being displayed)
(echoed) then it would be possible to inhibit the echo
(turn off the beep) which speeds things up considerably.

---------- response 3
  03/23/76     15.10     t little       research

        The touch panel is slowed down by hardware in
the panel and not the terminal. The maximum rate that
the panel will send inputs is supposed to be set at
10 keys/sec. The components used are in the 10-20;
accuracy range so conceiveably the panel might send
much less then the actual 10/sec it is supposed to.

        Thanks to Gene Kelley for the info on the panel.

---------- response 4
  03/23/76     16.09     carter       comm

Well, Todd:
   The touch panel can be used in several different ways.
IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO SEND dATA RESUME BACK (a return
signal which produces the beep) IN ORDER TO READ VALID
DATA. Inhibiting the beep speeds things up considerably.
This is useful for adaptive cursors and some simulations.
The point is that the user should be able to inhibit
DATA RESUME; at present he cannot since it is internally
generated. I am aware of the 10 key/sec limit produced
by the NE555 timer in the touch panel. This is not really
a limiting factor.

---------- response 5
  03/23/76     19.41     blomme       s

   Please note that speeding up input for any device
over 10 keys per second is essentially useless on the
current system as I have already pointed out. Inputs
of a "tracking" nature, whether from light pens or touch
panels, are NOT viable on the current system unless that
slow rate might suffice.
   There might be possibilities on a future system of
handling/processing some data locally in an intelligent
terminal at a higher rate. I would guess that except
for special experiments, such a facility is unlikely to
be available to the general user for a few years anyway.
   i see little likelihood in the foreseeable future for
major expansion in the return data rate (although I hope
for some increase in that bandwidth) nor do I see sufficient
cup power (for the money) being available to provide the
centrl processing required to be able to guarantee higher
data rates.

---------- response 6
  03/23/76     23.55     carter       comm

I understand input bandwidth limits. The current design
is unfortunate since it makes anything more than 1 touch
per second impractical since DATA RESUME cannot be
inhibited. Future terminal designs should allow this
signal to be blocked. I get the impression that very
few people really understand the touch panel and its
somewhat offbeat uses. Its worth looking into.

You have a good point Jim, which I have thought about,
though I have never come to an answer that would be
satisfactory to everyone.

My ideas are generally that absolute and relative figures
are specified in terms of whole numbers of dots, and may
be sized from there. Graphing commands are specified in
whatever terms you want, and must therefore be calculated
completely infloating point rather than integer. For
relative commands, there is a minor efficiency in speed
if the numbers are integer, and a major saving in length
of condensed code.

I think relative commands should be designed around size
0 characters, thus allowing sizing to work on the whole
drawing. this almost eliminates cases like yours.

More user comments on this subject will be welcomed.

     But it isn't it a lot better to just point out where
something has been previously written rather than write it
over again. It seems like it would save time. Of course,
one could save as much or more time by Saving the earlier
rather than rewriting, but Systems personnel don't seem to
like that either.
     In other words, it seems rather inconsistent to
oppose _both_ of these time saving measures.

Psychologically, an occasional reminder as to why systems
people don't respond to every note is nowhere near as good
as a real response to the note, even if it only says, "I
read this". Systems people don't realize this, I think,
since they've never really been in the users' shoes on
this point.

        Ridiculous as it sounds, the only way to circum-
vent this is to put a flag in a note that says a systems
person has manually indicated he's read the note, and for
that flag to cause an appropriate message on the order
of "Read by Systems". These "reminders" will never go
away no matter what systems personnel say unless something
like this is done.

The PLATO Corrections Project staff has designed

The editor will be used by students and instructors in
correctional institutions for writing messages to each
other and to CERL project staff.

We wanted to design an editor which would be easy to
use and relatively simple to learn. Two new features of
TUTOR would make the editor more efficient:
-reedit- (already proposed by Bruce Sherwood) and
a command (similar to -jcount-) which would count the
number of displayed characters.

In any case, we invite you to see lesson "messages".

  Would it be possible to make available, as a system

would be nice to have in the following case.

  I am writing an editor for our own data base, and find
it necessary to merge two sets of alphanumeric strings.

The merged copy is generally of the form:
   <material from data area 1> <from 2> <from 1 again>

I do this under human control at an arrow, as it is
difficult to specify "what goes where" to the machine,
and use two different copy buffers (switchable by pressing
a key) to store the two sets of data. If I had the pointer
there would be no problem -move-ing the contents of buffer
1 to begin the third portion of the material.

  I am doing that, but it is not very accurate. I use
jcount and two variables to store the (approximate) count
for each buffer. The problem is that this does not allow
much editing of the material as this will affect jcount
and will throw the counters off, which causes the next
copy command for that buffer to either drop or repeat
parts of words.

  Making the count available would allow all kinds of
editing between presses of COPY.

  How about a systems "yes", "no", or "maybe?"

To have two copy buffers, and letting you switch

after the following questions have been answered:

Is it worth one extra word of ECS in the student bank

the copy buffers?

   Yes, it would be nice to have two. I have sometimes

It's not pretty, but does the job (within the limits
previously mentioned). I would be glad to make it available
as a base for any system effort.

More on ¬>.......

Having stated various half-truths, I finally went back
to the ¬> routine itself, and the present situtation is as
follows:

a=b if (a-b)= 0, or if ¬I (a-b)/b¬?<4?10?ˆ-12??, or if ¬Ia-b¬I<10ˆ-ˆ9.

a¬>b if (a-b)>0, or if ¬I(a-b)/b¬I<4?10?ˆ-12??.

So ¬> DOES partially compensate for round-off errors, but
not completely, and not in a way fully compatible with
what = does. This is what I should have said earlier about
being surprised some months ago to find that the full =
test was not applied.

And since a<b does not perform any round-off compensation at
all, it is possible for BOTH a<b and a¬>b to give -1.....

It seems to me that Bill Golden's suggestion is the best:
that all floating-point comparisons (=, ¬=, ¬<, ¬>, <, >)
should be compatible. One then conceives of the numbers
thus:

--------------------====++++++++++++++++++++++++++
      <              =           >

That is, there is a "fuzzy" region where floating-point
numbers are always considered equal, with all six logical
operators. Then a¬<b and a>b could not both be true.

It might be necessary to implement some special operators
(maybe $=$, $¬=$, $¬<$, $¬>$, $<$, $>$) which make no such
fancy checks and which could be used for special purposes.

    Why is it that the answer and wrong commands treat
the responses, mm and ¬mm, as identical? I can always
use something like -put- or -exact- to get around this,
but I had always thought that the match must be exact
with answer and wrong unless -specs- option were in
effect, and I have no -specs- at the -arrow- in question.

Thanks,

You should use "exact" to judge an exact match for your
answer, including extraneous spaces the student might have
entered, etc. The "problem" with answer/wrong is that
the <access> in "¬m" (which is an access-m, 07615) is
removed when condensing, so your answer command is changed
to "mm". You can get around this by using the "putd"
command:

putd $¬$xxx$
*    $,access,$,"xxx",$

and make your answer command:

answer   xxxm

which will take care of extra spaces and so forth, unlike
"exact".

Later...
Actually, I couldn't find any reference in AIDS to back me
up on the question of whether or not <access> is removed
from the answer command first -- is it or isn't it? It
looks that way...

   The preceding comments are incorrect: the access
code definitely IS processed by the answer judging
machinery. A simple unit with answer commands for
mm and ¬mm shows that the two are distinguished properly.
With nothing further to go on, I would have to guess
that there was some sort of preceding specs or put
that caused the problem originally stated.
   Unless people have at least run simple tests or have
special reason to know precisely what the system is doing,
it would help reduce the propagation of mis-information
if they would refrain from definitive analyses in seeking
to provide help to others.

lots of the preceeding comments are incorrect!!!

first off, there is an error in how first letter access-
consonants are handled that produces the ambiguity mentioned
in the first note of this series...this error will be fixed
as soon as a solution is found...
(note that ¬aa (an access-vowel) is handled properly).
secondly, do NOT use -exact- and -putd- commands to fix
things like this...it is a clear error in the system and
should be fixed NOT mysteriously programmed around. I am
sure the world will not end if it takes us a few days to
fix the problem while students can type in either "¬mm" or
"mm" for -answer mm-.

Perhaps this is a good place to state that at least 4
system (-s-) programmers read each and every one of these
notes! Please leave "delicate" matters like this to us...
it took me only 5 minutes to find the real programming error

   As I was going to add: leave the mis-statements to
the system staff, we manage to make enough on our own,
The fact is that the access code definitely IS processed;
the fact also must be that when I ran my test I didn't
notice that I got the same feedback from both mm and ¬mm.
As Paul Tenczar has indicated, aa and ¬aa ARE properly
distinguished!

        Back in -archival notes- dated 1/29 (specifically
note 469), there was a discussion about author deletion.
The intent of this note is not to restart that same
discussion, but rather to try to get the answer to a
question that was raised in that discussion and never
answered.
        The question is this: When an author is deleted
from a lesson due to high student use / times of high ECS,
is, or is not, the -finish unit- of the lesson from which
he is deleted done, or not?
        'david/hebrew' made comment to the fact that, he was
informed from a good source, that the -finish unit- is NOT
done as the system couldn't wait for even one time slice.
        How about, please, some 'systems' discussion on
this one???

---------- response 1

        The finish unit is _NOT_ done unless the SHIFT STOP
key has been pressed, via student, backout, or the system
pressing the key to free up ECS. Deleting the lesson from
ECS therefore does not do the finish unit.

As I recall the announcement of the new ECS allocator
(I'm too lazy to search for the note), it said that
from now on, STOP1 would always be pressed when an
author is deleted. Prior to that time, there were no
such guarantees.

However, I do most definitely recall that under the new

I think that is part of a general problem, including

it presumably should.

13 votes for SD meaning SD1, and SD0 meaning "insert ahead
of first line".

I've noticed that ID20 seems to mean "insert display
after line 20", as it always has, but it also seems to
assume an implied SD1 at the same time. Clearly, if I
want SD1, I should type SD or SD1; IDn (for any n) should
assume SD0.

I went in and deleted some blocks to make room for new code.
        When the printout arrived, the blocks I deleted
AFTER it was printed were missing!!!!

            was Done at TIME on DATE.

  Be aware that the above message is the only one that
should assure you that your file has actually been printed.
This message is initiated by an operator who is instructed
to only toggle the done message when he actually has the

        This can happen when the other person backs out
of paging at the moment you choose to answer. Depending on
the exact location of the talk program at the instant
you answer, two things can happen:
1) You can get the "Paging" message followed by a talk
arrow normally, or
2) You can get a talk arrow and an "end of talk"
simultaneously. This locks the terminal up for a few
seconds, then everything is erased.
        I have verified this with experiments at both
terminals at the Ed building here.

MICRO and shift-square are the same-but-with-a-difference.

The default micro table (the "system microtable"), does a
table lookup when you press MICRO-a, and finds that the
proper thing to insert into the character string is an
access-a. It happens that all of the "proper things" are
to insert an access code in front of the letter pressed,
or else to do nothing at all: MICRO-f produces nothing.

Shift-square on the other hand, always produces an access
code in the character string, whether it is appropriate or

In the old course records editor, when it was possible
to change user type, one could create an author record,
turn the external options on, and change the record to
a student or multiple.

Now. that is no longer possible, and if one wants to
drive external devices at another terminal, but not
leave a record signed into the lesson sending externals
(or if several lessons may send externals), one now
needs to sign an author record on at that terminal.

Can it be changed so that one can somehow send externals
to students and multiples? Possibly an option from
the welcome to plato page, automatically reset for
each terminal at sign-off.

     Mike Parker and I did some experimentation on
this problem. We found that the -showe- and -showo-
will correctly display a number from 2?ˆ-975?? to 2?ˆ1071??
 the problem seems to lie in the routine with the -show-
command. As writen in aids the default "absval" is
10ˆ-ˆ9 for the show command(optional third argument in the
show command).
       So if you need more precision you should use
the -showe- command or use the third argument of the
-show- command.
     Maybe something should be done inorder to obtain
more precision on the system calculator.

different from what is contained in the hardware research

     Since everyone is talking about term-talk how about
taking a close look at monitor mode? The person that is
being monitored is not told when the other person has left.
If the monitoree is writing to the monitor when the monitor
shift stops he can keep on writing indefinately as long as
he does not press next. Also even if he is not in this
position the monitoree is not told when the monitor has
left. He only finds out when the monitored by line stops
reploting or when hitting shift term gives him a what term.
      One last question. Why dosen't edit or shift edit work
in monitor mode like it does in term talk?

MORE MONITOR...

I have a suggestion in this department. I realize the
necessity of maintaining the normal function of the
function keys while in the monitor mode. Therefore it
does seem that the only reasonable way to terminate the
monitor mode is to STOP1 out. Or is it? How about this
one: Since the arrow in the monitor mode DOES recognize
-term-s, why not also build in a system term to signify
end monitor mode, such as "endm" or something? Please?

He's talking about the monitor_ee_, who can at present

never have to do this; I just let the monit_or_ press stop1.
It would be nice, tho, if I got a message when he/she does
that.

        An "endm" term sounds like a good idea. I realize
there is reluctance on the part of the system staff to
write new terms into the system, but this seems like a

We made a mistake a long time ago when -, was introduced
when we called it "universal delimiter". I guess the
idea was that it would work "universally" for -writec-s.

Since then we have been trying to expurgate "universal
delimiter" and call it "writec delimiter".
It would be very nice indeed if ¬, worked in other commands
besides writec and answerc, but it doesn't--yet.
Maybe someday.

   Why can't authors change the logical record sizes for
DATASETS. It seems to me that this change would be very
easily done and be quite useful to a number of authors.
By present means, it is HARD to do this and requires the
destruction of the DATASET and it's recreation. This,
of course, can only be done by the account directors.

on the subject of datasets, why isn't is possible to
copy from a common to the dataset with the system
editor? currently, you must create your own program
and set up the code yourself...not a high priority, just
wondering...

---------- response 2
  03/24/76     21.31     blomme       s
   In fact the way things currently are interlocked,
it would be possible to change the record size of a
dataset through the editor without risking damage (you
would be unable to change it if the dataset were in use
and anyone trying to use the dataset once you were editing
it would find it unavailable).
   I was originally inclined to do this but got so much
argument from others that I gave it up just to get something
(anything) working. It does seem, however, that such
a change would normally have major implications to any
programs referencing the dataset. And since there is
at least one way to set the record size, you may not find
too much interest on anyone's part in fighting any battles
in this area now.

What might have happened is that the system sent the message

I did a little more testing today, and it seems that
the person who does the paging gets a message that the
other person is busy, and when he presses next, the person

is not signed in ... unless he is on the press next page.

is available at any given time. (with some exceptions) the

Er, we DO have a "spare" drive, but we hold it in reserve
for maintenance times on one of the other drives, running
the backup system, testing and formatting new disk packs,
etc. However, we are to be receiving more disk capacity
in the not too (?) distant future, so I am sure that the
reasoning behind wanting to "purchase" a separate pack
for personal purposes will be at least partially cancelled
out.

Depends on how you deleted the message - if you use

If you try to delete the message by leaving a blank one

There used to be a simulation of that problem somewhere

definitely not efficient or fast! If all you want are
some solutions, I can give you some of those (send me a
p-note) from an old Machine Problem I had to do. A routine
to do it isn't hard to write, and I will help you if you
need it. Also, contract Prof. Friedman (friedman/csa) about
that simulation if you want it--but believe me, I hope you
have a soft chair! But a routine may already be written,
so let's hear it if one is on the system!

(The two circles differ by a single dot on the
left and bottom "sides", with the old circle
being outside the new circle. On the other
"sides", the circles are superimposed.)

The old method added the screen offset of the center
of the circle to the computer ?x and ?y positions,
and then truncated the results to form an integer
screen location. This truncation moves in-between
positions closer to (0,0) on the screen.

The new method truncates the ?x and ?y values to
integers before adding the offset to the center
of the circle. This truncation moves in-between
points toward the center of the circle.

The result, as you can see, differs only when
the ?x or ?y are negative, that is, on the left
and bottom "sides" of the circle.

  It is exchanges like this that give argumentation a
bad name. If someone makes an uninformed statement in
notes, I try to point it out in an objective manner.
They generally assume I am attacking them personally,
even if no such inference is possible from the note
itself, since they are conditioned by emotional
disagreements like yours in which personal animosity
plays a significant role. By all means add affective
emphasis to your comments ( for instance, it is perfectly
acceptable to claim your opponent's position isn't worth
the hair on a moose's ass[preferably stating why], but
don't call your opponent himself a moose's ass). The

Another note of general interest on restricted note files:
I just heard about -xxnotes- but find I am in a
write-only mode. Since I don't know what the file
contains, I don't know whether I would read the file or
not if I had access. In general, I am interested in
xxxxxxx Science CAI but am working on other things.

Unless this file contains a discussion of subjects that
are well-recognized to be sensitive (e.g. promotion and
tenure decisions) perhaps restricted access is
inappropriate. Professor Turoff's article in TFSC
(Technological Forecasting and Social Change, [a journal])
concerning open and closed societies provides the general
intellectual context for this conclusion. On a personal
level, I am just an Idaho country boy so I don't understand
why a xxxxxxxx science on-line conference should be
restricted at all unless it falls into certain categories
(tenure)

I recall a rather old book called "Principles of Social
Reconstruction" which claimed that men were usually
governed by one of two impulses, either the creative
characterized by openness and contribution while the
possessive response enjoys secrecy. Even on the Idaho
frontier, most have laid down the six-shooter, another
symbol of the possessive response, in favor of more
creative work. Cannot we high technology types do as
well?

Some advantages of open note files:
1) Openness provide accountability which encourages
responsibility.
2) Creative suggestion are encouraged from those of
peripheral interests--particularly important in inter-
disciplinary problem areas.

Note: I realize this is an unusual note. As a student,
I am interested in trying different dialogue approaches.

It would be nice to have "write-only" access; at least you
could send a note requesting "read-only". Many/most
restricted files do not even allow this luxury.

Could the initial default at GNOTE file creation time for
Other/Other be write-only, or even read-write, Dave? It
would reduce some unintentional restrictions that might not
be noticed for along time. Surely the assumption of open-
ness is to be preferred rather than the assumption of sec-
recy; restriction should be an active, not passive act.

Our gnote file is there so that our authors can discuss

pertinent comments into lesson cscomments. Our gnote

Groupnotes were set up as the analog for small groups of
personal notes. i.e. they are generally expected to be
private conversations. Anyone who wants public input may
use one of the public notesfiles or create another, but no
one should be made to fell guilty because he operates a
private groupnotes file. There are so many public notes
files that people keep requesting automated ways of keeping
track of them. There is a real need for private files too.

I do agree that groupnotes are for private conversations.

However, a second use for groupnotes is as a place to
leave a comment. Example: Suppose I try out a lesson
from "samples" on making Indian Masks, and find that I
simply cannot get past the page on -$ of eyeholes. If
there were some list of write-only groupnotes, then I
could send my comment to "anthropology", or "indian
studies", or even "american history", and expect that
it would probably get the the correct person (eventually).

In regard to judy's problem the real solution to finding
out who to talk to about a lesson is to have the lesson
caretaker's (may be different from author) signon on
the title page of the lesson. This would provide
immediate contact with the correct person.

On the larger question of GNOTES I agree completely with
Dr. Friedman's idea of write only for Others and understand
his reaction. After all, Group notes are for GROUPS and
not intended to be public note file though some have
decided to make their groups very large.

As one of the few tenured faculty members that actually
writes code, Dr. Friedman is to be commended for his
efforts. However, this same discipline has not extended
to his philosophy on conferencing, which is dysfunctional.
As a professional in the computer-based communications
field, I am concerned that conferencing will not achieve
its full potential if unnecessary restrictions are imposed.
A student should be able to actually monitor the dialogue
(an example of an 'invisible college') used in the
development of CAI courseware. Refusal to allow this
access makes no more sense than restricting standard
lessons. As I have noted previously, conferencing is
a central part of any serious effort at computer-based
graduate education.

I bring up these issues at this time since PLATO faces
possible financial hardship, which is sure to bring
out the possessive impulse in many people. Openness
on the system is a value to be protected. The unlocked
building is a symbol of this. Several years ago, even
the front office was open 24 hours per day!! (impossible
with the current clientile ). Don Bitzer once even
considered eliminating all inspect codes.

If there is a good rationale for closed notefiles, I have

but this advantage hardly compensates for the serious
discussion that is inhibited.

I am using a group notesfile as a means of extending class
discussion. It is used for that purpose ONLY. If I decide
to add another (linguistics) class, so there can be cross-
course discussion, I will add them---and that'as all. Just
because someone has a group notes file, he has not neces-
sarily signalled that he wants every one on the system to
enter it and leave remarks. If a group notes file IS set
up for general discussion, then I assume that the director
would change status only if someone habitually abused the
rights and/or feelings of others. But here are PLENTY of
reasons for closed group notes files.

"If there is a good rationale for closed notefiles, I have
yet to hear it," carter said 2 responses ago. That comment
still stands, since the last two notes merely continued the
argument of "I want my file closed." and "Some things are
PRIVATE!"

What an odd discussion on communications this is, where
people refute without giving reasons. The whole point is,
when you close a notefile, shouldn't you have a REASON for
closing it?

Then again, a I myself WOULD invite my kids into my bedroom.
I guess the point is, after all, that the reasons for closed
files (and "privacy, in general) are emotional ones, and
emotional reasons are completely legitimate. But perhaps
labeling them so would be a step forward in communications.
Isn't "Lack of privacy bothers me" better than "gnotes
should be private"? ¬????=?=Dan===¬=I=['="]=ˆˆ_
