---------- note 96 instr rvar
  01/01     15.04     michael       english

Would it be possible to allow a user type instructor to
have router variables which could be kept from session to
session?

---------- response 1
  01/02     14.10     b sherwood       phys

No. He should set up a student record for himself.

---------- response 2
  01/02     17.44     michael       english

I don't want him routed, just want to keep some variables
intact that can't be destroyed by lessons. But I realize
now that "records" is an instructor's router.

---------- note 99 -froml-
  01/02     09.58     michael       english

Any possibility of having a -from- command of the following
form:

from    fromvar;leslist
*
op maybe:
*
froml   fromvar

Both would have the effect of scanning the entire leslist
and putting in fromvar the index location of the lesson
in the leslist. It is extremely tedious and difficult to
use the current -from- command with a long leslist.

---------- response 1
  01/03     07.29     eric       weather

if you try to use the -addl- command to add a lesson to the
leslist, and the lesson already exists somewheres in the
list, then:
   1. the lesson name is not added a second time to the list
   2. the variable "error" will have the index number for
that lesson name.

if i understand your request right, then this should do the
trick...

---------- response 2
  01/03     12.41     warner       iu

The only trouble with that suggestion is that to -addl-
the lesson name you need to get it as a variable...which
"from" won't do any more, since the variable version is
obsolete!

---------- response 3
  01/03     12.56     michael       english

NO! It is not true that -addl- will not add the same
lesson name twice to the same leslist. Try it and find
out....

This still leaves the original need....

---------- response 4
  01/04     01.28     michael       english

AHA!!! One argument -addl- returns location of lesson on
aborted attempt to add duplicate; two argument -addl-
adds it, duplicate or not. Strange?!?

Systems response to original question please?

This feature would be very useful..

---------- response 6
  01/07     10.53     friedman       csa

Yes, very definitely this is useful and needed. I've
talked to systems people about this; they say sympathetic
things, but no one will commit to doing it! ?
Two algorithms are know to me (both coded by Dave Eland)
for "getting around" this lack. Neither is anywhere as
efficient as a command would be. Code is available from
Dave or me on request. Basically, one is a do (or doto)
loop incrementing an index for a command like
from yesorng;<index>;
This uses cpu like crazy, and won't execute in every case
within the limits of a finish unit. The other uses the
obsolete form of from, and addl (single tag type).

---------- note 100 check  data
  01/02     11.59     kane       phys
We found in cross checking between lesson-completed infor-
mation with the system router and scores recorded in a
datafile that we lost a significant amount of important
student data (scores on quiz-type lessons) due to system
crashes during last semester. I realize that this has been
brought up before, but let me ask again that auto-check-
pointing of datafile blocks be given some priority.
The use of a datafile (as opposed to a common) is a key
to the "transportability" of such lessons among the
schools attached to the system.

---------- response 1
  01/02     15.25     auld       mflu

 I for one agree with kane that datafiles should be given
priority even if I don't run students..........

       warren

---------- response 2
  01/02     18.20     david       hebrew

I also think datafile checkpointing should be done..
In the Hebrew curriculum, we keep all scores for one
grammar unit in student bank; when the student completes
the unit, we dump it in one huge 15-word block out to
the datafile. If there is a crash, the student is not
set back (since his variables have been checkpointed) but
most scoring information has been lost, since, at the
rate of 15 words/student finishing a grammar unit (takes
about 2 sessions of 30 min. each) we take a LONG time
to fill up a single block of a datafile.

Granted, I am aware that this will cease to be a problem
when the system does not crash any more, but until then
it would certainly be nice.

---------- note 101 line error
  01/02     12.42     meers       wright

site 24 seems to be down, or at least having everybody
elses share of line errors... Is this a local problem
or is it something at CERL?

---------- response 1
  01/02     14.12     b sherwood       phys

Please make these kinds of reports thru the terminal
repair machinery. That is the only way to insure that
the maintenance people will find out about the problem.

---------- response 2
  01/02     18.17     felty       o
     If I am not mistaken, the line errors were universal
in their effect, e.g., everybody was getting them. There
seems to have been a problem with the NIU, which apparently
has been corrected at this time.

  01/03     07.19     pete       faa

I was just looking at some old system features notes and

suddenly realized that they are of 1973 vintage. For

someone new to the system this maybe a confusion factor.

Systems may be able to put in something to indicate the

year the notes were made.

---------- note 115 sign-on
  01/03     08.38     walton       reading
Strange! In the new sign-on directions, one is told
to type his course, then press -STOP1-. But if one
types his course and presses -LAB1-, he is allowed to
sign on. Is this supposed to be?

Yes--but for your own protection, you should always use
Shift STOP (to avoid being fooled by dummy lessons that
collect codewords).

How about converting the time when you enter notes from
computerese to normal English. At present it says
01/03 8.35. At least it could be 1/3 8:35,
even better, it might say "Good morning, it is 8:35 a.m.
on Friday, January 3. Each little bit of computer stuff
like what you have now helps scare off computer-shy authors.

---------- response 1
  01/03     12.45     warner       iu

That kind of code is easy to write but takes up a surprising
amount of space! I can show you two examples, one in
lesson algprob and another in lesson cs4. One takes about
200 words and the other about 100. I wonder how much
importance this change really requires (although I would
like to see "14.40" rendered as "2:40 P.M." myself.)

---------- response 3
  01/03     13.57     judy       pso

Tatsuoka, your code uses 88 words of ecs, which is
"about 100".
And that doesn't provide the name of the day or month.

All systems lessons make compromises between ECS, CPU,
and legibility --- not necessarily the best compromise,
but _a_ compromise.

     As much as I hate to say it, I like the "military"
style of time listings. For a 24 hour system it is quite
efficient. As a matter of fact, I would like to see the
date listed in bureaucratic style also (right now it is
01031742R ((actually I am not sure if this is Romeo
time zone, but that's the idea)).
   In fact, instead of site numbers arbitrarily chosen,
I would like to see map coordinates. Many more bits of
information!

        One must to remember that a lesson with a unit
command has 52 words of ECS overhead. Keeping this in mind,
Tatsuoka's routine actually uses only 36 words. One can
even make his routine shorter by assigning v1?frac (v1)*24 in
the first occurrence of "frac(v1)*24" and using v1 in all
other occurrences. Also, the routine will not display
the proper format when the minutes are less than 10, but
this can easily be fixed by replacing the minute display
with...

---------- response 6
  01/04     15.16     b sherwood       phys

I might mention that the 24-hour scheme is called "military"
only in the United States. Most of the rest of the world
has used this system for years for all purposes.

---------- response 7
  01/06     10.42     lhn       mtcc

That is because the rest of the world cannot distinguish
between their government and their military. We Mericans
can tell because the military people wear those funny
hats. Or is the civilians who wear the funny hats?
(This comment ought to offend just about everyone which
means I'll have to keep my "keys" shut for awhile!)

 when I read your first prediction (Solomon Grundy, mailed
on Friday, arrived on Monday) I figured you had overesti-
mated delivery speed. While I appreciate your efforts to
predict downtime as far in adavance as possible, a more
pragmatic approach would be to wait until you have your
hands on the ECS and then announc a downtime (allowing
perhaps 24 hours or so for users to sulk and reorganize!)
     Good Luck,

---------- response 1
  01/06     08.53     k mast       p

      Possible, though it would require the maximum
number of words possible in a note be reduced. (It is
presently 72 words, and would be reduced to 67 words.)

---------- note 144 parameters
  01/04     23.12     mckeown       com

Every time it happens to me I can't help but think that
there should at least be a warning message on condense of
a do statement which has parameters, but which refers to a
unit which does not accept parameters. I can see no valid
reason why a programmer would do this intentionally.?
(I think this is quite different from the case where a unit
is set to receive parameters, but not all references to it
pass parameters.)

---------- response 1
  01/05     14.40     b sherwood       s

I sympathize, but it might be VERY expensive for us to
give you that warning. Think how the poor condensor is
doing its work. At the time that it encounters the
statement "do zonk(3,5)", it may not yet have encountered
unit zonk (which comes later in the lesson), so it just
doesn't know that there is an inconsistency. It would be
necessary to keep some kind of back-tracking trail to all
-do-s and investigate them when the unit is finally
encountered. Even looking up the nature of a previously
encountered "unit zonk" might involve quite a bit of
extra processing.

Sorry!

One nice bit of data that might be saved by PLATO would
be how much time an author has spent editing his lesson.
This should be comulative. In this way we can estimate
how long it takes to do a lesson.

---------- response 1
  01/06     12.02     blomme       s

   Most authors interested in such data get it fairly
easily by either
(1) setting up a new record and using it solely for
the authoring of the desired lesson
(2) noting the "hours on system" figure for the records
being used when starting and after finishing work.
   As many others have pointed out, the time on the system
is usually just the tip of the iceberg--the thought time
and design time OFF the system is often far greater.

---------- response 2

  and often a scratch lesson is made into a teaching lesson
after a few months of author training...i.e.. he does a lot
of extraneous authoring...

---------- response 3
  01/06     18.40     hody       med

this is something that was discussed at length in notes
a few months ago-- i am sorry i can't locate it easily...

creating a special record or manual time keeping is
unreliable and creates extra work and/or resentment
-- the information requested would be very valuable to
many course directors and is not being collected
probably because of the extra overhead involved
and the definite opinion of the part of some PLATO
principals that it is not needed.

it is true that simply keeping track of who edits what
lesson and how long would not solve all of the problems
of deciding how much time is needed to write a lesson,
but it would be valuable information nevertheless...

... maybe this would be a good subject for discussion at
the next campus users meeting.

I like the new data editor, but there also seems to be an
error, somehow. Student kelly was in pmals just before
noon, All data options were own. Only part of the data
is in the datafile (somehow starts with his 5th arrow).
The system did not crash or anything that I knowof.
The datafile is pmalsdata. Can someone explain?
        The same occured for student tonya in ccmath.
That datafile seems to be partially in the old style
and partially in the new style.

---------- note 153 rout storg

At the present time, storage declared in a router lesson
remains allocated to a student for as long as he is signed
on to the system (so that he is guaranteed success whenever
attempting to enter his router).?
Question: can we make any use of this fact??
For example, could we depend on values in that storage
remaining intact for as long as a student is signed on, even
if he should enter other lessons (which might use storage)??
 if so, could we get access to the router storage, perhaps in
a manner similar to getting access to router common? (This
latter use is just a curiosity. At the present time, my
interest is in the the first use mentioned above.)

I have the same problem. I solve it by a block copy into
student variables before the jumpout, and a block copy
back to storage in the ieu of the new lesson. Occasionally
it would be nice to keep more variables than this will
allow.

Gary, thanks for the lengthy list of back references.
I've just read them, so I feel ready to continue the
discussion.?
The original question, whether any values in router storage
continue to exist while a route_d_ lesson is executing,
is not explicitly answered. The implication is that
the values _do_ remain. I wonder if this can be confirmed!?

Yes, we have had the problem here, but it has always
gone away before the repair people could discover
what was wrong. Sometimes calling in again will
fix the problem, sometimes not. I have noticed
that you are often signed into a station number close
to our own, it may be that that modem (I think that's the
right name for the device) is intermittently bad.

You might contact Jim Knoke, (knoke of m) to get specifics
on what to do when it happens again.

Hope this helps.

The problem that you speak of is one generally related
to the specific phone line that you have gotten and is
most prevelant on dial-up type operation...
The reason that zero's appear on your screen but no red
light appears is because the error is in the "reverse" or
return channel (keyset, echo, etc.) and is mistakenly
"pushing" keys for you at the computer end of the channel.
It in general pushes "zero" because this character has
only one bit set and thus requires only a single bit error
to generate. The reason that it appears at the end of a
page of display data is because there is interference
between these channels...the solution?..redial if you are
on a dial-up call, put a message in "repair" if you are
on a dedicated facility. However, with long distance,
single terminal operation, small amounts of this problem
will always be present due to the nature of the
communication system...

The following is legal:

define a(x)=n(x+100)
*
IFF: -99 ¬< var ¬< so ; therefore:
*
calc a(-99)?number ¬) calc n(1)?number
*
which allows one to address arrays with negative indices
as long as the absolute address falls within student bank.

   The foregoing strategm is entirely legal, and as far as

(There _will_ be announced in the future an array feature
to keep them within a user-specified size. See lesson

Tests seem to indicate the following behavior:?
Given two lessons, one with 10 words of storage and the
other with 15 (both _with_ inhibit dropstor):?
    1. Jumpout from the 15 to the 10 succeeds, but lstorage
       for the 10 is 15 rather than 10.?
    2. Jumpout from the 10 to the 15 fails, giving an
       execution error.?
However, on at least 2 occasions, (2) above succeeded with
no error.?
The above is not documented in aids. What is the proper
behavior? More specifically, _exactly_ _what_ does "inhibit
dropstor" really do??

---------- response 1
  01/07     20.18     white       p

Inhibit dropstor retains your current storage length
and contents when you go into the new lesson. Even if
the new lesson doesn't have a storage command, or if
it has a storage command with a different length.

Larry, thanks for the clear answer.?
Dave (who's looking over my shoulder now) says he has
found that the execution error was the result of the
stoload command, which was coded to use the length
expected by the lesson; result was to execute a stoload
with length is when the storage (inherited from the
other lesson) was only 10.

   I hate to keep flogging a long dead horse, but:
if ya get 100,000 loops through each of these sequences:
*************
doto 1test,index?1,100
1test
* and...
calc   index?1
2test
branch (index?index+1)-101,2test,x
*************
  The -doto- takes 4.7 seconds proctim and the first takes
3.6 seconds: About a 33: difference!
  The -doto- looping is BUILTIN to the condensOr whereas
the -branch- loop is written in a mere high level language!
This seems to be an anomalous pathology present exclusively
in the TUTOR condensOr. FORTRAN, BASIC, PL/1, etc. -- ALL
have built-in looping CONSISTENTLY faster than make-shift
loops. Please bury this carrion beastie.

(Code is in lesson -van-, block -test-.)

---------- response 1
  01/07     20.27     white       p

If you try:

calc  index?0
1loop branch (index?index+1)-101,1out,x
      .
      .
      branch 1loop
1out

you will be closer to what a -doto- actually executes.
No guarantees have been made that -doto- will run
faster (or even as fast) as hand coded loops. What
has been said is that they will be easier to write,
easier to debug, and will make your program easier to
understand when reading it later.

---------- response 2
  01/07     21.45     bowery       comm

  I agree totally that -doto- is easier to read/debug!

reason and so do most people that I know - - so - - - -

ALL THE MORE REASON TO MAKE IT FASTER!
**************************************
I have faith that the system programmers are capable of
doing this.
  RE white: The goal of using -branch- looping here was
not to emulate the code but to mimic the behavior of -doto-
to a, hopefully and actually, more efficient end.

So who cares? 99.44: of all loops are small ones, the
most common being probably between 5 and 20. If this
system can't support the extra 33: for the occasional
100,000 pass loop, the system will FAIL!

---------- response 4
  01/08     11.07     b sherwood       s

Maybe it is worth pointing out that the -doto- could
perhaps eventually be speeded up somewhat by taking
advantage of the common special case of constant end
and increment values. The -doto-, like the iterative -do-,
permits expressions as end and increment specifiers, which
are not permitted in some other languages. This means that
in the general case the end test and increment involve the
extra overhead of evaluation, which is not present in
a language structure where these parameters are known to
be constant. It is possible that some day we might fancy
up the condensor to do something special when the parameters
are constant, something I think we do not now take advantage
of.

---------- response 2
  01/08     16.27     b sherwood       s

I don't understand what a "digital TV camera" would be.
Clearly you have to point a TV camera at the panel, not
pump 1200 bit/sec digital data to a TV monitor! Some
cameras give usable resolution. The most serious common
problem is that the camera is not very sensitive to the
orange light so that you get an unappetizing low-contrast
picture. This can be remedied by amplifying the signal
coming out of the camera, then using the contrast control
of the TV monitors to make the background black.

Instead of monitors you can of course also feed the
signal to a TV projector for display on a large screen.

---------- response 3
  01/08     18.18     warner       iu

The thing can be done using a dark room in which to
put the PLATO terminal. The TV camera must be sensitive
to the low light. We have had good success with a
Panasonic (I forget the model, but it's a turret
B¬+W model for CATV use--I can get the number if
you're interested.)
Do not use one of the cheaper cameras, like Sony
PortaPaks. They tend to burn in the image on the
screen very easily.
Using the Panasonic and a 4-way effects generator,
I have developed some graphics for our local channel,
channel 7, The graphics are in lesson "channel7".

Also: 
        Try one of the new 7-foot diagonally measured
TV screens. We did, with an admittedly outclassed camera,
and, if you cared to disregard the burning-in and the low
contrast image, it's pretty fantastic to see your PLATO
lesson in near movie size!

The highest possible resolution would be achieved by the
method used in at least one crt tty-compatible terminal,
the Adds Consul. In such systems, a semiconductor memory
holds a bit for each grid position on the screen. The
memory rapidly recirculates to refresh the screen, and
data is required form the communication link only to alter
the refreshing memory. To implement this kind of high
resolution display a specially designed unit would likely
incorporate a mini or microprocessor products such as
those used in the research labs at Cerl. This would be
costly to produce, but so is everything in this system.
Anyway, displaying P4 stuff on tv systems would probably be
appropriate only for certain demonstrations, so a system
as classy as this will probably never manifest.

Not sure whether there has been a note here to alert you

we will be using the builtin arrow character, which will
change the display of those of you who have used the
(undocumented, unannounced) character 126 trick to change
the arrow character. Note that Rick's suggested way of
doing this in the future can be a subroutine:

inhibit  arrow  OR    do    arrow(610)
arrow    610          ....
at       610          unit    arrow(w)

Ch, really? Now, let's follow that unit up in execution.
It -do-es the commands associated with the plot,
enters the arrow and prepares for judging, returns
(still in regular state) from the -do- level, judges,
enters search state and blows its ever-lovin' mind
trying to look for the original arrow!

Right?

---------- response 2
  01/08     21.17     b sherwood       phys

Wrong.

When an -arrow- command is encountered, TUTOR saves a
pointer to its location in that unit, AND ALSO saves
the trail of -do-s leading to that -arrow- command.
This makes it possible to get back to the -arrow-
whenever necessary and start from there at the
appropriate -do- level.

This is mentioned on page VII-44 of my book, though
not prominently.

---------- response 3

When you look at your variables in step mode, the alpha
seems to interpret a shift code as a space. Whoever fixes
this, I would really appreciate knowing how it happened;
I can't get either the regular showa or the embedded
showa to do it!

       All non-alphanumeric characters are interpreted
as spaces by the show routine. This allows the use of
special tricks to make the display faster. The octal
display is not altered, however.

Q:  Why did it take 4 hours to do the electrical work this
   morning?

A:  It took a little more than the expected 2 hours to do
   the wiring. Then when we tried to turn the power on,
   nothing worked. An hour of inspection and trial and
   error led us to find a timer which was set improperly,
   then the power came on. The computer and ecs passed
   their tests and we tried to bring up PLATO.
   An immediate ECS error stopped that. Another half hour
   of tests and the problem was cleared up. So here we

What would the general consensus be to being able to read

I know that many times I am doing compares between two 
different sets of code, and I either have to bring one set 
into the block I am working in or switch back and forth
between blocks relying on my memory to serve me.

If we could at least see our save buffer -- something that

believe.

If I understand your question correctly, I think you would 
like to be able to switch on one key from your current 
block to the save buffer in the same kind of editor.
May I suggest that, without confusing things, you can 
almost do that now by creating a non-condensing block
with a copy of the same code immediately adjacent to the 
current block. The only feature which would then be lacking
would be the one-key switch to the adjacent block. Seems to 
me that this switch would be easier to implement, and also 
more generally useful.

Another consideration is that usually a lesson will be

creating another block would be either impossible or
too much of a hassle. Seeing the save buffer is what 
is needed.

Just before the jumpout. calc the name of the lesson into
n1. Then the -DATA- key (and all the others) are active
just as if you had pressed -STOP1-.

Another neato thing you can do is -course n1-.
Then pressing -NEXT- on the author mode display takes you
to editing your course. Which is a bit more useful since
not everyone has a file with their name on it, but
each of us is registered in a course.

Also, you can -calc- some garbage into n1, which makes
"does not exist" a real threat to your random keypresses
on the author mode page.

Or you can -calc- the value of some other lesson, and the
-DATA- key will take the game player to that other lesson.

On the other hand, don't get too complex. They promised
to fix it someday, and all our fun will be gone.

The ECS arrived and has been installed and tested. As

on the old ECS during prime-time and on the new (or the

Perhaps someone could develop a piece of code to be placed
say in imain and then have the choice of arrows up to
the author without too much work. Thus, the default
arrow will the the hardwired arrow and the imain choice
(or imain type choice in ieu or perhaps a flag type command)
could be chosen if wished. this would save all those
authors from having to rewrite their code putting in

Just replace every -arrow- command with "do arrow(x)"

          Notice that the simple unit suggested to
     solve the problem of plotting your own arrow
     doesn't erase the arrow after an acceptable
     answer is typed in. So if you want that feature
     it means adding more code to the lesson. Sigh!

---------- response 4
  01/16     02.25     blomme       s

   Trying to decipher what is being asked:
(1) The "automatic" plotting of an arrow will continue to
occur whenever you give an arrow command (and haven't
inhibited the arrow)...however: you will now know for
sure that you will get an arrow and not some weird char
that someone loaded in another lesson.
(2) Indeed, the message in the charset editor that says
that slot 126 is reserved for the arrow will be removed
...and, indeed, any character position could do as well--
but 126 is probably currently the least likely to
interfere with anything else.
(3) The changes to the system to use the wired in arrow
were made some time ago, and the latest versions of the
system have been using it for some time. I think that
a version with these changes will soon be running during
prime time--but we are loading char mem slot 126 as well
for a while longer to give some folks more time.

Effect: a storea command would put spaces (055) trailing
at the end of a character string at an arrow, instead of

a short bit of coding, but it would be nice sometime
to be able to specify it at an arrow.

When editing a lesson, many is the time I have entered an
edit command and its numeric tag, and then a little later
(having gone off on a different tack and forgotten the first
command which had been entered but not executed) I enter a
second command and its numeric tag. Result: the second
command is ignored, but the numbers entered are appended to
the first command which had been entered. The net effect is
always a pain in the neck...?
Question: could this behavior please be modified !?!??
Preferred solution would be (I think) to have the entry of
an edit command override any other command which may be in
effect.?

It would be nice if when using vertical segments one could

'Twould appear much more useful in my view to allow
vertical segments to repeat in the same word (if we were
to get some change). E.g., if I had some info which would
fit very nicely into 30 bits (in units of 6 and 24 say),
I would code: (with appropriate indentation):?
segment,vertical,acct=n1,1,6,30 $$30 is frequency of repeat
segment,vertical,amt=n1,7,24,30,s?
This type of thing occurs quite frequently when I am using
segments.

---------- response 2
  01/14     10.36     warner       iu

About defining segments to occur in every nth word,
you can do that right nicely with a double define, i.e.

define segment,vertical,segx=n1,10,20
       youwant(x)=segx(5x-4)

then youwant(1) is in n1, youwant(2) is in n6, etc. every
5 variables.
   So many of these things can be done easily with
double defines that people want as options in the
segment feature.

---------- response 3

One reason for vertical segments, on top of normal
segments, was that more efficient code could be
generated by the condensor. But Warner's suggestion
probably produces code about as efficient as one could
expect the condensor to do.

then wrapping arond to the beginning and proceeding up as
far as the itme at which I started. The operation is,
by nature, a little messy - moreso with -doto- than with
-do-.

Thus a proposed command (or -calc- option):

dotoc label, var?start,terminal,step,startlist,endlist

which would start at the start?ˆth?? element, proceed by -step-
to -terminal-, wrapping around from -endlist- to -startlist-

This is another of those problems that can be solved with
a one-line define, to wit
upto(x,y)=1+(y?frac((x-1)=y)
If you are searching a 32-word list, then you can write
doto 1list,i?1,32
j?upto(i+base,32)
branch list(j),1etc....
or you can simply make another define, which expands the
code in condensed form but uses one less variable: define
reltvi=upto(i+base,32)
then
doto 1list,i?1,32
branch list(reltvi),1etc...

   I realize the in many cases it is profitable to use
defined functions over creating new features in the
condensor/compiler, HOWEVER in this case it is far less
efficient to use Warner's modulo function. The implication
that this had not been thought of is insulting. Please
understand that in this and other notes where people request
new features, it may be possible to write code that will
preform the same operation but that that is not the point.

  Unless the efficiency and/or ease of use could not be

doto label.var?<list1>;<list2>;<list3>;...

where <list>=var¬, firstvar,lastvar ¬, firstvar,lastvar,step

This would allow the variable in the doto to be broken

would it possible to change the present set-up so that when
an author tries to edit a lesson and is asked for the
lesson's security code the system would compare the code the
author types in with the lesson's code and leave the
author's present security code intact (rather than _changing_
the author's code). Our course uses a number of lessons with
different codes for communication, etc. and it gets frustra-
ting having to continually go back and change your security
code each time you finish editing a lesson.

---------- response 1
  01/14     17.43     berger       users

Since the system in its present state can't discriminate
between those times that you want the code changed, and
those times that you don't, this would necessitate a
special feature that allows the change to be made. If
this were to come about, people would be typing in more
codes than they currently do, and it would probably be
a very unpopular feature. If it were done with a special
jkey at the password page, it might be acceptible.

I see your problem, but I like the current system.

Frequently I use one code and make 5-10 entries into the
lesson, and then switch to another lesson and make 5-10
entries. The code attached to my author record rarely
stays "current", since there are 3 codes I use constantly,
and probably 5 more I use frequently.

(Granted, I probably have an excess, but surely most busy
authors have 2 or 3..?)

If you were going to start editing a lesson for a period

fantastic idea... also perhaps a temporary off option
which would give a message "you can not talk to

sometime... the latter would be helpful where you
want to be incommunicado for a short period and

Good idea! This option could perhaps be linked with "alarm"
so that if requested to do so, "alarm" would turn off or on
a person's talk options at a particular time.
Another idea in the same vein has been already brought up
but deserves repeating: perhaps a "talker" should have the
option of adding a 20-character message to the "talkee"
that appears alongside of the ring. Would be very helpful
for weeding out "Hi, whatcha doing" calls from serious ones.
Perhaps the same option could be used with TERM "reject",
so that the "talker's" screen might show a message like:
"rejected: call back at 5:30" or possibly if necessary
"rejected: bug off, shmo!"
This would be a great help to PLATO communication;
to people who need to reject a term-talker but want to
talk.

Just to be serious for a moment:
The problem is not that such a feature is necessary.
It exists (to tell someone that you're busy).
The problem is that "rejected" has some very misleading

insult, there is no problem.

Maybe all that is needed is to change the "reject" naming
to "busy". I agree..... I hate to deliberately refuse
a call.

If you could type "busy", you would acknowledge that you
_did_ see the call, rather than being momentarily absent
or distracted.

It would be more like the
"joe of schmoo would like to talk to you" message that
you get when already talking.

   As far as talko is concerned, with the present -terms-

leave the lesson and reject or talk or whatever...As for
the "busy" option, I think a good place to put it would be
along with your other options in -user- where you could
turn on an option to print this message to any callers for
a certain period of time that you were "busy but will talk
later"......Then when you were available for conversations
you could turn the option off......

While were on the subject of functions, why dosen't plato

does not give an answer acording the the official
definition of the integer function when the argument is
negative. The definition is int(x)= "the greatest integer
less than or equal to x"

I thought jumpout was supposed to check to see if the lesson
to be jumped into will fit in ECS. In stead, it seems to
be checking to see if there is any room in ECS, and if there
is enough room for _some_ lesson, it looks like it tries to do
the jumpout. The problem is that this particular lesson is
big, and the students often end up on the No ECS page.
If there is absolutely no ECS control passes to the command
after the jumpout. just like aids says.
The lessin command doesn't help, since I don't really expect
the lesson to already be in core. And I don't want to check
muse and mallot, stnce the size of the lesson varies.

---------- response 1
  01/14     17.48     berger       users

The system obviously can't know exactly how much
ecs a lesson will consume. and sometimes it has to
attempt the jumpout and hope that there's enough room.
If this is not acceptible. I think that the only
alternative at this point is to wait for an 8000 word
ecs buffer before allowing a jumpout. This insures that
the jumpout will always be successful. Of course,
it also means that many more jumpouts will fail than
did before.

Or you might allow the author to somehow specify the
minimum amount of ecs necessary for the lesson he's jumping
out to. Which would tell the system how much he needed
_before_ the jumpout. If the author didn't specify enuf ecs
and the lesson gets blown off that his problem.

I understand that PLATO keeps 'binaries' of lessons
if they were condensed by students, and have not been edited
since that time. Is this true? If so, doesn't PLATO know
immediately exactly how much ecs the lesson will take
(assuming there is a binary available). Since the lessons
I need are virtually guaranteed to have been condensed by
students (and recently), binaries should exist. Or is
'binaries' just a vicious rumor?

Having a random number function would also make

   It all starts to get back to the old:
all writing operations within write command via embedding
  etc.
all calculation operations within calc command via special
  names and functions.
OR
   The separation into (hopefully) more readable form by
different commands. Where the "line" gets drawn is
often tough to say. I think my own preference tends to
be to create a new command to do a major new job in its
entirety if it is really important, rather than trying
to "embed" more things in the calc command because it
will make things slightly more "efficient." If the
entire function/job is important enough, the efficiency
can be increased many many times by providing special
code to do it rather than the slight differences involved
between embedding or not embedding.

How do continued -calc-s compare to regular -calc-s

In one lesson I am writing I have a -doto- loop that repeats
64 times, each time using a random number. This makes
it impossible to store the random numbers before entering
the -doto- since I would need 64 variables for just random numbers!
With a random number function I would not need to
interrupt my continued -calc- to create a random number
to use.
If continued -calc-s are no more efficient than inturrupted
ones then it would make no difference, but from what I have

I think it is a necesary thing and it would be much

 sometimes it is necessary to have to repeat a semi-random
sequence of numbers and you would only have to store one
number to repeat it,the seed..
continued calc-s are much more effecient than
 calc n1?1+n1
randu n2
calc n1?n1+n2

there is no way to define a decent random number function

                   from 0 to 1

calc n1?nrand(seed,range) where nrand gives a random

        Since I made this suggestion in a response to a
note and seems to have been overlooked, I'd like to make
it again in a note all by itself.
        How about a modifaction of the -doto- command to
the following:

doto    label,var?<list1>;<list2>;<list3>;..

where <list(i)>= var¬, firstvar,lastvar[,step]

        The effect of this would be to break up the doto.
eg

doto    1a,n1?1,4;13;5,0,-1

would result in the loop to 1a being preformed with n1
being assigned the values 1,2,3,4,13,5,4,3,2,1,0.

I doubt that this can be called of necessity.
There are not that many times that something of this sort
would/could be used. For those few times that something
like this is needed, it seems that there would be some
easy way to solve the problem in tutor.

In CSO, this was done a few years ago: the time stamp was
added automatically to any message from the operator to
Plorts users. And it was done for the very same reason
suggested here: that after numerous reminders, operators
still sent out messages like "going down in 10 min" with
no indication of when the 10 minutes started. Now, with
a time stamp automatically supplied by the system, Plorts
users no longer have this frustration, and CSO's operators
are no longer hassled about it.?
I recommend it to Plato whole heartedly.

Our CDC engineer has a rather different view of his priority
around here!

He is faced with a very large task of keeping up the PLATO
computer and bringing up another million words of ECS. He
has repeatedly been denied very reasonable requests for time
to work.

So far, only 4 hours of the time reserved for users has been
taken. It is quite possible that no more prime-time will be
needed. Users must understand that they share non-prime
with the system staff and hardware engineers.

ECS takes about three weeks of use before we will be
will be willing to trust it. That's three weeks AFTER it
is working. When shall we start counting if we don't let
the engineer fix it so it works?

---------- note 454 allocate?
  01/17     09.26     david       hebrew

Given the following situation: (repeated three times)

Logical site 6 has a base allotment of 45000 words
of ECS, is currently allotted 55800 words of ECS and is
using only 3000 words of it -- (two authors).

One author condenses lesson XYZ (3582 words) and runs
in it for, say, i minute. He then goes out for 30 seconds
or so to look at a lesson which XYZ -use-s. Then the
author returns to the Author mode page, types in lesson
XYZ's name, and presses -DATA- and gets the "waiting
to condense" message.

Nobody else on the system at the time knows the code to
lesson XYZ to take it out from under the author, and the
other author at the site is only editing.

QUESTION: How come there isn't enough ECS (some 40000
words) to keep the lesson in for 30 seconds?
---------- response 1
  01/17     09.51     b sherwood       phys

A lesson is subject to deletion if no one is presently
in it. It has nothing to do with what site originally
brought it into ECS. In fact, once there is no one in
the lesson, it is no longer assigned to any site at all.
So deletion is by pure chance, unbiased by how much ECS
your site happens to use.

---------- response 2
  01/17     09.59     golden       s

Requests for ECS space occur scores of times each second.
(There is a lot more in there than just the lessons which
come to mind first.) As each request is made, the alloca-
tion program scans ECS for some unused space. When it finds
some, it has no way of knowing how recently it was in use.
The mistake you are making is to assume that there is some
completely empty ECS. Not so. All of it has been used
hundreds or thousands of times. All of it is filled. But
some of the items filling it are not in use. So, when the
request for space comes in, some of the not in use items
are dumped. Often a three-thousand word lesson might be
dumped just to get a temporary 400 word buffer for a talk
option. Hope this helps explain.

Don't be harsh on yourself, David!

I can assure you that a large number of system software
people have been totally confused in this area many
times. And as you know, the ECS allocation schemes
have been changed many many times (and are about to be
changed again when we add the new ECS).

Another related request: would it be possible for monitored

if this were possible.

Being able to use term to talk in a lesson would be

---------- response 4
  01/17     19.50     little t       em

I think what the gentleman means is that in fortran you
can follow the condition with a number of different kinds
of statements, whereas in tutor you do one kind of
statement. an example:

if a.eq.b goto c
else d=g

goto  a=b,c,x
calc  d?g

      So in essence the same things are available but
through a different approach.

Remember that there are MANY commands in TUTOR which can
be made conditional -- like write, calc, exact, <all the
branching commands> -- and you can often manufacture your
own conditional statement!

Now, higher-level languages such as ALGOL are a little
harder to replace in TUTOR...a complex nest of IF's, for
instance......

  I've never heard this requested in notes before so
here goes:

When the calc compiler runs into unbalanced parentheses
could it (like many other time shared compilers) say
where the unbalance is? ie:

or something to that effect. Complicated -calc- s would
be much easier to debug that way.

---------- response 1

---------- response 4
  01/20     15.39     bowery       comm

  The compiler MUST keep a count of the number of right
as opposed to left parens some how.. like add 1 if
a right is encountered and sub if a left etc... so
if after a line is scanned the counter is not zero...
the counter would indicate which and how many parens
were missing. Try writing a compiler that doesnt
keep track of this data. If you do it ill buy you
a large garcia's pizza of any kind and a six pack of beer
or fanta or whatever.
(one qualification.. it has to work)

---------- response 1

It is intended that once groups are able to control their

the things CERL presently does: create, destory, rename,
change type, make a router, make a copy of a file, etc.

It seems likely that this will happen before summer. A
group would be given a block of disk and would have to
allocate the division among courses, lessons, datafiles,
and datasets.

        The second zero is your course which is zero since
you haven't signed in yet. That check is insane since that
defeats the purpose of providing that material, i.e. they
want to have some information about what shape your records
were in when it tried to return them (out error... error in
signing off the system, usually your records couldn't be
found on the active disks).

   The ECS was installed about a week ago now...testing
is continuing. This response is being written with the
system running on the new ecs. It may be another week or
two before its reliability is such that allocations can
be increased. From now on we will be using it during
non-prime time so that it can be "exercised" and tested
under actual system loads.

During non-prime time, messages are posted on the

sent through the special message-at-bottom-of-screen

   Gentle-people:
Your comments are presumably both inappropos to these
general (permanent) notes and also misleading to some
other authors. The prime time flag DOES work and works
correctly. It will be available soon, and it has been
announced (like all other new features) as soon as it
was implemented.

---------- response 3
  01/20     07.36     avner       s

The purpose of such early announcements is to warn everyone
of changes which might cause them problems in time for them
to respond BEFORE the problems occur (in the case of ptime,
this is not a consideration), and to allow people time to
consider appropriate implementation of new features. New
features are tested for several days or weeks during non-
prime time to insure that they cause no general problems to
the existing system (insqfar as possible to determine with
the reduced load conditions of non-prime time). Hence, some
but should be aware that said feature may not yet be
available during prime time.

---------- response 4
  01/20     09.17     warner       iu

All well and good, BUT there is no way to test this feature
given the above requirements. In fact, this new feature
will work just as well when not implemented on the prime
time version with the statement
define ptime=0.
In other words, ptime branches will never be executed.

I'm not current with notes, so perhaps this has been said,
but it might be better to reverse the functions of the
-NEXT- and -DATA- keys from the author mode page.  It really
is confusing to non-authors being given demos on author

with -NEXT- except to run lessons???).

---------- response 1

     Author signons are functional to do just that...Author.
I have heard of suggestions high up in the plato staff
to make the Author Mode display functional to run only
the editor and lessons for which the requesting signon has
a security code (inspect and/or change).  So considering
this... well be thankful they even allow you the -DATA-.

(of course if it ever were restricted I'm sure CERL would
be in grave physical danger from certain pathological

The current convention seems, to me, to be a logical ones
in that as an AUTHOR on the AUTHOR MODE page, one would
type in a lesson and press NEXT to _author_ it -- right?

Of course this might conceivably be confusing to the non-
author type, but if I might comment on "being given demos
with author signons", it is my opinion that unregulated
use of author signons should be discouraged. Write instead
a lesson that uses a leslist of good demo lessons, and run
your people through that.

I will admit that I STILL occasionally press NEXT instead
of DATA on that page, but it IS more logical!

A major reason for making NEXT edit the file and DATA
enter the lesson is that a disk access to get the
file directory is much less expensive than an inadvertent
condense...... NEXT is just too easy to hit and cause an
expensive condense every time you actually meant to edit.

  An automatic variable micro load for an author record
when ever that author entered the editor? Just think
about it.. How many people are not aquainted with
the value of an -editmicro- of their own design simply
because of the hassle of reloading it everytime you try
out your lesson? this would be orders of magnitude
better than a -term micro-  alone since usually a person
would not be changing his programming mode as often as
once every recondense.

  Then when you do change programming modes you could
press 'M' on the AUTHOR  MODE  page and respecify the
micro.  Are there enough bits floating around for this?

        The copy-a-block change was for technical reasons
more than security reasons, as it was discovered that if
you are trying to copy-a-block from a lesson that is being

limits one of the biggest advantages of the system...the
dissemination of expertise from one site to another. Every

   The concern of some for "security" which apparently
means they do not wish others to make copies of their
lessons or lesson segments is all rather silly. It is
quite similar to those individuals that never present
promising preliminary results at technical meetings for
fear it may encourage others to get into the same line
of research, and perhaps do a better job.
   If someone thinks highly enough of a lesson to copy
part of it, or if a preliminary report encourages others
to investigate similar issues, this should be taken as
a compliment by the original programmer/investigator.
If the originator is sharp, he will be making progress

some people who like to "experiment" from CRASHING the
entire system! Sorry, but changes of this sort are
essential; the impact on security, flexibility, etc.
simply has to be secondary. In fact, though, this change
is in line with the policy on prints and searches: a
fairly "heavy" system loading feature is restricted to
the authors with (presumably) real need/use for the
feature and "browsers" must struggle more to achieve the
same end. The save feature IS still available when
in inspect and copying is thus possible in that way if
you have the inspect code to a lesson.

Paranoia is not the object of the changes I was suggesting,
but just the opposite. And while it may be complementary
to have your lesson copied, it is not always wise. I have
several lessons from which I would like to remove the
inspect codes since I am often asked how a certain effect
was achieved. Certain of these are "games" though, con-
taining time and site restrictions. It has been the ex-
perience of some authors of games in the past that having
a blank inspect code inevitably results in past that having
being made -- copies which then are modified so as to
allow entry at any time. THAT is why I am reluctant to
remove inspect codes which I truly would like to. Call
that paranoid if you wish, but tell me how many copies
of "dogfight" do you want in ECS during prime time? There
exist at least three already if they haven't been destroyed.

        My feelings exactly Rick... I am organizing myself
now such that essential "secret" code is going to be stored
in a global inspect coded lesson, used by the open lessons.
I'm glad to see this option placed in line with all of the
other "big crunch - does lots" things...

Students condense first! They condense basically in the
order they entered, with students first entering having
condense priority by reason of their not having used the
condensor before.
Authors come next, in the order of their frequency of
use of the condensor. A new entry is inserted in the
list by fitting him just below all persons with higher
priority. This means that if you condense as an author,
and 43 students come in condensing one lesson, the
queue will go from 1 of 1, to 44 of 44, then to 1 of 1
again as all 43 students' lesson is condensed.

Courtesy would suggest that immediately after a crash
authors should not try to condense for a few minutes until
the classes have safely resumed. As has been pointed out,
your priority will probably be low, and you might as well
edit, or file your nails, or something, as sit and look at
"22 out of 37" for 5 minutes.

---------- note 600 datasets
  01/21     14.04     golden       s

There is an annoying problem associated with datasets which
are longer than six parts. If you read and write more than
one block at a time, it is possible to write some data in
a "space! between the last block of part six and the first
block of part seven.

Sometime soon we expect to change the system so that doesn't
happen. But when that change is made you won't have access
to any data which was previously written in that "space".

Therefore, I recommend that if you use long datasets, you
do only one-block reads and writes until we fix the error.
If you must do 2 or 3 block reads and writes, I recommend
you keep your datasets six parts or less.

---------- response 1
  01/21     20.37     blomme       s

   The precise problem occurs only if you read/write
more than one block at the boundary between 6 and 7 parts
(block 84-block 85). A simple check for a multiple
read or write starting at block 83 (3 blocks) or block
84 (2 blocks or 3 blocks) and a conversion to two
separate accesses to prevent crossing the boundary fixes
the difficulty.
   This problem has been known for around 6 months and
affects nothing else in the system except datasets which
are over 6 parts long AND which do multiple block reads
or writes. It certainly WILL be corrected, but it has
not been viewed as an essential item compared with the
numerous other jobs to be done...we can (and will) "cure"
this by limiting all datasets to 6 parts if it is viewed
as a serious problem by someone.

The new ECS will NOT solve all your access problems!

It will make life immeasurably simpler for people at
sites with 10 (8?6?) terminals, but the improvement
on "network" will only be modest.

"network" will receive space just like everybody else,
but it is so much harder to coordinate that the space

since the new requirement for a change security code
to enable the copy- a- block option is causing a lot
of trouble, here is an alternative suggestion if the
room and overhead is not too much:

have a) a new "ok to copy" code which can be specified
or left blank...and since that will make a lot of
codes to put into the data page, b) have a default NEXT
option to copy codes into the blanks once one is
entered....or some other way to template the code...

if there is no room in data page for this, combine it with
another of the codes...

presently the situation is difficult!

by the way, to be consistent, the editor "save" option
should also be disabled when editing in "inspect only"--
and that still leaves the determined folks with the
varian copiers, polaroid cameras, dictating devices, ...

I have not been affected by this change as yet, but...

Instead of a new code (or further confusing the old ones)
how about a flag something like the partial flag.
Each block could have a "copy flag". The default setting
would be flag set (Change code required), and the toggle
value would be Inspect code required.

The flags could be set by say S(et flag) on the block page
(or some other unused capital command).

I realize this would take 14 bits per lesson part, but it
does seem a feasible solution if the bits can be found.

from what I understand, the varian is a little less

expensive to waste on anything like code, and a dictation
machine is quite a bit of work.. ..

This change code to copy stuff came about because of some
system problems.... not just to keep non-inspect coded
stuff from being copied.... If you leave your
inspect code open, and someone wants to use the code
for his own purposes, there is not a lot to stop him

Proposal:
The removal of all lessons that have not been used or
currently being used from disk. The lessons to be deleted
should be stored on some off-line device (ie. magnetic tape)
And for a lesson to be set up the would contain information
on each lesson (ie. description, location, name, date
stored, etc.). Courses apply also to this proposal.
Reason:
To utilize otherwise wasted disk space for new lessons and

Agreed, but it would be assumed that the author would
know better than anyone else, therefore it would seem
logical to assume he would have to decide himself, if the
author is no longer at plato i would suggest that the
director or instructor of the course in which the lesson
is used would have to decide at any rate it isnt as though
the lesson was to be destroyed entirely, simply removed
from active files. If a need should arise for the lesson
in the future it could still be placed on active file
again, and when not in used removed.. Just that plain simple
again,

This is currently being done. The community colleges
recycle many of their lesson spaces. Unless you can
specifically point to a particular project that is
"hoarding" lesson spaces, all your suggestion boils
down to is a reminder to all authors to turn in any
lessons that they don't need. I doubt that you'll get
a very great response.

that is not the point, whether the projects hoard, or some

lessons on plato, particularly games that have not been
used in eions. The suggestion is only made to make that
space available to an author for a course lesson. after all
the systems number one priority is not i repeat not games

are many unused lessons on the system in the first

Hold it, grohne... such a change would be ridiculous...
currently one need go into one lesson, transfer the common

      be possible to make it much smaller especially
      if you would take out such seldom used items

   Work has been in progress for several months on
a new terminal design. A parallel write panel will
be incorporated (making block erases possible) as well
as a micro processor. The time lag from now until some
of the new terminals start to be produced might be
on the order of 18 months. It will probably be about
6 months until it has even been decided exactly what
features should be added (or are possible to add) and
the design finalized. A prototype of a new terminal is
nearing completion now under the direction of Jack Stifle.
   The major goal is to reduce the cost of the terminal,
however, not add new (and expensive) features. The current
type terminals will be used to complete the current system
at the 1000 terminal level...above comments assume both
the desire and funds for additional memory and computation
power to run more terminals will be forthcoming within
that time frame.

        Is there any finite reasoning in the present .75

        The advantages to a shortened pause lim. would
be many... animation, ability to "get" keys during
high output, etc...

If I remember correctly, one reason for not changing the
-pause- was that they simply couldn't time much more
accurately than .75 sec. A -pause- of .1 might make your
loop go more quickly, but the duration of the pause would
probably not be ".1", but rather "as soon as we get around
to it".

---------- response 2

I too thought we might be able to shorten that 0.75-sec
limit, but it turns out not to be feasible at the present
time. There is a fair amount of overhead involved with a
-pause-, overhead which cannot be fully accounted for in
limiting overall cpu usage. We do not have adequate cpu
power at present to handle such highly interactive key
processing. (Note that key-echoing at an -arrow- is much
simpler than processing keys at a -pause-, since with an
-arrow- no lesson material is accessed.)

  01/23     20.30     fuller       uimc

        Thanks, Bruce... a valiant effort nevertheless.
No, what a short pause would be good for is to be able to
"get" a key while you have a lot of output built up, ie:?
doto    1,temp1?1,2000
do      output $$ lots of output here
pause   .75,keys=whatever
goto    key=whatever,alter,x
1

if you build up .75 secs of output (easily done) the key
can be pressed and recognized, as the program will pause
for .75 while output is being sent. A straight output loop
simply cannot be made to always recognize a key pressed,
with the exception of -stop-, and even then -stop- causes
unpredictable results with only a branch key=stop or
similar... delay is not suitable because it does not
generate a true program stop, but forces the computer
to generate still more output, which causes a delay in the
display, but not the program itself...? Dave Fuller

I think this the current state of affairs...
  Fuller's example, immediately preceeding is in fact
  already accomplished by "catchup" since "pause .75"
  cannot be broken by any key, as, I assume, would be the
  case with "pause .2" if it were possible.
Perhaps what would be nice is:

time   .2 (currently limited to .75)
pause  keys=whatever
goto   key=whatever,stopit,x

or maybe a key that would break through a catchup??

Amidst the many water chiller crises, the ECS testing has
been going well--so well that unless something unforseen
happens this weekend, we will try to use all 2 million words
of ECS on Monday!

This good news is mostly the result of the exceptional
efforts of Larry Crotser, our CDC engineer, and others sent
by CDC to assist him. Thanks, Larry.

For the first day, we will just increase all allotments
by some percentage. After that we will calculate the new
permanent allotments and create the new logical sites that
have been requested. Anyone who wants to leave the logical
site he is in should send a note to me.

I'm sure that we have all heard the suggestion to make
variables referencable by the names in the define set
but of course all defines are lost at condense time.
Well all except the -student- define set......
which would lead one to suspect that the information
about a symbol's location is kept in a redily available
buffer or table for the judger to scoop up and utilize
in one timeslice... soooooo why not have the defined
names list with the variables and/or make the -student-
defined vars referencable at the inspect arrow at least
via -varloc-. This information HAS to be redily available.

When you want to debug your program just rename the define
set -student- and phhhhhooommm greater ease and efficiency
in debugging TUTOR programs! Then after finding where
that character string was really floating, you just rename

i.e. if i could see the directory of the course being

more than one record at once

2. not expecting to see that happen too soon , how about
fixing the copy option so i don't have to retype the course
every time. Currently , after copying a record, if i hit
shift-erase , and type in another name, it says
"no such record". If i press next and retype the course
name then all is well .If i didn't have to retype the
course name that would be a big help

I am in favor of the proposal, myself. There are many times
when the status of PLATO would be a good thing to find.
Suggestion, if it ever happens: switch the lines from
terminal operation to a recorded message when the system
goes down, so that calling a given rolling line and hearing
!beeeeeeeeeeeeep" means PLATO is up.
But the only people with the money to pay for such a line
that CERL comes in contact with, is NSF or the U of I

The message can be displayed if the computer itself is
working, but PLATO cannot be run for some reason. There
are many circumstances when the computer IS partially
working, but unable to run something like the program
which sends those messages.

Time betweeen PLATO's is apparently not a problem -- we

It works the same as if two people with proper change codes
try to edit simultaneously -- you get the "already being
edited by" message. And if the lesson is being edited when
you try to copy, you find you cannot. This is easy to test!
The problem has been stated previously -- it was far too
easy to copy what you thought was, say, a charset while
another person was in the process of destroying it and
making a common or micro block or something.

---------- response 2
  01/26     21.39     bowery       comm

  Further the problem is not a "deep" system problem.
It merely has to do with the limitations on disc accesses
and the time it takes to multiple block copy.

  The only soloution would be to get some sort of
revoloutionary form of mass storage with a virtually
nonlimited frequency and speed of access.

---------- response 3
  01/26     23.55     blomme       s

   We must "hold" onto the file being copied from to
prevent changes to it during the block copy option (to stop
certain experimenters from "testing" the system by copying
in garbage for charsets, micros, etc.). To let someone
who does NOT have the right to change a lesson tie it
up and prevent its being edited by its rightful owner seemed
a poor choice--hence the (consistent) requirement for
having the change code. So when you are copying from
some lesson it will appear to anyone else trying to edit
that lesson that you are already editing it and only
"inspect only" access will be permitted until your copying
is complete.
   Other (more complicated) schemes are possible to
prevent the potential disasters threatened by the old way,
but an immediate reliable solution was needed. It is
true that we still should have more complete integrity
checks on charset, micro, etc. data.

  To correct my previous comment:
The only way that the problem could be solved via the
'mass storage' I refered to would be to have any logical
sequence of copy operations done uninterrupted (ie. one
timeslice). This, of course, is the deranged
vision of some psychotic IBM system-killer.

   Answer to last question: not ever exactly simultaneously
but microsecond type close...this WILL be part of the
problems involved once we use more than one processor at a
time to execute TUTOR code. Currently one of our two CPU's
is dedicated to executing (with any spare time released
for other jobs) while the other is used for condensing,
formating, framing, system monitor calls, background jobs,
etc. Several operations already require write lockout
type protection to prevent the same word from being
changed by the two processors at the same time.

Today's ECS allocations are temporary.

In my last ecs report I said that the ECS was doing well.
Indeed it was, but since then,we suffered two cooling
failures. On Friday night, the room air conditioning failed
causing a rise in temperature and a very serious rise in
humidity. Last night the water cooling failed causing a
rapid rise in temperature. In both cases the computer
turned off. Such events almost always cause ECS problems.

As a result, we are now in the position we tried so hard
to avoid: we must run during prime-time on ECS which is
known to be unreliable. This may mean several days of
frequent very short interruptions. It already cost us an
hour and a half this morning.

If you use restart commands in your lessons, autocheckpoint
should reduce the loss to your students to an average of
only 4 minutes.

        Incredible Experience Department:

        During the last two major crashes (it's getting hard
to keep count), I have had a most interesting experience.
Both times, while the system was still apparently down, my
terminal became slaved to someone else's. Saw someone
editing a lesson called "paper," among others. Both times
the person did exactly the same things, as though I were
watching a taped replay. My keyset was locked out and I
could not talk to the editor, and, of course, my terminal
was not signed on at the time. After about ten minutes of
this, the screen blanked. Several minutes later, the system
came back up.

        Has anyone else seen this?

  Yes, the engineers are working on a means to play
taped messages through the NIU without needing the main
computer to be running at all. You were seeing some
recorded output that they were sending for test purposes.
Hopefully we will eventually have some minimal means of
communicating with users when there are system difficulties
and the main machine is down (but we still have electrical
power here in the building and the NIU is still operational)

We have experienced difficulty fitting in the added

weekday morning, a total of 7.5 hours per week. Our

We should like, therefore, to here your opinion of a change
in preventive maintenance time to 6:00 to 8:00 am on Monday,

the new maintenance time would seriously cripple us here
at aberdeen. our work day begins at 0730 est, 0630 cst.
this would mean that any of our students who are scheduled
for cai would lose 1 ˆ1=-=?2 hours out of the 8 hour day. since
they are in a self-paced course, with each lesson dependent
upon the previous lesson, it is impossible to "schedule
around" this lost time. we have been desperately trying to
save 10: of the training time. we could hardly afford to
lose 12ˆ1=-=?2: because of maintenance. since no classes
are on the system in the wee hours, why cannot the mainten-
ance time merely be performed earlier?

We should like to do maintenance in the middle of the night,

they can not work during the day. We need them here or else

the elementary math group would prefer the 5:30 -- 7:30
schedule . . .

maybe this would help some of the other morning users also

this would give us a half-hour to check things out
before the kids come rushing at the terminals at 8:00

with no break between the minute the system comes up
and the minute the kids start running
we don't have a chance to catch any small problems
and make any adjustments that didn't get done the
night before

also , if the system doesn't come up exactly on time,
we are losing scheduled class time. If it is scheduled to
come up at 7:30 and it is a few minutes late , no harm
will be done.

Something rather interesting about the micro editor.....

When going into a micro block in INSPECT ONLY mode,
it says "Press the key you want to set a micro for."
Pressing a key prints out "Here is the old micro..." and
then displays the micro. Now comes the fun part.
The only keys active there are NEXT and TERM. Pressing
NEXT clears the screen and prints the single word FONT.
Pressing FONT clears the screen. FONT again replaces the
word FONT. Pressing a letter prints out "Here is the old
micro..." and, I guess, the alternate font micro. Pressing
NEXT then displays the entire micro block. Other active
keys (instead of FONT and/or a letter) are BACK, DATA,
and STOP1. DATA returns you to the "press a key..." page,
DATA and STOP1 return you to the lesson index.

     I have complaint about negative zeros.(ie. a 0

     0). An n variable was being set to neg. zero in
     some cases and when this n variable was assigned

     the segmented variable equalled 1023(ten 1's)
     instead of 0(ten 0's).?
     It took me a long time to figure this out since
     I never expected to see a neg. zero. It seems to

   All arithmetic on this machine is 1's complement, as
far as the hardware is concerned, -0 and +0 are identical.
How tutor handles this I don't  know, but test and branch
instructions treat -0 as a negative number (bit 59=1) and
-0 < +0.

---------- response 2
  01/29     00.45     blomme       s

   It is fairly hard to generate a -0...the arithmetic
is done by the machine in such a way that most results
are +0 (for example, the ONLY two numbers you can ADD to
produce -0 are -0 and -0!) Obviously -0 will be most
unwelcome when looked at bitwise. If you have a special
operation which DOES generate -0, then all I can suggest
is that you simply add 0 to that result. This will have
only the effect of converting a -0 result to +0.
   Such a procedure should only rarely be required and is
not something that the "average" user should have any
concern about.

I, too, agree that musak was great. However, I walked in

Problem was I had no idea when it went down. Therefore,
would it be possible to say when the system went down?

The knowledge of these two times would benefit students very
much in making judgements as to stay or not. Likewise it
would help authors and administrators in dealing with

        when the display says that the system will
        be up in 1/2 hour, it actually means that
        it will be more than 1/2 hour or else they

Sounds like the lesson you visited put your course
name in n1, which (if I remember some recent notes on
the subject) is where the arrow structure on the
AUTHOR MODE page looks for the lesson name you want
if only -NEXT- is pressed.

        Yes, one of the lessons that leaves your course
in n1 is search. Any lesson that puts a name in n1
and does a jumpout with no tag then you wind up at the
author mode page, with the ability to press next to go
to that lesson.

in the new data editor, blocks h and i in

       the directory, but evidently have no recognizable

       in addition, although the datafile editor (as of
       this writing) does not find any outputl's, a readl
       command does (after a lengthy pause).
       unfortunately, except for the length (13) and the

I also got two garbage outputl's in comdata. It looked
like some area data had gotten scrambled royally. When I
searched for both of the students whose names appeared in
the outputl, the datafile editor was unable to pick up
the outputl. I assumed that these two items (which were
not together) had just been scrambled by the various
system problems of the past 10 days. (Unfortunately, I
had to reinitialize the file.)

Interesting little artifact about -TERM- "calc" that
Haken of Uni discovered: Put a student in a lesson.
Have him do a _TERM_ "calc". Now, recondense that
very lesson. The student then gets the expression he
typed in evaluated (apparently the STOP1 press from the
system does this), but does NOT leave the lesson.
*
You enter the lesson normally. The student still sees
his display, until he presses -NEXT-. Then he sees
the "memory allocation exceeded" error page in the
router (if one has been provided). This, of course,
is where a "lesson deleted" takes you. We haven't
determined yet whether finish unit is done or not.
Probably not. P.S. This is repeatable, Haken and I
did it twice now.

Often when I need to change part of a write statement
(about 5 full lines long) I end up having to re-type the
entire text. While it is quite easy to edit a single line
in the editor, it is hard to move words from one line to
another to get all the lines of approximately the same
length.
  Would it be possible to put an option in the editor that
would justify the text, after I have added or deleted words?
I am not concerned with exactly equal length lines, nor
splitting words.....

        1) Go to condense lesson, at 5 before the hour,
        forgetting that students are to use it at the hour.

        2) The condense cue is long, because of a heavy
        student load, and the fact your priority is shot.
        It says "65 of 65", and you go to get a coke.

        in the old version, still condensed,
        and start their test.

To all the nice people at Magnavox ¬+ Sysprog....

Having worked with PLATO for almost two years now. I think
it is high time to congratulate all the fine poeple that
I've come in contact with, as well as those we never see
but are always there, catering to everyones wishes.

I have never worked with a better computer system.

But it seems to me that a great added feature could be
added in the far distant future (perhaps PLATO V) by making
these terminals "smart". That is to say, allowing 'local'
operation with the capability of storing data on a cassette
tape (while PLATO is down), which could be loaded into a
lesson when PLATO is up.

What kind of "data" were you thinking of? Editing?
Editing seems very unlikely.

On the other hand, people now run experiments and collect
data with, say a PDP-11, and then at night-time pour all
their data into PLATO via the external jack so that they
can analyze it and make pretty graphs.

---------- response 2

I have two comments.
   1. The request for some means to store information in
      the "advanced terminal" for later insertion into a
      PLATO lesson seems to be impossible to me unless you
      are expecting a terminal to have copies of your
      lesson _and_ the editor for making changes. If your
      intent is to store data for use in student mode, you
      would have to correctly enter all keypresses without
      feedback to allow later correct execution.

      Not likely.

  2. (unrequested information) You can already store
     information from a lesson when PLATO is up to use
     as a backup when PLATO is down. However, what see is
     what you got the first time when the recording was
     made. Obviously no keyboard input would be accepted.

---------- response 3
  01/31     11.21     educ30       ames

This is what I had in mind:

Suppose you had a block or two of programming to put in
your lesson. Presently, this means loggin in (if PLATO

With a smart terminal, you could either store programming
using a tape while the system is down-- or, situations of
tight ECS (not likely for a while w/new ECS), you could
store it on 'local'.
Then, when systems is up, simply load program into your
lesson in a few seconds.
If we all had a PDP handy that we could hook up to PLATO,
I am sure that would solve everyone's problems....

Rather than worry about elaborate things to do when the

the PLATO staff to concentrate on keeping the system

There is currently much experimentation with versions of
a new, "smart" terminal, such as the "Intelligent Terminal"
we are testing in the research lab. The basic setup is a
pdp-11 connected to an experimental plasma panel and various
peripheral equipment, a PLATO line included. The amount of
"intelligence" inherent in such a setup is, of course,
dependent on who is programming it. Storage and retrieval
of information is but one area in which work is progressing.

There is, also, some work being done on a terminal with an
Intel microprocessor in control. I'm afraid I can't give
you much information on that.

One thing to remember is that NOTHING is impossible or
unlikely. It might take a few years, but.....

As for storing material on tape when PLATO is down...
if you have a multiplexer, you too can have bags

The line back to plato from the terminal is too slow

   The terminals of the future will indeed be "smarter"
but not in the sense of running programs and letting you
edit--the current bottleneck is indeed the "data path"
(a phone line) to the main computer and the files and the
data storage. Terminals will be improved to take simple
commands and generate complex graphics on their own--like
sending the co-ordinates of the center and the radius of
a circle and having the terminal compute and output the
proper points (currently circles are made up out of
line segments computed and sent by the main computer).
   Keeping copies of data both centrally and locally is
not in our plans. As others have pointed out, you can
elect to send selected data through the ext command (at
a rather slow rate). Our emphasis will remain on building
an extremely flexible and powerful central system.

  As far as a smart terminal goes, I have found that
they are not too well appreciated by the system staff
that the term is on, so it is my feeling even if a
"smart" terminal was fesialbe on PLATO, that it wouldn't
stay on the system very long....
P. S. every system staff gives different reasons against
the "smart" terminals. none of them are very good!

 Is an intelligent terminal (or a ditributed processing
network) going to save you enough in terms of communications
cost to justify the increase (hopefully not) cost of an
intellignet terminal, plus, you will save some in terms of
central site hardware (less processing necessary), but how
much? Plato seems to be built around the idea of a very
powerful central computer, with little or no remote
computing power, which seems resonable considering that a
teacher should not have to worry about computers at the
local level - that's what the people at the central site
are for. There is a great advantage in a 'smart' terminal
with local graphics generators (less data transmitted from
central site = lower data rates = lower cost) and somewhere
in between is the tradeoff.

     The problem noted in HELP note 400 has been found
and fixed. The problem was where commons were getting
shifted one word or so.
     Paraphrasing Dave Frankel, the bug was in the
Side Door Adapter, the device that lets the discs and
ECS communicate without going through central memory.
The fix was, (get this), to make a wire 20 inches longer 
than it was previously!
     The commons affected, not too many of them, will not
fix themselves spontaneously. If you would like the
backup copy of your lesson so that you can recover the
common, contact Maureen Hoffman (maureen of p).

Thanks to dave andersen for adding the "unit" search

In case you haven't thought about it, this search on
selected unit(s) enables you (usually, depending upon
how you program -arrow-ˆs within -unit-ˆs) to see, in one
place, all the student answers to an individual arrow.

A suggestion for the writers of the options page;
At present, in the lesson editor, Q is the key which
takes you to aids. However, in author mode, on the
options page and elsewhere, Shift-A takes you to
aids. Can you switch things so that Shift-Q
(presently unused) will take you to aids from
author mode?
The transfer will leave Shift-A unused. I suggest
that Shift-A be reset to take users to lesson alarm.
That is a systems lesson, and very useful to most
authors due to the hypnotic qualities of the system.
If these changes are going to be made, the sooner the
better, to allow fingers to retrain themselves.

it is necessary to know just exactly what kind of condition
occurred... _+_ infinity, or _+_ indefinite. They occur as the

a lesson for 20 min....to find that no data on her
performance was recorded in the datafile...pmalsdata...
While she was still looking at the course...
I used barb of pmals...to briefly enter and leave a lesson.
A block of data was added to pmalsdata...but it contained
data as early as 1/06/75....while the block said 2/03/75
Also...while block b was listed...no data is given...
        Backing out to EDIT page...and reentering pmalsdata
cleared up ...and brought in new data for block c...
containing "barb's" data....but no data is yet available
in block b...
        Any explanations....
Further info on request......thanks, barb

Many datafiles were screwed up slightly during the

When you re-initialize the file the problems will go

This package is used to transfer area data from your data-

making necessary changes. I'm sure that the students would
apprieciate this option as well as the authors. I know that
this can be done through course records, but most of the

The problem you may be having is that when it does a showa
on a segmented variable, it actually -showa-s a single word
with the segmented variable right-justified in it. Thus
there will always be a certain number of null chars in
front of the things, and you have to take these into account
when computing the length.

By "null char" I meant an octal 00, which doesn't show.
If you define, say,
        segment,vertical,seg=n1,25,12
and set seg(1) to "ab", then n1 will contain (in octal)
        000000000102000000
but the expression -seg(1)- has the octal value
        00000000000000000102
now, a showa of length 2 on this will only show
the first 12 bits, WHICH ARE ALL ZERO, or invisible.
A showa of length 9 shows the letter a.
A showa of length 10 shows the letter a.

I did try it, though, and it worked.
At least, it worked if you remember that it doesn't quite
work the way one thinks it will.
To showa the first N chars of a segment of length M chars
(vertical or otherwise) you do a showa with a length tag
of 10-MN. Of course, this assumes that N<+m, and it
also assumes that the each segment contains a whole number
of characters, since otherwise things get very messy.
Note that this is irrespective of vertical or horizontal
segment-ness, and a showa with segmented variables of length
>10 causes an execution error.

Keep in mind that there is no local echoing of
characters, so that when you monitor someone,
what you type is sent back from the computer to
both you and him. In addition, the computer has
to send _all_ his output to your terminal as well.
At the same time, the computer is processing
several hundred other people.

most cases I am monitoring, the only output coming to the

the output speed of the terminal (and certainly not enough
to fill the output buffer).

    Sorry, but you don't understand. What Mike asked for
was the position of the last -at-, not the last position
plotted.
     For example:
at    1010
write 0123456789
show  where
show  there

     One would get 1020 for the -where-, but 1010 for
-there-. Thinking it over, it wouldnt be useful in -rdraw-s
because -where- already serves that function. However, I
have often wanted something to tell me where the -rdraw-
left off.

  A strange thing just happened while I was in Red
Gulch waiting for PLATO to make the final move of the
game. PLATO was in Santa Fe (position so) and thus
needed to get either 10 or 20. His numbers came up
as +1, +4, and +5 and he (very calmly) combined them
in such a manner as to get 19 as follows:
(+4)(+5) - 1 = 19. Therfore, since I was already
at Red Gulch, i was quickly acclaimed the WINNER
which I accepted with great humility!

     You should note that, of course, PLATO could have
tied the game by combining the numbers as follows;

Let's not get into another game controversy, but I see no
reason why not to restrict high-ECS-using games to after
primetime, because the system is so much slower when usage
is higher. When the system is slow it takes forever to get
anything done. Reading NOTES even becomes a chore. You
can never get though them. When working on your lesson, and
you try to condense it you never know if you'll get there.
On top of that, you have trouble getting back to the author
mode page.
    So, even though I usually side with the with the
pro-game people, I dont think these games should be put on
primetime.

  The question of redundant computation on the system is
a more rational way of dealing with the REAL problem than
making a neurotic attack on some symbolic organism
called 'games'. It seems to be a matter of system
engineering to utilize the available resources profitably
and avoid a similar tragedy such as the nation's
economy is now experiencing. (it: resources there....
 just not communication)

 In other words.. get rid of lousy lessons and programs

Redundant computation and idle time are not.

Evolutionary which at a what??
Another opinion: When questioning the relative importance/
unimportance of any one lesson or group of lessons, recall
the REAL purpose of a "lesson, -- something to instruct, or
help; or, because this is an important part of education,
to entertain. I think no one could _reasonably_ argue for
something which taxes the system at the student's expense;
nor can we simply group an entire category of lessons into
the (somewhat overworked) status of "game". You can almost
always find the same people saying the same things every
time this comes up -- one faction which is here to play, and
another which is (sometimes unsuccessfully) attempting to
run large classrooms of students on what was until recently
a VERY tight system; and a third group which basically
doesn't give two **** about the whole subject.
?which ones scream loudest?

 I agree with you all, but when the system is being used
heavily say for example during the daylight hours, the CPU
is much to slow for it to work well, true the system does
kick the highest offenders out first, but untill tehn you
slow up processing for everyone else. And think about this
for awhile, what would happen to the sites (165), if most
of the authors were playing games and some student was trying
to get a lesson done say for accounting, shhessh can you
imagine it, just like a zoo. the student would end up
leaving or better yet, driven out of the place where he
wanted to work!!

The way that room 165 is handled currently should be
satisfying everyone.....I would like to applaud Mike Berger
for his statement about the ECS. Things are just great
right now, but the PLATO system will keep expanding and
expanding, so the huge allocations won't be here forever...
Things should be handled about the same way they were
before the new ECS came in....

        Some games are obvious. Some simulations that
        are present are arguable as to whether they are
        games of not. Some lessons are not designed to
        teach?help. Some lessons are designed to
        communicate(talko) or to number crunch (calc).
        Opinion: Games ( the ones that are REAL games)
        should be forbidden till the user list has gone
        down to say 150 to 200. And only after prime
        time. ECS is plentiful, yet it wont be here
        to stay. I say let us use the same precautions

Sorry my last statment was so ambiguous. What I meant
by 'evoloutionary' selection was this:
  People generally like things that they like and don't
like things they don't like. In general ther are lesson
that are well received either for their educational
value or for their entertainment value. An evoloutionary
system would involve acurate feed-back between the user
community and the supplier of this 'utility' such that
actions which tended to produce 'functional' processes
would be encouraged at ALL levels.

  SELECT those scheduals of reenforcments which tend
to produce the most positive reaction in AVERAGE user,
not just some specialized group.

Definitely an interesting theroy. Unfortunately, what the
"average" user thinks doesn't really carry a lot of weight
unless that "average" user (you and I, right?) happens to
have a lot of time, effort, and money sunk into running
PLATO, and has control of a set of terminals which he/she
can control. Evolutionary Selection would be a fantastic
way to run this system if each of us bought our own ter-

in chess 3.5 or whatever.....

we get...
        Theorem 2: what the hell's a group, anyway?
Referring to 1, there is no such thing as a group, either
games, people, terminals, gamenames, coke machines

A "group", according to Set Theory, is a collection of
objects, a defined operation on these objects, and an
"Identity Element" such that certain laws hold true.
These laws are:

        Given a group (G,?) (meaning G is a set, and ? is
an operation) with identity element I and element a;

        I ? a = a for all a.

        For each element a of G, there exists another ele-
ment aˆ-ˆ1 (called an inverse) such that

        a ? aˆ-ˆ1 = I for all a.

(continued....)

---------- response 22
  02/06     16.17     frye       research

Now, let's extend the mathematical definition of "group" to
our reality-bound vision of the people around us:

Each group (G, interaction) has a " driving force" referred
to as its Identity.

Each person (ekement) of this group should, when related to
the group's Identity, remain unchanged.

For each person in the group, there should exist a "counter-
part" who, when interacting with the first person, reflects
the basic Identity of the group.

It is possible for one person to be considered a group,
provided he/she be able to control him/herself to the
extent that his Identity is not threatened. It is when
this "oriving force" is wiped out that the group will be
destroyed.

        I partially agree with Mr. Fuller. But any
        group ( after a given amount of time ) breaks
        down, changes, or regroups with another to
        for a different group. This is basically
        true for a system, but in a different way.
        Systems (hierarchies for example) get stale
        and non functional. In other words they
        become incompetent (read the Peter Principle).
        No one can say that there isnt a given amount
        of incompetence in this system(or systems).
        There is a given amount of incompetence in
        any system, The whole key is: weed out

that have done the student any good. Why??. because games
are a good approach to a lesson, maybe the university would
never accept a semester of games of a grade in say, physics

fact that learning must be fun, not a drag as it is now

Currently, if one gets a "fatal condense error", he is
thrown to the dreaded "Call Your Instructor" page, from
which there is no return (AND I MEAN _NO_ RETURN) except
by pressing some mundane key like stop1, next, or back,
and typing in the name of the lesson again. This is very
painful, especially when one has done something like
mispelling the name of one's common, or forgetting to type
in the correct jumpout code. It seems kinda ridiculous
to be separated completely from the lesson just because
one's error is particularly drastic. Is there any hope
for getting this rather trivial thing changed?

CLOSE shutter?????? Not according to AIDS, from what I

and all closed the shutter with any of the bit-10-on-and-

until the advent of the shutter, which makes an audible
click, tou could silently turn a slide off by doing
-slide n$union$512-. it's still more silent to do that
than to say -slide 512- which sends the carriage back to 0.

---------- response 2
  02/05     09.33     bowery       comm
  Well, maybe the point is this:
In AIDS I read that if the value of the tag on the
slide command had a bit off at position 9 the shutter
would be open. In the 512-767 range you refer to
the octal values range from 01000 to 01377 all of which
have a 0 9ˆtˆh place bianary digit. Under. these constraints
the shutter should be OPEN.
  By the way, why would n$union$512 behave any differently
than 512 or 512+n where n is 0 in so far as output is
concerned? Just curious.

---------- response 3
  02/05     12.25     john r       reading

As to AIDS write-up, I don't know enough to comment.

Reason for $union$: if the slide number is stored in a
variable, the union will give me the needed bit regardless
of the state of the variable. 512+n won't work if the
variable was already, by error, in the 512 to 737 range.

And its the age old problem of whether the bit representing

to use the somewhat standard 9?ˆth?? convention, the point
should probably be made more explicit.

Seminar Notice:

George Carter, Monday February 10. 1975, 4pm

115 Digital Computer Laboratory

  This general discussion will focus principally on
Computer-based Conferencing, the use of interactive
computer terminals as a communications medium. An
advanced conferencing system developed on PLATO will
be described.
  This is a good opportunity for those curious about
what this rather unique research group does.
  Those wishing to be on our mailing list should sent
me a personal note.

  Weird thing happened to me as i tried to edit a block
in one of my stable lessons. Well see i came into my lesson
expecting to be able to change the name of one of my blocks
without retribution from the system.. Ah but such was to
to be my fate! Yes the editor knew from the typo errors
and varying rate of key input that it was I. SO when
i changed the name and backed out... well it was
*poof* GONE!!! dead!!!(the block) oh well such is the fate
of a belaboured author.
(Yes thats ALL i did in the block.. press lab, some keys
and back off)

It still happens. On occasion - maybe 5: of the time - I
can press shift-stop upon exit from the router to a routed
lesson and find myself back under router control in the
end-lesson unit. I have no way of knowing, of course,
whether I actually get to the top of the routed lesson
or whether I am still en route when the stop1 is done.

I'd appreciate a _systems_ comment as to whether this is a
known bug and as to whether you really want such reports
as these to continue to be made.

Would there be any objection to making 1/0 match the
maximum tag in a conditional expression? There is often
a need for a ridiculously large value in certain algorithms,
and 1/0 would fit the bill perfectly if it were not for this
one drawback. Also, it would seem logical to think of 1/0
as being larger than 0...

---------- response 1
  02/06     16.02     r hedin       matha

  well, since nobody else responded--
  I think it would be more natural to have 1/0 be considered
a very large number by the logical operations machinery.
The more the language behaves in the way people intuitively
expect. the less business the pso people will have.
  But it's not a major concern (sorry, RS).

I agree with Hedin's remark that the language should
behave on the way people intuitively expect.
In particular, 0/0 and 1/0 should not be treated as
ordinary real numbers.

The present leslist editor which is available from the
block directory page, for editing leslists, is just about
worthless. In any application that requires large use
of leslists, the author places the numbers of the jump
lessons in common, or in source in his block, where they
cannot be changed in the leslist editor. But the editor
is so arranged that it is impossible to change a single
"slot" in the leslist without elaborate addition and
deletion to fill up all slots before the desired one with
certified unique dummy lesson names. This is intolerable,
especially since almost everyone is writing his own
leslist editor.
Come on, guys. get on the ball over there!

---------- response 1
  02/06     12.02     fuller       uimc

      A few observations:

      1) Since the leslist editor presently uses
just plain leslist commands (and can really cause problems
to the unwary/unknowing) I can't see any gains by the
system writing an improved editor, especially when you
can write one yourself that does just the same thing...?
      2) I have seen many leslist editors on the
system, and none of them seem to do the same thing (like
common editors). Who is to make the decision on what should
be included?
      3) Until the gross problems that the present
editor is capable of creating are corrected, on whatever
level, I can't see anything being done...

I don' know if it will solve any of the mentioned problems,
but you may take a copy of block "ieditor" out of lesson
"plib". But it is designed for inst. files - not just

Rather than blow off steam at a diatribe on the ssytems
staff, I took action.
A better leslist editor, that allows editing of specific
spots in the leslist, is in lesson willcount. It is
copyable to your own lessons, and can use any leslist
for which the lesson code either matches or is blank.
This editor should soon be in lesson library: meanwhile,
anyone who wants a copy is free to take what he needs
(by the S-IS route) from lesson willcount, block n.

  I think the problem is that prime time has been
miss defined by connctations from the fact that games
are not allowed during it. Prime time is NOT a function
of when games are(n't) to be run. The system staff
probably dreeams of the day when prime time is 24 hours
a day! That is the direction PLATO is heading or at
least the point where it will have 'arrived'..ie: be
purely marketable rather than experimental.
  The stated purpose of this system is NOT for games
or number crunching or high-brow computation. These
things have been given, therefore, a time slot where
the use of PLATO is not commercially viable.
i.e: during experimental system programming.

In the curriculum editor, it is possible to

the same description each time or with different
descriptions each time.. There seems to no longer
be a check as to whether or not the lesson already
exists in the instructor file or not.. This has
resulted in duplicate lesson names all over and just
a big general mess..

A Suggestion to Whoever has control on the Varian Copier.

I think we need a reservation system to use the varian
copier. Sometimes one has to wait for two hours to
get on the copier. If i have a large amount of work
to do, I have to make some apologetic remarks to
others every five minutes for monopolizing the machine.
A lot of time will be savedfor the varian users
if we have a simple lesson in which one can sign up
for a certain time period in advance. Of course the
system can make permanent reservation of a chunk of
time for their use or maintenance or even for
'no servation period' during which first -come -first-
served will prevail. Although I understand that one
more copier is scheduled to be intalled, the reservation
system will still be good.You will understand me
if you ever tried to use the machine.

---------- response 1

i would like to see a time limit on use (like 5 minutes)
during the day. in the evening, the large users can then
use big chucks of time, of course, if noone wants to
use the copier, it could be used by one person for more
than 5 minutes. it is very frustrating for us short
user to want _one_ copy ¬? have to wait 2 hours for it.

It was the custom for users who were going to be on for more
than a few minutes to stop now and then to let people who
wanted a copy or two to use the copier. That simple countesy
can take the place of a lot of rules and red tape.

Also, are you really doing the right thing if what you are
doing regularly calls for using the copier for a couple of
hours?

---------- response 3
  02/06     17.48     silver       ve

To anser the last question: I think there are cir-
cumstances when one would like to take a long time. Maybe
not several hours. Many lessons can be documented in vari-
ous ways using the copier; many of these were written before
the copier was available. Thus, a backlog.
As for the schedule lesson, it does sound like a good idea,
especially for folks who are making a special trip to cerl
to use the copier.

Perhaps simpler than a scheduling lesson would be a

for 1 and 2-page jobs..... Say, from the hour until
10 minutes after the hour. That would give the long
jobbers a little break, too!

When writing loops which use a lot of CPU, I sometimes
include something like the following so one can check
whether the lesson is still crunching, or the lesson is
stuck (infinite loop, dead system, etc.):?
1if branch (key=data),x,1f1
write ¬0at,510¬1¬0t,n1¬1 $$ n1 is, for example, a loop counter
1fi?
Problem: when in background mode, pressing the data key has
no effect. (However, in foreground mode, the key will always
"break through".)?
Question: will this behavior always be characteristic of
background mode, or is this a transient phenomena which will
go away when the system has had more experience in handling
a large number of terminals??
P. S. If it makes any difference, the time of day was
       10:00 am (i.e. probably a relatively heavy load on

i have several backgnd programs that use such a key check
¬+ wrote a tight backgnd loop to test this, ¬+. you can catch
the value of -key-; w/programs w/a lot of output it may take

if there is a "backlog" of output at that time

You may find you have better luck using -STOP- instead of

constrained if you are creating screen output in your loop.

I believe the point here is that he is in a loop where
there a lot of crunch but not much pretty -- output is
not the problem, it's that the key is somehow getting
lost. I've had the same problem. and never found a
reasonable way to circumvent it.

  Would some one please correct these things as they are

1. Make stop and/or stop1 available to stop listing in
   all system editing lessons and inspection lessons.
   Also in SD where one might have more output specified
   than he needs or he may need to get somewhere else
   in a hurry stop1 and or stop would be of benifit to
   stop and exit interpretation (auto-break really hurts
   here). I realize there are places where these keys may
   not be practical to implement: branch key-stop,x,1out,x
2. Either make -varloc- act as a function at an arrow

The place where STOP really hurts is when trying to zip
thru a course roster and pressing stop after the name
and hours (or anything at the top) is plotted only
to have the whole name plotted again..
   Its just that I dont want to see the other
stuff and dont want to plot it either...

  I think something is very screwy with the defines around
here. I defined " absmax=n9", and tried to do a -store- on
it. Got formok=4--whatever that means since the change.
When I make _only_ the change to "nabsmax=n9", all is well!
I first noticed this last night, but I counted it off as
yet another non-prime time wierdity.

absmax = abs(max) -- do you have a variable named max ??
A similar problem arises when one defines the hyperbolic
functions as sinh(z) =(exp(z)-exp(-z))/2.
If there is a variable named h then the compiler takes
sinh(x) to mean sin( h?x ). Very frustrating!?
The only solution I know is to change the define.

  There is no variable named max. This is confirmed not
just by my memory, but by a search for "max=".
  Try it in your own lesson.

---------- response 3
  02/07     20.00     bowery       comm
  The problem is that he DOESNT have a variable named
"max". formok=4 ¬) unrecongnized variable name because
in the expression absmax (=abs(max)) max was not defined.
That this was not flagged with a condense error or warning
is a problem with the define tables created since they
cant check for all the possible combinations of functions
and chars. The same thing will happen (I predict) if you
say Nmax where N is some function and max is not defined.

(by the way.. this IS dealing with a student define set
as r heidin pointed out to me)

1) If you press E as an author, the display dutifully
reports the amount of ECS being used.

2) Now sign on as an instructor. The display reports
that 0 ECS is being used.

Dear Plato,
 For my birthday I would like:

1) a reserved word *lsiten* which returns the logical site
   number (the same one listed on E option).This would be
   useful for controling access by logical sites.It would
   save me a lot of space (64?18it<<64 words).

2) -ext- restriction by station instead of by signon.
   (Make it toggleable by authors at the station or in site.)

 Most external devices that need to be ext'ed remotely
 are in a fixed location.Many of these devices are/(were
 before restrictions) beepers that are used to inform
 someone who isn't at the terminal/(signed on) to return
 to the terminal.

Right. It would really be much easier when
it is needed to check for logical site than
to use a sitenam.

I'm more interested in the second request. It's
very difficult to use external hardware devices
now, unless one devotes a record to be signed into
a specific lesson. Since many external devices
are terminal-dependent, how about an option for
terminals not signed on to author records such
that one can toggle them to received externals.
It could default every time the student reaches
the welcome to plato page to "off" unless reset.

The announcement about -score- and *lscore* sounds very
interesting. Question: is this of any use in lessons that
don't use the system router? In our router, csrouter, we
want to keep similar information, and are using one nr
variable per lesson to do so; we accept up to two separate
numbers to store, which we call "grade" and "status".
The code to set these values, though, requires seiting
aside a known n-variable; conventions and code are in lesson
oslibrary. Is there any way we can make things simpler for
our router/routed lessons in this area, using the new
system feature? Or is it only useful with the system
router?

---------- response 1
  02/11     13.24     chabay       s

-score- and lscore can of course be used by any router.
In your case, it sounds as if having the reserved word
lscore available could save a variable, and simplify the
defines in your lessons slightly.

---------- response 1
  02/11     13.24     eland       csa

I was quite surprised to read that the lscore machinery can
be used by those not using the system router. As I recall,
the note introducing the feature seemed to imply that a
permanent copy of lscore would be made "...if you are using
the system router..." My assumption was that the lscore
would be kept in the router variables. Rowever, if I am
reading things right, this opens up some interesting
possibilities in the work we have done with computer science
student records.?
Just out of curiosity, where is the lscore data kept (some
of the previously unused area in the student bank?). Is
there any limit to the number of lessons for which a score
can be kept?

---------- response 3
  02/11     14.11     b sherwood       s

The -score- command sets a variable in the non-accessible
part of the student bank. The system router transfers
the contents of "lscore" to a router variable for keeping
track of scores in lessons. Any router could do the same.
When a student comes into the router from a lesson, just
place the contents of "lscore" in a router varible which
you associate with that particular lesson.

This note is designed to initiate an interactive tutorial
on the concept of "published lessons" before the concept
becomes a reality.

If you have not used lessons written by other authors in
a class, or had your lessons used by other instructors, you
may not be familiar with a basic problem. An author is
not using the lesson at the moment in his own class, so he
makes some drastic changes to the lesson. Your students
go into the lesson at a time when it is temporarily out of
order. Result: chaos. The basic point is that with your
own students you can control usage and make sure that your
own lessons are working. but when using others' lessons
you can get in trouble. Experimental use in the author's
own class doesn't require "publishing, the lesson, but for
class use by others a different sort of status for the
lesson is required.

---------- response 1
  02/11     13.19     b sherwood       s

We plan to institute a new lesson classification, that of
a "published" lesson, Published lessons would be listed in
an on-line catalog. where you would find information on the
title, author, description of the lesson, and some
indication of the amount of use-testing the lesson had
received in an actual class. An instructor could easily
pick an item out of the catalog to add to his own list
of lessons made available to his students.

A published lesson could not be edited by anyone! This
insured that it remains in working order and can be
depended on by instructors intending to use it in a real
class. The original author could get a copy of the lesson
to work on, then submit a revised version once it too had
been tested, but he would not edit the published lesson

Only lessons which have been tested with real students
will be eligible for inclusion in the catalog. This is
NOT intended to be an aid to authors who want to show a
department head that they have "published" something.
It is intended to be an aid to instructors who want to
have easy access to class-tested lesson materials, and a
means for authors to get their lessons used by people
other than themselves.

There will be certain legal ramifications to publishing a
lessons. Authors submitting a lesson to be published will
have to agree to a set of policy rules governing
dissemination of the materials. This document of agreement
has not yet been written, but the general outlines of the
policy can be sketched already. The main point is that,
in return for inclusion in the catalog and possible
royalties for use, the author would permit the University
to distribute the materials.

---------- response 3
  02/11     13.32     b sherwood       s

In particular. the University, acting as "literary agent"
for the author, would be empowered to negotiate with
outside organizations to supply lessons in return for
royalty payments. The author would have to affirm of
show that his lesson is his own work and does not infringe
any existing copyrights. (Some authors have temporary
releases from book publishers to use copyrighted materials
in their lessons, for experimental small-scale class use.
Such agreements would have to be extended before such
materials could be included in the PLATO catalog.)

Subject to further negotiation with Federal agencies, the
Board of Trustees has approved in principle a set of
rules which would return a portion of royalty income to
authors, with a portion retained by the University as
literary agent.

These are some of the considerations associated with
"published lessons". Comments?

        One: Does the author have the voice in
        who or where his lesson goes to or who
        uses it, and does he/she have a voice in
        the amount of royalties asked for. Can
        the author negotiate ahead of time (before
        the contract is signed) as to the portion
        of royalties that he/she is given?

  02/11     22.00     b sherwood       s
First: the author would have no voice in who could use
the lesson. This is the essence of "publishing". An
author does not control the marketing of a book--the
publisher may sell to anyone and would presumably be
subject to legal action from potential buyers if he
refused certain clients.

Second: it is proposed to keep the royalty rate simply.
Probably done by class of material, loosely correlated with
the going rate of education in that area (more for grad
law courses,less for elementary reading, on a per-hour
basis). In order to keep it all manageable, there should
normally be little negotiating on royalty rate, with this
determined normally by a standard schedule. The University
would take a percentage of gross royalties as its fee
for distribution and return the rest to the author and/or
institution. See next page for discussion of how royalties
would be split up.

---------- response 6
  02/11     22.22     b sherwood       s

Current thinking is that the University of Illinois would
keep 25: of GROSS royalties as "literary agent" and pass
75: to the author (or authors). If the author is at
a different institution, the 75: would go to the institution
and its own policies would govern how and whether the
author would share in this income. If the author has been
commissioned by the U. of Illionois to write the lesson and
been given released time to do it, then the added input
on the part of the University will entitle it to 60: of
gross royalties, and the author would receive 40:.
Notice that splitting gross income gives some insurance
that the University will act in the interests of authors,
since that also increases the income of the Literary
agent". Hopefuly the University would negotiate royalty
rates to maximize INCOME, whether thru large sales at low
costs or vice versa.

   1) Having negotiated with publishers, this royalty
percentage sounds most generous.
   2) Will list of non-published but still available
lessons (as in CERL Report X-41) still be available offline?
   3) Criteria for "publishing" must be closely examined
and agreed upon by author community as well as CERL.
   4) Strongly feel some sort of review by author peers
is necessary before lessons be "published". Not to
conform with establishment, but to check for outere
idiosyncracies or subtle errors in fact. After all,
bad programs will create public apathy toward PLATO.
Is there any way this can be done "painlessly"? Some
author groups are cooperating now, could serve as
review nucleus.

I agree with Don Shirer.....there should be some
review board for the published lessons...... not
just the fact that some students have gone through
the lesson several times. The review board could
be composed of several authors/instructors in the
same teaching area as the lessons. For one
would like to have someone besides students look and
comment on all of the lessons that I have. I would
also be very glad to serve on such a board.

What about the fact that there is considerable interchange

who find it useful? If some author uses code from someone
else's lesson (with their permission, of course) how will
this effect the copyright and the royalties? I hope not
adversely, since this would lead to a closed. highly

I think that "peer review" would be inappropriate so long
as the UI has an effective monopoly on the distribution
of PLATO lessons. Many good books and articles have
been rejected by a number of publishers before they found
a home. Until there are multiple out lets there is too much
chance that something good will be ruled out by a one chance
peer review process. One possibility would be an optional
know a given field could get together and give a " seal of
approval" to certain lessons; there could be rival review
groups in any given field, and some authors might choose to
publish without the seal of approval.

---------- response 12
  02/12     09.26     michael       english

I agree with Prof. Maggs: A review board of fellow
authors is too similar to the concept of the "papal seal"
which governs publishing of books by Roman Catholic
priests. I would assume that review boards constructed
somewhat like that behind the "Good Housekeeping" seal
of approval would form, but that this should not deter
anyone from "publishing" a lesson without it. Obviously,
lessons written under the auspices of large funded projects
should undergo their own review procedure.

What will be the policy on disk space in regard to this?
Will the lesson be copied and converted to a binary, or will
the system reclaim the lesson space also? Either way, I
think the concept of "group membership" is going to have to
be resolved, as it affects the concept of publishing a
lesson as well as disk space allocation. What if Group and
Author disagree?

I'll try to respond to the various comments:
1) Probably some kind of list of non-published materials
will have to exist to inform people that there are authors
working already in such areas. I think file names would
still be secret to protect work-in-progress and to prevent
instructors from depending on volatile lessons in actual
classes. Also, we want to put pressure on authors to
bring lessons up to a publishable level.
2) I agree with Maggs on review. Since there is only one
"printing press", we must not impose stringent review
procedures. We certainly can insist that the lesson
be free of gross errors such as execution errors. And we
can encourage people to write reviews of lessons, available
somewhere on and off the system.
3) Disk space for the uneditable copy will be swallowed by
the system in most cases.

4) Copyright is tricky and, I think , not sufficiently
worked out yet. (Peter Maggs, want to comment?) The author
is considered to "own" the work. The inner workings, the
actual TUTOR code used to achieve the effects, are protected
by an inspect security code. The external appearance of
the lesson MAY possibly be registerable under standard
federal copyright procedures. This might be done by
submitting the text of the -write- statments (the *list
text option in prints) together with phots of major
displays in the lesson. To my knowledge no one has yet in
fact submitted such materials to the Registrar of Copyright
to see whether it would be acceptable. (If the author was
commissioned by the University, it "owns" the lesson, but
the author gets royalties as described earlier.)

5) If you use coding from someone's lesson (with permission)
that will cerainly affect royaltise, in general. You
should make an agreement about shares in royalties at the
time of the transfer of the material. In most of the cases
with which I am personally acquainted it is adequate merely
to give an acknowledgement, with no share in possible
royalties. This is due to the fact that normally rather
small pieces of lessons are used, and any income share would
be too small to bother about, since a fair estimate of the
contribution might be 5: to 10: of the new lesson.

6) The University of Illinois will NOT pay royalties on
lessons created anywhere on the Urbana PLATO system and
used in classes on any of its three campuses. (It will of
course have to pay royalties on lessons written on other
PLATO systems and transferred here.) It will charge lesson
royalties for use in classes off-campus, using the Urbana
system, even if the lessons were created on the Urbana
system. This asymmetry may seem unfair, but the University
position is that it made and continues to make major
investments of both people and money in creating the first
PLATO system, and it will not pay royalties for the use of
lessons created on that system, no matter where created.

2) May lessons contain within themselves the names of

How does this fit into things? Specifically, would the
published lesson have the same name it had before
publication (in the absence of a deliberate name change,

1) If a published lesson refers to another lesson. as with
-use-, -charset-, -jumpout-, etc., those lessons also must
be published. Presumably the names would stay the same;
that is, the lesson would still contain "charset zap,blk",
even tho file "zap" is not the published version of file
"zap". The condensor would have to recognize that "zap"
really refers to P-zap (published version of lesson "zap").
On the other hand, published lessons would not be accessed
by name, neither to edit (which is not allowed) nor to
study. Rather, you would look at the on-line catalog and
pick "that one".
2) Any transfer of lessons to other systems would, in
return for usage royalties, include the University's
committment to maintain the lesson in working order. In
particular, really gross things such as execution errors
would have to be fixed. Presumably the University would
ask the author to fix it.

3) If a lesson is used by a new audience for which it does
not "work", then yes, it is a "dead lesson" for that
audience until someone produces a revision or a different
lesson. Obviously presently satisfied users continue to
be satisfied.
4) Many authors have expressed concern over the lesson of
rapid revision and updating, which seems inherent to
published lessons. The point is that if rapid revision
and updating are going on, the lesson is suitable for use
in a controlled environmenta where the original author
is watching the class carefully, BUT THAT LESSON IS NOT
SUITABLE for use by other instructors, particularly at
other geographical locations. Authors will continue to
enjoy the advantages of rapid revision when using their
own unpublished lesson with their own students, but
other instructors can count on a published lesson working.

Peer review of lessons is indeed a problem when there is
only one place to publish. However, some lessons on
the system would clearly fail any fair review since they
contain material which is simply wron. Such lessons
do not bring credit to the publisher (PLATO). If many
of the published lesson are of poor quality then the
entire system suffers.
Is there a proceedure which permits authors to publish
lessons on PLATO but at least brings to their attention,
prior to publication, expert opinion on the content of
the lesson?
---------- response 22

Would the referencing problem mean than the contents of
datasets used by "published" lessons could not be changed
except by another published lesson, and that entries in
a leslist could not be changed at all?

In essence, a separate system would be created coexistent
with the current one, the only connection being possibly
through course records and the system catalog. (Would
this concept require that courses use all published or
all non-published material, with no mix of the two?)

I assume that a published lesson would have to cleanse
itself of idiosyncracies like name, course, site, and
time dependent features that would make it act differentntly
in away not understandable to naive users. Or such
dependencies clearly stated in some documentation within/
without the lesson.

1) Yes, review by peers would indeed be useful, and the
best way might be pre-publication review for the information
of the author. Hopefully most authors would be happy to
correct factualk errors. And I agree that there is a lot
of crud lying around that brings no credit  to PLATvo or the
authors. Howevr, some of that stuff has never in fact
been used with real students, and many such lessons have
glaring execution, display, and judging errors, all of
which would easily disqualify them from published status
as they now stand.
2) Yes, datasets referenced by a published lesson would
themselves be published. Intially we will presumably keep
it simply and published only nicely self-contained lesson,
then slowly figure out how to handle more exotic materials.
(If people are using datasets in actual instruction, as
opposed to data-keeping, they are on dangerous ground!)

  I must repeat a request for a much needed command.
There are many situations where multiple users of the same
sub system need to share a database (common and/or dataset)
while modifying its directories.. this of course means
that only one person can do a logical sequence of data
transfer at a time if that transfer is dependent on and/or
also modifies the directory (ies). Some people use flags
in common to tell when a medium is in use but these are not
relyable because of the inevitable possibility of system
celyable. The -press- command is VERY difficult to work
with when checking the validity of these flags as one may
have to a jumpout and jumpout return to press the key.
 I propose a command possibly called -in- of the form:
in station, lesson $$optional second arg.
returning in -error- -1 if station is in the lesson, 0 if
not 1 if common codes do not match.

   They only deal with datasets! Also after having read
AIDS it would seem that the only way one can tell
if a block has been reserved is by doing another reserve
command on the same block. -error- doest deal with
this possibility with the datain or dataout command.
Also reserve (according to AIDS) only reserves the
block for CHANGE not reading.. so a person may time he
in a directory that may be changed by the time he
gets around to restoring it!

   Besides all that the -in- command have many
uses in routers and interdependant lessons that I

data housekeeping ONLY.

                 3. student¬Dcomments/complaints
           1. An option for students to send/recieve
notes, which will (hopefully) be attachable to routers
so a student note flag can be set up.
           2. Simply a way for authors to contact students,
and a way of responding to option 3.
           3. An option which a student can use if he/she has
a suggestion/complaint about a lesson. It will be
set so that a certain person can read through these notes,
and resend them to the author of the lesson, which the
instructor must know (that is, the instructor must
know the sign-on of the author).
        What I'd like to know is if:
a. people feel there is a need for this type of lesson
b. you have any suggestions about this, please call me.

There is a SYSTEMS student-author notefile in the works --

         First of all, I don't intend to set up notefiles.

         Space would be too tight if I gave everyone
         their own notefile. It will just be set up
         so the program will check to see how many notes
         the person has, before any writing is done.

         Also, this will be setup on a course basis.

         All that will have to be done is to set up
         your own common in the ieu(and a few defines).
         The rest will be -use-able, and adaptable
         for any course.

         I've talked to Kim Mast, and he said that
         (as I understood it) that new student¬ dauthor.
         setup will be only that: student¬Dauthor.

I have been looking at some lessons and am disturbed by
the lack of professionalism and courtesy that seems to
be running rampant among PLATO authors. Hardly ever do I
see any references to texts, articles, other lessons, etc.
and unless my eyes deceive me, the content of many lessons
is not all original. Surely the same code of ethics should
operate here as does in publications. Surely the authors
I am speaking to would not try to publish an article without
faithfully listing references? Then why not on PLATO too?
Is anyone else disturbed about this? Has anything been
done about ethics at least or copyrighting at most?

        A while back,  I questioned the applicability of
copyright laws to material for PLATO, and got some interest-
ing responses from the systems people (the note can probably
still be found in old notes--around the middle of October
of last year), While the copyrightability of lesson
materials may, in my opinion, be questionable, there are
strict laws regarding the storage of printed materials in
any electronic device. So the question you raise may not
be merely one of professional courtesy or ethics, but one
of law as well.

It is difficult to draw general conclusions from looking
at a few lessons. Many programs, including all of mine,
do contain references to the literature for experimental
data and points of theory on which it is possible to
assign author credit. Material from text books is
reporduce only with written permission of the publisher
and the reference to both the book and permission is
always cited.

  02/12     13.43     steve       cu

     I would like to point out two inconsistencies in
TUTOR. Such variations cause immense grief for the
programmer who hasn't yet learned through experience
all the idiosyncrasies of this system.

1. In "aids!, the description of the -error- system
varible says that its value is -1 if there is an error,
and 0 if no error. But, the description of _chartst_ says
that -error- is -1 if the charset was loaded correctly
(no error), and 0 if not loaded(error). This has caused
at least two programmers here to make infinite charset
loading loops!
2. Also according to "aids", the values of -where-,
-wherex- and -wherey- indicate the last plotting activity
on the screen. But, it is also said that when using
-rdraw-, those varibles hold the last -at- position.
This is most unfair. -rdraw- already remembers the
location, why add to the misery?

       Steven Lionel

---------- response 1
  02/12     17.26     b sherwood       s

1) We realize that the use of the badly-named variable
"error" is inconsistent and poor. I wish it had a
different name, such as the "formok" which goes with the
-store- command. The now-preferred form is for the returned
info to be -1 if all is ok, and 0,1,2,3,etc. for various
unusual conditions. Each command writeup must be read
to see how it sets "error" (better named "return").
2) Since -rdraw- essentially resets the -at-, surely it
would be inconsistent for the "where" variables to have
something different???? That would be a worse
inconsistency!

   There are no "hidden" indexes to notes. You can look
at old notes by selecting that option. The general notes
(or maybe we will call them "public" notes--to contrast
with the "group, and "personal" notes) are currently in
the process of being revised to provide for more categories
than just "general" and "help" and to provide ways for users
to select which category of notes they wish to see (and
exclude all others). With several categories of notes to
separate comments out more, we hope that it will be easier

2)  How will the usage statistics be gathered to base
royalties on?

3) Will the system deduct charges for ECS and CPU from
the gross royalties, thus making long/complex programs
more expensive to run?

4) How are royalties on complex programs such as routing
procedures and service programs which interact only
peripherally with students to be determined? Possibly
a fixed percentage of the entire curriculum package?

I realize that if everyone wrote lessons in neat, self-
contained packages useable by the system router many of
these problems would not arise; but there are legitimate
pedagogical differences on this point. How will groups
electing to go the modular route be handled by the system?

1) Recreational games would certainly be publishable, at
least in the long run. But it would not be the University
of Illinois who would pay royalties to game authors, it
would be users on other PLATO systems. Note that some
systems might very well choose not to include games in
their catalog unless they had coin-operated terminals
on which to run them.
2) In the long run we will have to be able to publish
entire curricula, such as the highly integrated elementary
math and reading curricula, together with routers, etc.
This is giong to be exceedingly difficult, and will not be
incorporated in the first version of the catalog.
3) Lessons written by students in university classes would
normally be considered "commissioned" works and would
earn 40: of gross for the authors. Lessons written in
major projects by university staff (possibly with outside
grant money) are slmilar.

(I should add that commissioned works are "owned" by the
University, while non-commissioned works are "owned" by
the author. The practical consequences of ownership I
believe are neglible. What matters is the split in income.)
4) Muliple authors of a lesson would normally share
equally in income, unless they made a different agreement
among themselves. An "author" for these puroses need not
know TUTOR but might have designed the lesson, then worked
with a programmer.
5) We intend to collect usage data which would permit
authors to know by category how and where their lessons are
being used. These data would, on ther systems, permit
the calculation of royalties earned, on a student-hour

We hope a catalog of published lessons will appear before
summer. We do NOT expect royalty income for at least
five years, because there will be too little usage to
justify collection, There have to be many PLATO systems
with lots of terminals before income would be significant,
The point of building this machinery now is not to reward
authors, but to establish policy and get experience with
such policy for the benefit of future operations. Also,
an on-line catalog of published lessons is clearly needed
to meet current needs of instructors.

In reply to Steve Deiss, who is at Purdue (Lafayette),
yes, you DID read it right (sigh). The University does
indeed intend to charge non-university users of lesson
material a courseware royalty but will not pay royalties
for using lessons on its own campuses, no matter where on
the Urbana system those materials were created. (In
particular, no University faculty member will get royalties
for the use of his lessons on a University campus.)

I feel that such a policy can be defended on the basis of
the large investments made by the University to make
PLATO possible. However, I feel that this policy is not
feasible. It would be very easy to bury checks in a lesson
which lock out University station numbers. I feel that
the policy makes enemies unnecessarily, since the bulk of
the lessons have in fact been written on our campuses
anyway. Comments?

I don't think this policy is defensible on any grounds.

We payed to use your system to develope our courseware.
That is all you need. If U. of Ill. thinks it hasn't
charged enough. that is a different issue (about which
it is too late to do anything, I might add). But if U. of
Ill. somehow thinks that remote users are somehow parasites
who deserve some kind of lessor standing on the system,
then it is a whole new ball game. WE HAVE ALSO CONTRIBUTED
A LOT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS=S SYSTEM. There is no
basis for differentiation here. I don't think the
royalty agents at any of the remote sites like Purdue
could buy such an agreement. You might ask them. What
this will encourage is total secrecy about lessons written
at remote sites.

Obviously you have contributed a great deal to the system
development, but there is in fact a basis for
differentiation, since the University of Illinois worked
for 12 years on the problem before it even became possible
for other institutions to participate. Again I say that I
do not think the policy is appropriate, but it can surely
be adequately justified. Note that the PRACTICAL
consequences of either situation are minor. If we pay
for using your lessons, the outlay wil not be great, just
because the bulk of terminals (and, consequently, of
lessons) are on our campuses. Conversely, if we do not
pay for using your lessons, you personally will lose very
little, because tens of thousands of terminals are needed
for royalties to be singificant anyway, and the loss of
a few-hundred-terminal system is unimportant.

Given this situation, it would seem to me that the
University should pay royalties to retain the good will
of sister institutions, particularly since this good will
can be bought so cheaply and enormous ill will can so
easily be created over hypothetical royalties never to
be collected in the next 5 years.

There is one tricky consideration, tho. You can see why
the University would not want to pay me royalties on
physics lessons which I write and then prescribe for my
own students. They also don't want me moving to Purdue
just to have royalty access to the 30 University of Illinois
physics terminals! This may be an additional consideration
in their thinking.

         I think that this entire discussion, particularly

needs to be carefully re-thought. If all these hassles
were present on PLATO III, there might not be a PLATO IV.
Similarly, if immense hassles are created on PLATO IV, the
network of PLATO systems may never come to be. The only
people that may benefit are the various campus legal
counsels. PLATO's state of development is roughly that
of newspaper-by-facsimile in the late 40's. They blew
it, and disappeared. The moral is obvious.

On the contrary, if the major aspects of PLATO IV had not
been tested out on PLATO III, there could never have been
a PLATO IV. And if we do not figure out and establish
reasonable publication policies and procedures on PLAO IV
there will never be the next major advance, that of a
nation-wide utility.

These discussions would have been meaningless on PLATO III.
because we were not in a position to contemplate a national
grid of PLATO systems at that time.

I wonder what U. of Ill. would do if CDC demanded free use
of all lessons developed on all PLATO systems. "After all,"
the argument goes, "They put millions of man hours into
the development of the 6000 series computers long before
there ever was a PLATO, and have contributed tangibly to

Questions on "abort common" not covered in aids:?
1. If lesson A and B are using the same common, lesson A
does an abort common and is then recondensed, will lesson B
then be using the former disk copy of common, or latest ECS
copy? (I assume lesson A will get the former disk version:
is that a correct assumption?)?
2. Does the return common feature override an abort common?
I did a test where I entered lesson A, aborted common, then
entered author mode, selected R, entered the name of lesson
A, and got the message "common returned" !! (That seems to
imply that the abort executed in the lesson was overridden.)

Strange things happening here...there was a ** systems **
reply from white that apparently got lost in a system crash.
As I recall, the essence of the reply was:?
1.  When a common is aborted, all lessons currently in ECS
referencing that common continue to reference that aborted
common for as long as they remain in ECS. Any lessons which
are condensed _after_ the common has been aborted will get the
former disk copy of the aborted common. (The abort common
transforms a common into a "temporary" common -- it remains
in ECS, but is never returned to disk.)?
2.  The message about "common returned" (option R from
edit mode) is a fib. That message is given for temporary
commons (including aborted) as well as permanent commons.?
P.S. I think the "common returned" message ought to be
fixed -- if nothing is returned to disk, then say so.

  Since publishing has so many notes, I thought
I might add a bit on royalties. As to works written in
the past, it is not at all clear that the U. of I. has
any rights in works written at say Indiana University,
assuming the latter paid for its terminal, etc. As to
the future, the U. of I. may wish to include royalty free
use of programs in its contracts with outside users. In
that case the outside users might expect to pay less, but
might have to pay their authors more.
     Assuming that Indiana or Indiana authors _own_ programs
written there. if the U. of I. does not want to pay for

Deiss says they have "paid for service", which I think is
not quite accurate. They may have purchased terminals and
paid rent for the phone lines, but they have not paid for
computer calculation use, nor for disk space to store their
lessons, nor for the software investment in TUTOR itself,
nor for the author services such as AIDS and notes.

They could have purchased terminals from Magnavox and
paid the telephone company to attach them to IBM, but they
could not have obtained the goodies of PLATO anyplace
else, and those goodies were not paid for by Purdue.

I.e., Purdue has only paid for the physical

the service itself.

Not true Judy, because according to Dr. Propst and

I wish I could produce that in writing for you, but my

because they are not "in the business". Something to do

Sorry, beloved Judy, you actually made (gasp!) a mistake.
Purdue does indeed pay for computer services, a fee which
is to include CPU, disk, consulting, etc. My earlier point
was that the fee does not pay for the developmental costs
of the first 12 years nor present developmental costs of
the next (PLATO V?) system, though I personally don't like
the University policy. It would also seem that the absence
of prior contracts would make it impossible to get out of
paying royalties on lessons already written. (Deiss is
absolutely correct:  we still have no formal written
contract spelling out duties and responsibilties to users!)

Finding student authors years later will be no different
from any other kind of publishing. One just has to set
up accounts which can be claimed within N years.

Would this be possible:

Illinois doesn't pay Purdue to use Purdue's lessons and
Purdoe doesn't pay Illinois. since both schools are on the

Any Illinois or Purdue lessons used by a different Plato
system are subject to royalties. Likewise any lessons
produced on other Plato systems and used by Illinois or
Purdue are paid royalties.

.....so all lessons written on this system and used

to re-hash the comments on lesson review: it seems that
review comments fall into at least 4 categories.

        1) execution errors, overwrites, etc.
        2) grammar, syntax, punctuation---to achieve
        credibility, many lessons currently in use will
        need to be spruced up, i feel.
        3) technical accuracy---determined, as mentioned, by
        peer review.
        4) instructional design (interaction, sequencing,
        presentation, individualization, etc.)---in other
        words, why the lesson is on PLATO.

this last aspect seems the most important, though the most
difficult to judge. unfortunately, there are presently many
lessons on PLATO which could pass the first three checks,
which have endured many students, but which fail because of
the instructional design.

the need for reviews is clear, the source for reviewers is
a bit less clear. if pre-publication reviews are to be
done, as bruce suggests, the burden of finding reviews is
likely to fall on the author. this may produce reviews
less objective than desireable. can CERL provide reviews
for the expected volume of published lessons? the MTC
group's experience with reviews suggests that reviewing
is time-consuming and that some people simply don't have a
knack for it. there is a further problem in describing
standards precisely enough so that two reviewers can produce
reviews which are comparable. a final difficulty is that
the qualifications for a subject matter expert are more
easily defined than those for an instructional design
expert.

ok... i have been waiting to make all my comments in one
lump sum on the material to date:

First (minor) point: please include in lesson criterion
the ability to get your screen replotted. as cited in
general note 384 and other instances in the past, line
errors ARE here with us to stay somewheres in the system.
There is nothing more frustrating for any student than not
being able to answer an arrow because the rest of the screen
is blank.

Regarding lesson review: review by people in the same field
may not always be feasible in small fields (like mine).
Perhaps some kind of general review to test the "mechanical
aspects" (exec errors, help available, spelling, etc) of
published lessons would be required; essentially this would
be a proofreading review. I would be happy to serve in that
capacity. A review of content/teaching method could be

an optional feature (with or without seal-of-approval) since
the author, in the final analysis, is responsible for the
content of his lesson (and liable for it, as far as i under-
stand!).

Regarding the UI's desire not to pay royalties on material
developed on the Urbana system: The most prevalent reason
I recall reading to date is that UI has invested consider-
able time/s in developing PLATO to this point. However, as
I understand it, anything developed with funding from NSF
is in the public domain. Since UI did not exclusively
underwrite the first 15 years of PLATO development, can it
really claim blanket exemption of royalties on that basis?
If so, then I could see "mtcc" people asking for royalty
exemptions also since DOD underwrote part of PLATO develop-
ment also. In fact, ever taxpayer underwrote part of PLATO

development!
Bonnie's idea of no-royalties-within-each-system sounds
good on the surface. However, if YOU were on another system
some pressure might be placed on you to utilized material
developed on your own system wherever possible (even if it
were a little bit inferior to stuff available eleswheres) in
order to avoid royalties. This, in turn, would lead to re-
dundancy in development and also mean that the BEST material
would not be available on all PLATO systems across the
country. The potential to provide a uniform excellence of
material across the USofA should not be discouraged.

Summary of suggestions:
1. Include replot of screen as a criterion for a "clean
proff" of a lesson.
2. Require mandatory "proofreading" of lessons before giving
them the Published status. Optional review by colleagues in
field (so noted on title screen).

I think the point may have been missed. I believe that
what both IU and Purdue are saying is not that they
should not have to pay royalties, nor that they dont want
to share courseware with the U of I......rather that U of I
(main campuses) has no right to demand royalty free access
to all lesson material written and published through the
Urbana Plato system. They especially dont have that right
regarding material developed at remote non U of I sites,
because those sites paid for the use of all goods and
services supplied by U of I in the process. The point is
that there is no basis for dividing Plato users into first
and second class citizens. One exception and there can
be no rules.
Perhaps, Bonnies point should be reconsidered. It would
certainly be much simpler and no new accounting software
would need to be written if authors were just paid a fee
when a lesson is xported.

Someone asked about lessons written as course projects. As
stated earlier. these would normally be considered
"commissioned" works.

No royalties can be collected on NSF-funded lessons at
least until 1976. However, NSF is not necessarily against
royalties in principle--they are interested in wide-spread
use. For there to be wide-spread use, in the long run it
will be important to have some kind of "publisher" worrying
about maintaining catalogs and distributing lessons. To
support this and encourage authors, royalties are important.

If you create a policy of not charging people on this
system for using lessons developed on this system, where
is the royalty incentive to write lessons here? Given many
many PLATO systems, good authors will gravitate toward
other systems which do pay royalties.

If it comes to the point where superior lessons material
is exported from one system to another, thereby incurring
royalties, I wonder how easy it will be for instructors to
become aware of and view material not on their own system;
the difficulties may inhibit lesson distribution.

If the plans are for a nation-wide PLATO V network with
terminals in schools, businesses, and even homes -- which
is far off but certainly worth striving for --, the
situation may be analogous to cable TV: independent groups
design, produce and market a product to a publisher who
collects his money directly from the consumer.

I strongly favor royalty payments as an incentive to
authors; and I think that the amounts of money involved may
someday be large.

(I do agree that the University of Illinois may be justified
or even wise to refuse to pay royalties top U of Ill.
authors.)

Most of the previous discussion assumes that the users will
be making regular royalty payments for the lessons they use.
It need not be that way, and I suspect that it won't be.
Instead, the regular use fee paid by users for the PLATO
service might contain a portion intended for authors.
Having paid that use fee, a user has access to any published
lessons (except for certain special high-cost lessons) with-
out further payment.

Under this scheme, the software keeps track of actual use
not so as to bill the user, (he has already paid), but so
as to pay the authors.

On the PLATO page where the new student makes up
a password, I would like to recommend that the
word "not" in "...not over 10 letters" be emphasized
using caps: "NOT"

Many of our students have somehow managed to think
they should type 10 letters.

---------- response 1

They sure do over react to 10 letters...and likewise
they soon forget their password. Also many who have not
much experience typing, find their want of 10 letters very
frustarting if they have to signon often.

Perhaps a six letter password would be nice for students.
Just a thought! I myself am satisfied with the 10, but
I am not inclined to long entries.

I second the "one to ten letters" idea. With the present
text, some of my students get the idea that the password
must contain more than ten letters. Something like "up
to ten letters" should probably be avoided too. Doubtless
many of the students would take this to mean that ten
letters were required. Likewise "ten or fewer letters"
might suggest to them that ten letters should be aimed for
where in practice a shorter password is usually easier
to remember (and to type in without making errors).

Two suggestions concerning the new course statistics now
available as option 5 (if the course is using the system
router):?
1. Very obvious, why not make options 1 and 2 (within the
statistics option available to all courses. So far as I
can see, this info is available in any course regardless
of its router.?
2. When the individual stats are being listed, it is
desirable to put in some message that indicates the
operation is complete. Since the entire option is (I assume)
cpu and I/O bound, it is likely that autobreaks will occur
in this listing so the user does't know whether he is
in autobreak or the list is complete.

---------- note 450 condense
  02/13     14.50     maggs       law

Condense queues are longer for authors since ECS became
available. I would guess that this problem is made worse
by the fact that there is less incentive for an author
to use partial condense, since he is pretty sure of getting
the ECS he needs in any event. We could restore this
incentive by having a new quickie condense option for
lessons needing 1500 words or less of ecs space.
Abuse of this option would be prevented by deleting any
lessons immediately if they turned out to be longer when
condensed.
   How about it, systems, is it worth the trouble?
Incidently, what is the current mix of authors and students
condensing?

as a quick guess....authors account for at least 80;
of condensing.

the average number of lines per lesson condensed is
about 444...but we currently don't keep the statistic of
how long the average binary is....that indeed would be a
nice one to keep!

we are condensing about 15 lessons per minute during
prime-times

AND...we loan binaries instead of condensing a lesson
about half the time!

1) This type of note should not be in general notes.
   It should be in personal notes! Since you can get
   into lesson eex04 to see who the author and/or last
   editor is, you can sent a personal note to the named
   user (unless his course is not prepared.) If you cannot
   see the data page, call Tebby Lyman (tebby of pso): she
   can usually help you find the author of a lesson.

2) That particular lesson (eex04) is part of the CGE system
   which involves connection of a complete electronics
   laboratory workstation to the terminal's ext jack.
   This means that without a duplicate of the lab setup
   (detailed in lesson cge: run this lesson for more info)
   there is no reason or profit in running this lesson
   at your site.

error or the like. I would also like to know this

       Thanks....
P.S. I'd like to know myself..Make it as simple
as possible....

---------- response 1
  02/14     02.33     k gorey       o

   There are 3 basic types of ECS errors that occur on our
system.

1) Those that occur outside of the operating system. These
   are the non-fatal errors, usually only noted for the
   engineers.

2) Those errors that occur in part of the formatter, or
   outputter. This is when you will usually see the Plato
   Off message.

3) Those errors that kill the Central Memory Resident.
   The system will 'seize up' in those cases, requiring
   the whole thing to be reloaded.

  ECS errors usually take the form of a parity error in
which the system senses the wrong number of bits set in a
word involved in a CM-ECS transfer.

---------- response 2
  02/14     10.35     judy       pso

To expand and be more basic:

The memory of the computer (including ECS) is made up of
little tiny "magnets". When the pole of the magnet points
"north", then that magnet is called a 1. If the pole of
the magnet points "south", then the magnet is called 0.
The computer uses only 0's to do all of its
thinking. When a 0 should be changed to a 1, the tiny
magnet gets hit by a tiny electrical current and turns
over, so that its pole points in the opposite direction.
Sometimes (I don't know why) they don't turn over properly.

A computer word looks like this:
  0010111100101
When transferring words, the computer counts the 1's
in each word. There are 7 ones in the word above. If
needed, it adds a 1 at the "end" so that there will _always_
be an even number of 1's:
 0010111100101 1¬A "parity bit"
(cont.)

---------- response 3
  02/14     10.42     judy       pso

After the transfer is completed, the computer checks to
see if the "computer word" it received has an even number
of bits sent (counting the parity bit). If the number is
not even, then somewhere an error has occurred, and this
error is called a "parity error".

What it all boils down to in the end, is that because a
magnet did not flip over properly, a word like
  "stop" has been changed to "hop"
and the computer simply does not know how to interpret
this new "instructioin".

Kevin's 3 classes of errors could be compared with the
body....

1) minor error: could be a bad nerve impulse to a finger.
     The brain (Central Memory) can fix that by sending a
     new impulse. This compares to a computer error in a
     single lesson.
2) PLato Off error: nerve to leg is severed. The brain
     can't fix it, but can send a verbal message (Plato off)
     acknowledging the accident.
3) big crash: major brain injury or a stroke. The brain
     itself is injured and can't be fixed. Have to start
     all over again.

Fortunately for humans, the brain is much more flexible and
has zillions more alternate pathways than a computer, so
we can recover from most brain injuries.

---------- response 5
  02/14     15.28     walker       s

Just one additional point...as recently as 2 weeks ago _all_
ECS errors were of the fatal variety .. either type 2 or 3.
Unfortunately, each piece of coding which reads ECS requires
a different proceedure to either recover from an error or
just knock off the stations directly concerned with the
failing area. We will continue to fix the various programs
as we have time...but the software can never fix up all the
possible failures of such an important piece of hardware
as ECS.
       I thought people might like to know this as it is
the sort of info which does not get into 'new system fea-
tures'.

---------- response 6
  02/15     12.18     rader       s

A further point....there are a lot of electronic circuits
which take the data from Judy's magnetic cores in ECS to
those in Central Memory--and the errors we experience are
almost always in the circuits, not in the cores. Just a
detail, but those of you who started building better cores
to help us out should work on circuits instead....!

        1) We frequently make lessons available to those
in the health science fields that we feel can use them in
context. We are reluctant to release them for general
publication at this time. As with medicine, a "little"
knowledge can do more harm than it does good on occasion.

        2) I also have this fear: published lessons may be
negotiated away under conditions with which we may not
agree. For example, a contract may be made between CDC
and the university in which ownership of lessons may be
lost in a short time and methods of monitoring who is
using the lesson unknown. (continued)

Vet. publishing continued:
        3) We still have been unable to define an " author"
I have recommended that anyone who has _substantive_ input
in a lesson should have a percentage of the "author"
whether he be subject-matter specialist, lesson designer,
or programmer. Without each of these, we cannot get the
lesson used (instructor), organized (lesson designer), and
imaginatively working properly (programmer.) Yet, we do
have some here who feel that they should have all the 
credit and that others are like type-setters in a printing
plant.

        4) Some of our instructors do not want the lessons
released generally. e.g. meat inspection, because some
may feel that they can do the job after the program without
really having the background (continued)

they can do just as good a job in meat inspection as
veterinarians. Perhaps they can at inspection. but we

tations of their findings. (Continued with next note)

        6) Until we are firmer on what will happen with
published lessons, we will be limiting those we release
for publication, and then only with the writtten concent
of those involved in preparing the lesson.

        5) We hope to cooperate with Purdue School of
Veterinary Medicine in writing and sharing lessons.
Together we hope to evaluate one anothers lessons by both
students and authors.

PLATO IS SUCH A WONDERFUL IDEA, I HOPE THAT THE IDEA WILL
NOT BE LOST IN tHE MINUTIA OF LEGALISM AND SELFISHNESS,
ALTHOUGH I REALIZE THAT RIGHTS AND WORK MUST BE PROTECTED.

erinary students learning at a high level and in a way that
make learning enjoyable. We want to turn out a good vet-
erinarian who wants to keep learning after graduation.

1) Certainly if you want to keep lessons out of the hands
of the general public, for whatever reason, you should not
publish them. I would be interested to understand better
the rationale for this in the case of medicine. What
prevents me from going to the library or bookstore and
getting a book on anatomy or meat inspection or quantum
mechanicas, and tasting the forbidden fruit that way?
2) As to losing control thru the University sending lessons
to other PLATO systems, this is again the normal situation
with publishing. The author cannot control how the
publisher sells his book. And, for that matter, the
publisher has to be willing to sell the book to anyone who
asks to buy it. This seems to me the essence of publishing.
If an author wants to restrict his audience, he does not
publish.

3) Who is an author is something to be fought out among
those who contributed to the creation of the lesson. If
your faculty are able to exclude programmers from sharing in
possible royalty income. that is their own political affair.
It is certainly not uncommon for professors to take much
of the credit for work done by their graduate students.
But this sport of sordid politics is not something that
CERL is going to meddle in. We will simply require some
kind of statement from whomever submits a lesson for
publishing that the lesson is the work of the people named
on some form they will have to fill out.

Certainly I feel that the various people participating in
the creation of the lesson should all share in credit and
possible income. There may be some special cases where
the contribution was mere typing and is simply acknowledged
without participation in royalties.

---------- response 4
  02/15     14.13     b sherwood       s

(?] should point out that faculty who assert on a legal
form that a lesson is exclusively their own work may be
subject to legal action from a programmer who may very
well be able to show substantial creative input to the
lesson. The University will surely arrange the paperwork
in such a way as to place a goodly share of the legal
burden for determining clear title on that faculty member.)

Thanks, George, for your comments. It does sound as though
you may not want or need published lesson status for your
materials, at least at this time. You might think however
about how to distribute materials to other vet schools who
in the long run might be attached to other PLATO systems.

The rest of the note says that I have to go through two

---------- response 1
  02/15     15.22     parrello       uimatha

The change code thingie has to do with the fact that if

else is editing that block, things get screwed up.

---------- response 2

  To clarify (i hope) what bruce is saying:
If you could multiple block copy from a lesson you only had
the inspect code for, it would be necessary to "attatch"
that lesson to your signon (this also happens when
you see the "curently being edited" note, the lesson is
"attatched" to the signon currently editing the lesson
and therefore shouldnt be attatched to yours).

   <K, so now imagine yourself going in to edit your lesson
to get it something done for a deadline you GOTTA meet
and some idiot has decided to "fool" you and sit there
multiple block copying all day. Your lesson cant ever
be attatched to your records so you can edit it. And all
this guy has is the inspect code!

 There are other rationale for this (for consistency's
sake) like only allowing multiple block X searches
to those with the change code.
 I hope this information is clear and accurate.

---------- response 3
  02/17     10.26     berger       users

Let's make it even clearer.
When someone multiple block copies a lesson, he
is given a block directory which is accurate only
at the time it is displayed. If someone else is
currently editing the lesson, and rearranges the
blocks, your copy of the lesson directory may copy
garbage, rather than the expected block. For example,
you may get one part of a charset.

The easiest way around this is to attach the lesson
to the person copying, to insure that the directory
is not changed while he's copying.

I certainly don't want my lesson attached to anyone
without the proper change code.

You might be interested to know that after the many ECS

Crotser did this morning find a sensitivity to timing
signals which could conceivably have been responsible. He
had a very difficult time finding this, becuase the unusual
exercise of ECS provided by PLATO operations caused failures
but his maintenance test routines did not.

Another case of the difficulty of simulating PLATO

  OK Larry, to avoid the legal hassle of ambiguous

 Given a new author who knows nothing about work vars
a terminal and the AIDS writeop on work vars, what do you
think his impression of what work vars will do at the
beginning of each timeslice would be?

 Perhaps that they are "altered unpredictably"
(ie: garbage values) " usually"? (ie: sometimes they
AREN'T altered unpredicatbly which means that they
would have to be a function of some data accessable to
the program)

significant load on the disk system and is therfore done
only for the students who really need it.

(We probably should send editted blocks back to disk
occasionally, tho that would tend to ruin the advantages
of the "OUT" option. Perhaps if you have been editing

  I would like to continue this discussion on checkpointing

continue in the replies to a previous mostly irrelevant

edited lessons would be similar to the solution used in
NEWS. viz. allowing presses of STOP (or possibly some
other key) to return the block to disk, update the directory
of the lesson and return directly to the block. It would
have a similar effect to BACK-NEXT1 without the dexterity.
I would be willing. and I think most authors would. to
wait a few seconds for **PROCESSING** to take place.
Also, why not a tagged -checkpt- command that would return
both student records and common, and force a short pause

I've never really had any problem with doing BACK, NEXT1
to save blocks; and I'm wholeheartedly AGAINST having this
done automatically -- even if you could set up some kind of
timed return, sooner or later you're going to have a block
returened that you will wish hadn't been.
      Probably the smart thing to do is be a little more
aware of the necessity of updating things yourself from

options, manipulable by your own private record keeping

     According to AIDS, -wherex- contains the position of
the next panel activity. If one says:
at   100,100
write   012345
     -wherex- rightfully contains 148. However, if you say:
calc    n1?'A' $$ octal 07001000000...
at  100,100
showa  n1,2
     -wherex- containg 116! It plotted only the "A", if the
tag on the -showa- was 1, it would only plot the shift code,
which is invisible, but -wherex- would still be 108!
     This action goes against the fundamental definition
of the -where- variables. They should contain actual
screen activity coordinates, not a mythical calculated one.
It's much worse if you have something like ¬W(0767027)!

Reasonable explaination: It takes a significant amount
  of cpu time to compute where the tag of the showa
  actually ends. Since in most cases you don't need
  to know where it ends, we don't compute it.

If you need to know where the screen position really
is, you can do so by using an embeded showa instead. e.g.

write ¬0a,'A'¬1

where we do compute the displayed length and update
*where* appropriately.

If you don't like us using -return- commands. then why don't
you fix showa so that where, (and wherex) work. I actually
have a piece of a lesson that counts backward to get rid
of 000 and blanks so that I could get around what I figured
must have been a bug in where. It seems to me that people
willing to spend cpu time in embedded shows should be
equally willing to spend it in showa.
   It is a small price to pay for having the "where"

I have not waited more than 30 seconds or so, even with
repeated condesing of short lessons.

In order to achieve a 5 minute wait, it would seem that
you must be condesing 8000 words once every 2 minutes!

Don't forget to use partial condesnsing. Sometimes
testing a long, complicated lesson sequence seems to
need the whole lesson. However, one can often write
a little unit (just for testing) which will fill in
typical values for all of the variables which must be set.
This unit can then be substituted for all of those blocks
and blocks of "set up". It will save testing time, as
well as condesing time.

W/ respect to partial condesing and condesing time,

In regards to condense strings, they can be VERY long

Unless I misread the systems featurtes note there is _no_
priority advantage given to students. They do use the
condensor less frequently than authors (of course if
a lesson is already condensed by one student no others
using it use the condensor) which leaves us atuhors a poor
second (or 57^t^h).

I wonder if giving authors condensing lessons ¬<1500 wds.
a higher priority would be that advantageous. The present
system rewards the small lesson size and the proposed one
would tend to encourage higher frequency of condensing,
which is somewhat self-defeating.

      The present system DOES reward those who condense
smaller lessons, as I believe it assigns priority based
on ms/minute condense time. Thus, you can condense a
couple of smaller lessons and your condense priority
will be better than the person who condenses a huge
lesson. Thus, the priority is assigned based on past
condensing, not on future.

Indeed, it was not intended that this option be used to

Couldn't the names just be entered in their place on the

      While useing -copy- I noticed the following occurance;
if the character count at the arrow was 8, 18, 28, 38,
etc. and that line was subsequently placed in the copy
buffer, then the result of pressing shift-copy at the 
next arrow was not an 8, or 28 character line. Instead 
the following vars. were filled w/ the characters plus 
spaces.
        This was caused because I was modifying the 
original 8 character string by placing 071 in the right 
of the variable. For example, student types '11111111' (¬a)
after I add the 071 the octal code is 034343434343434340071.
The similarity between character counts of 8, 28, ¬+ 38
is the 00071. The number of spaces put into the copied
line is also equal to 57 (071). If 01, 02, or 03

I feel that if a course's personal note file gets full,
the course director should leave a sign-in note to all
the offenders, and that the system should not be concerned 
if a file is full or empty. If, for example, there were 
some penalty for filling up all 14 blocks of a lesson,
why have 14 blocks?

        Though skipping over notes is very simple, and
has been suggested before, it has not been implemented for 
the very reason mentioned in the original note -- people
have too great a tendancy to keep notes lying around.

       I feel self destruction of notes is an awful
dangerous algorythm to implement. Destroying notes right 
now is so simple, I see no reason why a machine should
dc what is best left to human descision.

        We are having the same problem here...
We have several authors that don't run that often nay
more, and consequently when their notes files get to
the point that each of them has 4-5 notes (and the rest 
of us have 3-4) our course con't recieve notes.
        This means that we have to hunt up these authors
that don't run all that often and have them to clear
out their respective files. This gets to be a drag both
for them and us.
        While I dont as yet have a suggestion to prevent
this type of occurance I am putting in a positive vote
that somethinng shold be done along these lines...

it should not be the systems's business if we want to
save our notes till the end of time. Disk space, allotted
to us on a group basis, should be ours to spend as we see
fit. If course directors have only allotted a certain
amount of space for notes, then it is their problem to
police and use it effectively.
Are you telling us its more efficient to save notes in
a lesson space. Please explain.

those of us who get a lot of mail and must save notes
until they are dealt with would be swearing a lot if access
rates to the notes slowed down. All my notes are where
they are because that is my central source of 'current 
business to deal with' -- and it would not be nice to have
to put half of that in a lesson because you slowed my access
to my notes.

     Would it be possible to have the notesfile act as a 
"router", so that a lesson and block could be specified for
pnotes? This way, an author with a little spare lesson
space could opt to have his notes "delivered" to his lesson,
requiring no notesfile space, but still setting the "NOTES"
flag. I don't know how practical this is, but I figured I
might as well join in the fray, too.

        In response to "little buddy":

        The system has assumed the disk space for the
personal notes files. Thus, at least as far as I know
(and it was for sure the case for "matha") no courses have
been charged for the disk space used in personal notes.
It has been the tendancy recently, for courses to request
more disk space when their notes files have filled up,
instead of having their authors be more conservative in
their saving of notes.

        I can only think of a few people who, like you,
can justifiably keep around more than just a few notes
at once. Inspection of notes files reveals that many, many
people do keep around a large number of notes (I have no
idea what for, though.) Perhaps GROUP notes can take much
of the burden off of the people in charge of large projects
who have to keep track of a lot of things at once.

i had forgotten that the space for notes was donated by

for it? You are currently charging for every other kind
of space.

Cne constructive suggestion:
When you go to write a pnote to a given author, how about
recieving a message like
"gabby of peanuts can recieve 2 more notes"
and then deciding whether to write him a new note?
I can say from personal experience that people who just want 
to chat, and who do not completely understand the system,
can be a bother. (see iu5, blocks "notes".) If there was an
indication of how much space an author had left, that would
be some encouragement to others to leave some of his spaces
open.

IF the system started charging for note files, it would
cost Glenn exactly the same-- on a "group" basis -- to save
notes in his pnote file as to save notes in his own lesson
space. So maybe he would like to donate a lesson space
to his pnote file!

        Oh well, Thanks Judy.

        Nothing will be done on the proposal immediately,
(I've noticed a tendEncy already for people to be a little
more notes conscious!) Charging for file space might be
a feasible solution, but there is a chance that sometime
in the future all individual course notes files will
dissapear in favor of one large large one to be maintained
by the system.

        The sending of notes directly to a lesson poses
many interesting questions: should a new ("notes") type
block be set up to receive them? What about security? My
first in terms of disk accessing, but the idea is certainly
worth considering.

"one large notes file maintained by the system" would seem
to encourage just the sort of behavior that occasioned
this series of notes..."tragedy of the commons"...unless
it were doled out on a basis that incorporated time into
the unit of measure...eg., course zonk's allotment is
640 note-hours/week.

        do i understand correctly from the system responses
that someone may be paging thru my notes file from time
to time just to see what is to be found there?

        All anyone can see is who has notes, and how many
notes he has. This information is only available to systems
     personnel and to your course director.

Would it be possible for the course director to lower
the limit on the number of personal notes some
authors receive. This would ease the problem of
authors who rarely sign-on but receive 4 or 5 notes.
Such authors could be reduced to a maximum of 1 or 2
notes. This would also leave more room for those
people who must save notes.

The problem is that for various technical reasons it is 
difficult for us to catch this in the -define-, because
the extreme generality of the -define- is partly due to 
not running the right side of the -define- thru the
expression compiler. We just put away the individual
pieces of the definition for use later. Not likely to
change in the near future. Sorry! Thanks for pointing
this out, even tho we can't do anything about it.

is there a way of testing if a number is legal as a station

for a reserve table -- only station numbers are -calc-ed
into the array ¬+ nothing but a legal value could be there
(unless some remote or bizarre error puts a garbage value
there) -- still it would be nice to have a test (something

is there any possibility of the old "sites" lesson
again being made available? several times i've
needed to contact authors or students running in
our courses at another site, but due to "talk"
options being turned off, or lack of the course
security code, this was impossible.

the clincher came this evening, when a student 
using a multiple record at 11-13 was adding obscene
notes to our commetns lesson faster than i could
delete them or change the record's security code.
it seems a shame to penalize the majority of
responsible users by restricting the record to
"known" persons, but as i could not contact the 
site director in this case, there seems to be
no alternative...

A while back there was a rumor floting around the system
that copy-a-blocks would be enabled from datasets soon.
Is this rumor correct? if not, cant it be _made_ correct?
There are many situations in which an author maight want
to copy a piece of "generated" code from another lesson
or routine. My own algprob, and moldraw, are two major
examples. At present, algprob is unusable because of the
demand for the change code to copy the common block. Since
a¬ dataset can't¬ be changed anyway with the change code alone,
is there any reason not to allow copy-a-block from it?

---------- response 1
  02/20     20.38     foster       uimc

Why not do what moldraw (my lesson now) does?
Simply name your blocks 1,2,3,4,etc.
Then instruct the user to :
1. Create a common block in your lesson
2. Insert the following code in your lesson:??
   common mylesson,mycom,322? use algprob,1? use 2? use 3? use 4
   use 5? etc... to end.???
3. Condense that block of your lesson.
4. Return common to disc ('R' in author mode)
5. -DATA1- the common to source.
6. There's the code, in your own common block.??
This would enable you to protect your lesson with a 
security code yet still have common available to the user.

The recent period of system instability has caused problems
with the collection of student data. Datafiles in use
when a system crash occurred often have blocks which are
labelled as full, but whose data seems to be invisible--
it cannot be seen using the data editor, nor read using
-readl- or -reada-, nor printed. These datafiles can
be patched to recover almost all of the data. Users of
datafiles should check to make sure that all blocks of
data are really there before having prints made or
reading data out of the files. If you do have problems

Sigh. Will be a long time before this one if fixed!

Here is the problem: You might define i, n, and s in
the student define set. But you still want it to be the
case that if the student writes "sin(30¬0)" you want this
interpreted as the sine of 30 degrees, not as s?i?n?(30¬0)!
In other words, we first look thru the built-in functions
(sin, cos, exp, etc.) before looking at your student
define set (unlike condensing, where your definitions take
precedence). So cosh(5) is interpreted as cos(h)(5).
Of course it would be preferable to merge the two sets so
that we could take the longest character string, whichever
set it is in, but there are some problems with that too.

from another charset (option 6), and you're in one
block charset, with all 14 blocks in use, and the
charset you're copying has/will put your total 
above 79 characters? I tried this, and there is
no warning. You just lose the rest of the

Ok, will check it out. Note that you can find out how much 
space is available (see option 2, "slots available") -- it's
sometimes easier to get a enough space for a two-block set,
THEN do the entire block copy.

Any other suggestions? Send them to me in a Pnote or

Several people have asked me what their situation is with
respect to lessons based upon material copyrighted by others
not connected with PLATO. These questions take two forms:
1. What should I do if I am planning to use such materials?
2. I went ahead and used them without permission -- what do
   I do now?
The answer to the first question is fairly clear. If you
are planning to use the materials with students you will be
violating the other party's copyright, unless the amount
taken is so minor (<50 words) as to be insignificant.
Therefore, you should either obtain prior permission, or
hope you won't get caught. If you do not obtain permission,
your lesson will never be able to be "published" and
distributed through official channels to other systems. If
you distribute it widely enough unofficially, you are likely
to get caught (continued)

---------- response 1 
  02/20     10.03     maggs       law

(continutation) and if you get caught the consequences may
be very unpleasant, such as forced erasure of the lesson.
The best time to bargain for permission is before you have
put any work in. At that point, since you have nothing to
lose, and the original author has something to gain, game
theory says you are in a good bargaining position. If at
all possible, you should try to get permission not only for
experimental use on the Urbana system, but also for eventual 
further distribution, so as to take maximum advantage of 
your bargaining position.
    Suppose you have gone ahead without permission. At this
point game theory tells us that _if_ the other party knows
how much you have done, you bargaining position is worse,
since now you stand to lose your investment unless you
agree to the other party's terms. Thus a cautious approach
is necessary (continued)

---------- response 2
  02/20     10.07     maggs       laws 

(continued) in you bargaining approach. You will face
particular problems in dealing with a commercial
publisher, since such publishers tend to have a rather
inflated idea of copyright values.

    To sum up, the importance of settling this issue
early cannot be overemphasized. At worst, you may have
to create materials yourself. However, this may be a
real blessing in disguise, since, materials adated
from another medium may not fully use PLATO capabilities.
Furthermore, you are free to take any basic mathematical
a lgorithms--these are not protected by copyright. What
is protected is the language that appears on the screen,
and the basic plot or scenario of the copyrighted work,
but only to the extent the plot is an innovation on what
has gone before.

Question:

we put on our lesson to indicate that our permission is

Getting back to the discussion of lesson publishing, I
haven't seen any reply to the query about updates of
published lessons when the system modifies or deletes a 
command. Did I miss it? As one of the people at CDC, I
am rather interested, especially as we don't have the
routine currently used to update lessons to new instruction
forms. (Does this routine work for binaries? Just
curious.)

Also, there is the question of transportability. Right
now, a large number of the lessons taken from the U of I
system need some modification to run on the CDC system.
While this is usually minor, the volatile nature of the
U of I system makes it a constant problem.

Conversion programs are written specifically for mods that
effect user programs. (changes to commands mostly).
These conversion routines do not change lesson binaries,
since they are ususally lost on system reload anyway, it
usually doesn't matter. These conversion routines are
increasingly hard to write with the more lessons that are
delevoped. (there are many more people that they effect,
and also they take quite a while to run.)

Published lessons will, by their very nature, be at least
several months old, usually much older. They should not be
newer than the "published version" of the software, and they
should work.
When software changes are made, source conversions on all
older published lessons may be needed.

Blackstar:

I am grateful for your timely concern about transportability
of PLATO lessons. I would like to see incompatible systems
avoided (you stated that there already exists some minor
problems.) Could work be placed into keeping the different
PLATO systems absolutely compatible with one another without
having to sacrifice the 'volatile nature of U of I plato'?
For me, that is one of the best feature of this system -
the ability of change when needs present. I am not willing
to say 'this is where i want the system to freeze' but in 
the interest of courseware transfer you discuss that. Is
there a way to keep the ability to change AND stimulate
transfer of materials? Could all 3 current PLATOs be 
simultaneously kept with the same system..it seems there 
should be the technology to do that, but i don't know for
certain.

---------- response 4
  02/21     10.54     b sherwood       s

Just to second what Midden and Golden said:

Published lessons would by their nature be a little "old"
and not dependent on brand-new features. It is in principle
possible for future changes to require source conversions,
in which case these conversions would be run on all
existing PLATO systems. This should be easy to do, since
it is planned that systems will be linked electronically,
not by mail. (The Minneapolis-Urbana link should be
operating within a few months.)

My own guess, backed by recent experience, is that source
conversions are now rare and getting more rare. The bulk
of present and future changes are in the nature of new 
features rather than changes to old features.

---------- response 5
  02/21     10.56     b sherwood       s

As to the updating of systems to get NEW features, this is
obviously an absolute necessity. There seems to be some
feeling at CDC that it would be adequate to freeze PLATO
at some arbitrary date, in the same way that conventional
systems are managed. This is just not feasible for PLATO
operations. All systems MUST be updated every few months.

If IBM can do it, can't Plato??
The frequent "new releases" of OS/360 are a nuisance, to
say the least, but IBM/360/370 users have learned to live
with them. In particular, new releases are usually of the
"new features added and bugs fixed" variety, rather than
the "old features changed" variety. I'm not holding IBM
practices up as a shining example, but I note a similarity
between IBM practice and Plato plans here, and I'm hoping
that (as a minimum) Plato can do the new-release-is-
compatible bit as well as IBM can. Note that mose IBM
users have little or no trouble about old programs working
on new releases (what troubles there are, are not usually
of that type!).

A lot of the discussion and decisions about what CDC is
going to be doing with Plato takes place at a much higher
level than me, so whatever I say here must be taken with
a grain of salt.

However... it is my impression that CDC is intending,
eventually, to have a large network of Plato systems,
interconnected in (at least) the manner of the Urbana-
Minneapolis link.

In such a system, updates to the system would be fairly
simple to do in all cases. However, a certain degree of
stability in the system is desireable when you are going
to be interfacing with a number of customers, some of
whom know little or nothing about computers.

As a specific example, I didn't have access to a dial-in
terminal for about four or five months. When I again was
able to enter the Urbana system, it took about an hour

before I had re-familiarized myself with the system, despite
the notes on changes that U of I sends us. In a general
user environment, that sort of thing may not be tolerable.
As I said, that is for higher management levels than me to
decide.

My first question, concerning updates and transportability,
I consider answered. While the answers do not have the
degree of specificity I would like, and there are a number
of practical/political problems to be worked out, the
answers are about as good as they're going to get, at
least for a while.

Four or five months is a long time to be away from PLATO
in its formative period! I assume that most of the
changes that were unfamiliar had to do with the author-mode 
page and related transportation. Since there are still
less than a thousand PLATO terminals in the world, it
seems clear that such major benefits as the cleaned-up
author-mode operations surely outweigh the inconvenience
to a few authors, such as happened to you. PLATO is still 
very small! And there absolutely must be considerable
further change, particularly in the "instructor mode".

We do not however dispute the need for stability in many
areas, particulary in being able to run lessons on all 
systems.

---------- response 10
  02/26     13.32     black       cdcc

It occurs to me that it might be a Good Idea to explicitly
state some facts that are probably clear from the context
of my previous notes.  This is known as CYA.

1. I have no control or influence over what CDC does with
   it's PLATO system. I am but a humble CAI developer/
   programmer with some aquaintance with the system
   structure and personnel (both of them). Hence, I can
   make no predictions or promises about what CDC will be 
   doing with PLATO, and any opinions are mine, and not
   necessarily in accord with company policy.

2. I am not advocating that PLATO be frozen at any
   arbitrary level, or at all. I merely bring up the fact
   that, as an R¬+D system, the U of I system is usually
   not going to be quite the same as any of  the others,
   which can make a difference in system communications
(cont.)

---------- response 11
  02/26     13.43     black       cdcc

   and lesson transportability. A particular example of
   differences between the two systems is that CDC PLATO
   runs on a different operating system that U of I PLATO.
   Since, according to the rumors and impressions I get,
   CDC has every intention of continuing to run under
   KRONOS' the two systems are not necessarily inter-
   changeable on the machine language level.

3. This means that it will probably always take a certain
   amount of time to incorporate U of I changes into the 
   CDC system. I don't expect this to be a major problem,
   but it exists.

4. Finally, while I am not and cannot speak for CDC,
   someone should mention the fact that there is a 
   possibility that CDC may not want some features of the
   U of I system, or vice versa.

Two places where STOP1 does not work:
1) After typing the name of a person whom you wish to page.
   This could concievably "stick" a person in term-talk if
   a backout occurred.
2) After a "no" judgement when the course is typed in
   on initial entry. This often makes it confusing for

The important thing is not that the system has run 18 hrs
on a given day. but that it run 18 hrs EVERY day. The
4,300 terminals hours is impressive, but only a little
over half of the signons are usually in student mode,
and of the ones in student mode not all are in fact
students. This means that the system had ca. 2000
terminal hours of student use. But in one class
alone this semester I have CANCELLED that many student
contact hours because of system failures.

The probability that a class would be interrupted by a
failure last month was 0.28, this is worse than conventional
instruction by a factor of ca. 10ˆ3. You have a long way
to go Paul.

Paul's point was that we ran for 18 hours, HALLELULAH!!!!,
not that everything is now perfect.

As for you cancelling 2000 hours in ONE class alone this
semester, I don't believe it. Since January 6, there have
been 35 week days. That means you must have cancelled
57 student contact hours EVERY day. Devoting 8 terminals
exclusively to one class, that would mean that for 7 hours
every day, 8 terminals were unavailable. Things have been
pretty awful, but not _that_ awful.

I think several people have missed the point of Paul's
original note. It was not to announce that we had been up
for 18 continuous hours. 18 hours is not even near the
record for continuous PLATO operation, and certainly no one
here at CERL is in the mood to brag about our system's
stability.

Rather, the point was to indicate the extent of usage we
can expect when the system is reasonably stable. Based on
that day's data, we expect an average of 4300/850 or
about 5 hours of use per terminal installed. This is a
marked increase from our past PLATO IV experience. On the
other hand, do you suppose we will ever equal the level of
utilization of PLATO III?

assuming that is not a rhetorical question, the answer
is a resounding YES when (and perhaps ONLY when):

a) terminals all over the network are not locked up
on evenings, night, and weekends

b) terminals are located in such a way that using
them at night (ie,, being in the neighborhood) is not
a frank suicidal gestore)(consider the med center
chicago campus for example)

c) other plato resources: disc space, processing time,
and (for a while not a problem) ecs, are plentifully
available... (perhaps consultant services as well)

i feel (arbitrarily perhaps) that well located terminals
on a reliable system with adequate resources could be used
as much as 4000 hours a year with a little scheduling--
appx. 11 hours/day on the average, 7 days7wk, 365 days/yr.

re stan/chem's reaponse:
        system crashes interrupting experimental sessions
have caused me bitter disappointment on several occasions
recently...so i can appreciate how you must feel when
whole classes suffer disruption...repeatedly.
        BUT let's give credit where credit is due...the
systems software people shed blood...for months...and
SUCCESSFULLY to overcome the major problems occasioned
by the sudden addition of so many new terminals...software
crashes are now rather rare.
        the crashes now are almost all hardware and, i
understand, mostly inevitable effects of the addition of
the new (hurrah) ecs and associated machinery. this does
not make the effects any more tolerable...but it's not
anything paul and his associates can fix. they are doing
a magnificent job and have earned the right to a little
satisfaction in their achievement.

        A special command performs the function of
replacing shift codes and other such codes with spaces.
Though the command is presently not system restricted, it
has never been announced (and consequently can go away or
be changed without notice).

        I dont see how this is an example of the "great"
-wherex- controversy.

---------- response 4
  02/22     12.11     tom s       reading

There is a special command called -clean- that takes
care of the shift, fonts, and other codes that do
not display caharacters.

Since it is not advertised, it shouldn't be relied on
to be available forever.

---------- response 5
  02/22     15.29     steve       cu

     Sorry, the -wherex- thing was in reference to the 
fact that -showa- doesn't update -wherex- until the next
timeslice, so if one uses the two together in showing
shifted characters or access chars,etc, it is very
possible to get unwanted spaces in the output.
     I would request that people making comments on
a note with references check the references before
commenting. There seems to have been a rash of
misunderstood notes recently.

But seriously, so long as the telephones do not ring at

Even in my office, I don't get phone calls at night unless
I happen to see the blinking light. The many authors who
use room 257 are at the same disadvantage.

I think it would be resonable for the operators to call

---------- note 308 ;rdraw?
  02/23     15.57     michael       english

My tests seem to indicate that the continued -rdraw- command
does not work at all. It draws lines between the origin
and the first point of the continued rdraw rather than
between the terminal point of the prior rdraw and the
first point of the second. At first I thought that this
was a bug in the way ID and SS generated code; it is not.
It is a bug in the way system handles continued -rdraw-
commands. After talking to people I find that it is a
known but undocumented bug.

Is it going to be fixed? If not, what is one to do with
the command? I would really like to use it to create some
size-able, rotate-able maps, but cannot until fixed.

---------- response 1
  02/23     16.13     b sherwood       s

That behavior may be undesirable in your application, but
it is not a "bug". As stated in aids and elsewhere, after
an -rdraw- we return to the previous origin, which permits
easy superpositioning of different pieces of a picture,
all relative to an origin. Therefore the continued -rdraw-,
(e.g., "rdraw ;50,100") is equivalent to asking to draw
from 0,0.

---------- response 2
  02/23     16.50     michael       english

Then I assume one must insert -at- statements between
regular -rdraw- commands to avoid results such as I
obtained in "michael6"?

     Unfortunately, inserting -at-'s before each -rdraw-
won't do any good if you are thinking of using the
-where- variables, since they too are set to the origin
of the rdraw.
     Is there some possibility of getting a set of
system variables that give us the LAST POSITION PLOTTED
for -rdraw-'s? Please/

         Steve Lionel

---------- response 5
  02/24     00.18     michael       english

I finally begin to see the light.....

Seeing as how the continued rdraw command is virtually
useless for almost everything, I wonder why rdraw was
not originally created so as to use an -origin- type
command to set its base, thus leaving the -where- variables
free so that a continued rdraw would be a useful feature.
As it now stands, to draw any complicated figure with
rdraw involves repeating a set of coordinates needlessly.

---------- response 6
  02/24     08.19     b sherwood       phys

Maybe what you are really asking for is -grotate-. As
I mentioned earlier, -rdraw- was created to simplify the
drawing of relatively-located pieces of pictures. A good
example would be the several -rdraw-s required to build up
a Chinese character. All strokes must be relative to the
same origin, set with an -at- command. I would you explain 
what kind of picture gives you trouble? Could have
thought that for a map you might have different -rdraw-s
for different countries or states and could position them
anywhere with -at-, When does the "continuation"come in?

---------- response 7
  02/24     09.13     michael       english

When the map is complicated, you have to use more tags than
fit in one rdraw legally. What I want is in the lesson
mentioned earlier in this series -- and to get it I had
to use non-continued rdraws with the last point of an
rdraw being repeated as the first point of a continued
rdraw. True, a -grotate- function would also be an answer.
Any possibility of that?

---------- response 8
  02/24     11.25     judy       pso

I can't see that having to re-state the last point to start
a new -rdraw- destroys its usefulness. I have an -rdraw-ed
picture which is a whole block long. It -size-s and
-rotate-s and relocates like a charm.

---------- response 9
  02/24     11.28     b sherwood       phys
And having to repeat one point out of 60 isn't much
typing.......

We would like eventually to have -grotate-, as well as 
a few other goodies for consistency (such as a 2-arg
-size- command).

Possibly DATA to replot, since that too is becoming

Was staring at some code of mine this morning and I
discovered something rather peculiar(at least to me). If
an -inhibit blanks- command is placed before an arrow and
a -jkey- of some sort is initialized after the arrow (which
is the only place I know of you can place such a statement),
and this code is executed, the inhibit blanks only works for
next and NOT any jkeys which are listed. This is a little
inconvenient since if you are doing a -storea- on something
then you end up with unwanted blank responses. Is this the
way that it is supposed to work and if not, is this a
feasible idea to initiate?

In the case that this inconsistency is too deeply embedded
in the structure of TUTOR to change, or if it's a low

The code will double-check an -inhibit blanks-, since
entering just a space will make the inhibit decide
that the response isn't qualified as blank. As
someone once suggested when the command came out, perhaps
it should be called -inhibit null-.

Since you put in an explicit -jkey-, TUTOR gives you
the response if the key is not NEXT.  The reason for
this "inconsistency" is that the normal reason for defining
a -jkey- is that you want those other keys to initiate
some SPECIAL action. Presumably you are checking the
value of "key" to decide what you are going to do, which
may include throwing away null character strings or not.

Agreed that this should 8e well-documented; don't know
whether it is.

Rick, I know I could double-check the inhibit statement
but that is not what I intended to point out. Also if the
jkey is a marker to check for other keys to initiate the
SPECIAL action stated, then why couldn't these keys also be
flagged to allow the -inhibit- to work for all judging cases
or for all cases where more than one key can initiate the 
same processes?

          Whansen:

          It is indeed possible to insert an -arrow- by use
of the -join- command. When an -arrow- is executed, TUTOR
remembers the sequence of -join-, -do-s, etc., that led to
the -arrow-. This means that TUTOR can find the -arrow-
again when it has to (i.e., when scanning judging commands,
and when searching for the next -arrow-). I have tried a 
couple of test units, where some judging commands are with
the -arrow- in a -join-ed unit and some are in the main
unit. Even when there were regular commands following a
-specs- they were executed as they should be. I believe
that a -join- will always act just like text insertion if
the judging sequence ends with an -endarrow- and there are
no -goto-s or -jump-s in the -join-ed unit.

     Ok, here is a use for it!

     I am writing a lesson to teach the LISP programming
language. In it, I need to judge LISP s-expressions
to see if they are correct, but since the student
can put blanks in wierd places, etc., I have a unit
with about 12 -putd-'s that I must -join- for every
arrow where s-expression judging is necessary. Now,
all I need do is:

iarrow putter

     at the beginning of each unit, and I'm free from
having to put -join-'s everywhere!

One can even put an -iarrow- command in an -imain- unit

One might use -iarrow- to supply

force    long

put      .=q

I don't really have anything against the new command (except
adding possibly unnecessary complextity to the language), but 
I don't see that it really gains that much since people who
need fancy processing of a particular type at many arrows
could set up a unit:?
unit    arrowp(arropos)
arrow   arropos
putd    .=q $$etc?
and the use a *join arrowp(2005)* to get the same effect
with essentially the same coding effort. (You don't even
have to remember to turn off iarrow.)?
     I assume my operation is less efficient from a system
viewpoint, but it seems (to me) to be at least as efficient
from a programmer viewpoint.

A use of more general interest is for addition of data-
keeping features to a lesson which has already been written
and for which the standard data-keeping options (such as
"area") are insufficient. Prior to iarrow, addition of
such featues after the lesson had been produced were a
real hassle.

Al,
  I share your feelings that data collection is a pain
to add after the lesson has been written. Wouldn't
an  -ispecs- round out the capabilities of adding
such routines easily, without dictating the details
of the lesson (ie. standard specs options throughout 
the lesson)? It seems that one would usually like to
collect data after judging, but I don't see a way to do that
with -iarrow-.

This is a general suggestion:
        It appears to me that a conditional arrow
        command or procedure would be most useful
        in programming variable display techniques
        which would optimize screen usage. The current
        arrow command severely limits the ability,
        for example, to dedicate the top half of the
        screen for updated, dynamically displayed
        information, and the bottom half which would
        allow for student input.

     It might be nice to have students allowed to
read "notes", but experience here has shown that students
unfamilliar with PLATO, tend to leave incomprehensible
and sometimes ridiculous notes when given the chance.
     When we first got PLATO here, and we were only
using author records, a professor interested in PLATO
left a General Note which was some gibberish addressed
to his son, who was with him at the time. Notefiles
tend to get used like bathroom walls, filled with
graffitti. Examples like this occur often even now
from courses who just give someone author records, without
adequate guidance.

which is, of course, the usual way of doing it. However,
with vertical segments, the statement has the effect of

very bad PROGRAMMING practice, because you cannot

Authors at the University of Connecticut Health Center
have developed a router, an on-line router editor, and
a package of data support software which we feel may be
uniquely suited to the needs and interests of course
directors on site 'network'.

The router has unique capabilities in terms of setting
priorities of lesson use within a location, and in keeping
detailed records of student-lesson interactions.

The router--at about 1400 words ecs--and the support
materials can accomodate users at up to 10 locations. We
are interested in finding 5 to 7 additional groups who
might find this router useful for their courses.

        Right, In order for the disk copy of your notes
to be updated properly, you must either press NEXT and
reach the 'no more notes page', or press BACK while reading
a note. Pressing SHIFT-STOP before you reach the "no
more notes" page will NOT update the disk copy of the notes
directory. This situation is hard to change, and as pointed
out, is desirable under certain circumstances.

Will the day ever come when the code produced

If there is some sound reason why this can't be done,
great. If the reason is, as rumor has it, that there
is rivalry between the two system programmers responsible
for these two fine options, then that's a little silly.

Simply put, I think that code produced by SD should be
able to be SS'ed. Thanks in advance for explanation
of why it cannot.

Anyway, if the code produced by SD/ID is condensable and 
works, then it seems to me that SS is at fault if it can't
un-format it. Marshall will probably have something to
say about that. I mean, Marshall my friend will have
something to say about it. If you can generate stuff in

It's interesting that a program like services, which can

unformatted) finds the following statement so hard to
unformat:

draw    1016;1031;skip;1216;1231

due to the "skip" in the middle of the line.

I had a block full of display commands that I needed
crunched together. Since service seems to do that
fairly well, I typed in SS999; however, service got
stuck on the fourth command (a draw) because it didn't
know what to do with the number (?) "skip."

that -student- already has the following message -(blah)-.

   If in writing a note to all students the router states
that -student- already has a note and you would like to see
it before overwriting, just press BACK, press option 1 to
send a note to an individual, and enter students name. PLATO
will then say that there is already a note there and will
show you the note. If you decide to overwrite the message
press BACK and attempt the original option (to all students)
If message to that individual student is to be retained
then you must selectively send the message to the remainder
of the students. With a large course this would be very
tedious, so an option to skip sending a message to a
particular student when sending a general message would be
desireable.

You can skip the student who has the note by pressing
NEXT so you don't need to send it to every student
individually if you don't want to overwrite.?
However, th feature requested in the original note is
really needed since the only suggestion to get around it
was extremely tedious (would involve much paging thru
records and retyping of the message, not to mention
disk accesses and cpu).

HOO-RAY FOR MIDDEN!
Authors of interterminal lessons have needed a foolproof
ghost-killer for a long time, and here is Midden planning
just such a feature! (If there is one user in the lesson,
and more than one common area showing a person, something
is wrong and we can kill the ghost.) Thank you, thank you,
thank you for your work! Keep at it!

The aborted flag is necessary...
My previous note was to mention about the second problem
of knowing whether the common was just read from disk.
(in otherwords are you the first one to condense the lesson)

For the particular application I had in mind, the ¬$ of
people in lesson flag would do the trick. But for applica-
tions where a common is shared, it would not.

Seems to me, in earlier discussions, that there was a
conceptual problem involving such a flag and the read-in
error page, but I can't remember the details.

but if there are more than 1 users, and
"something is wrong", you still have to check for
ghosts via -press-command...(you don't know which
one of the "wrongs" is the ghost).
in other words. i don't see how this improves the 
situation that much..

Marshall, Warner did't mention games. It is just that
you think all interterminal lessons are games.

John, the previous implementation suggested for telling
you if you were the only one in the lesson was to give you
a flag that said you condensed the lesson. The problem
with that suggestion was that if you sat on the condense
error page for any length of time, someone else could come
in, and then you would go in, with the lesson possibly
automatically reinitializing common when you entered.

Tatsuoka, the idea was to reinitialize common whenever
the first person entered the lesson. If you never mess
up your own common, and the only way it gets messed up
is when the system crashes, then reinitializing when
the first person came back in should clear up your problem.

Even authors who use their REAL names should put their

they wish to receive comments. A phone number is often

---------- note 484 SD-stop1
  02/27     14.58     warner       iu
When in SD-mode, if you wish to look at a large display,
but realize somewhere in the middle that it is taking too
much time. the usual action is to press STOP1 and be
thrown out to parts unknown. Usually during these times
of high CPU usage, one can STOP1 out of the condense
queue before damage is done.
Howwever, while plotting the drawing in SD-mode, especially
when autobreak slows down the operation of SD, STOP1 merely
breaks through autobreak and does nothing more. This has two
bad effects: it forces the user to wait until the display
is plotted, and causes him to burn up CPU time 10 no
purpose completing the display he does not want. Can this
be fixed so that STOP1 while drawing either returns to the
block display or to the condense queue?

Time and Date....3:15 p.m., Friday, February 28, 1975

Topic............Latency As a Measure of Errorless
                  Paired-Associates Learning Via A

Could we have an English translation of the title of
the seminar?

---------- response 2
  02/27     18.25     gilpin       peer

"latency" is a fancy word for the time it takes to type
in an answer and press NEXT. although it is easy to measure
latencies in CAI, there has mostly been little success in
finding uses for latency information, either in instruction-
al research or in real-life instruction. // "paired-asso-
ciates" is a fancy term for materials like foreign language
vocabulary or arithmetic 'facts'. the usual way of follow-
ing the progress of learning of such materials is to record
the decrease in proportion of errors with practice. //
in the seminar i will discuss methods of doing away (mostly)
with errors in paired-associates drill, and using latency
information to measure progress. only very preliminary
data are in hand, but the methods appear powerful for ana-
lyzing different drill techniques.

Do you mean a technique for separating out typing delays
due to poor typing from typing delays due to time spent
thinking?

---------- response 5
  02/28     13.56     gilpin       peer

the method does sort out those things, but that is not
its main purpose. its main purpose is to compare different
drill paradigms to determine which is most effective.
the "errors" mentioned are not those where the learner
thinks the right thing and types the wrong one (altho
of course those occur occasionally), but those where he
thinks the wrong thing and types _that_

---------- note 497 -area-
  02/27     17.08     chabay       s

A change made to the functioning of the -area- command
early in December caused a minor problem with the time data
in area summaries in certain cases. This problem affected
only areas in which a student generated an "incomplete"
area summary, then resumed work in the same area of the
same lesson. The problem was that the elapsed time in the
area was not added correctly when the student re-entered
the area; the result was that the time shown for such an
area was longer than the actual time the student spent
there.
This problem has been corrected and the correction is in
effect on the present prime-time version of the system.

---------- response 2
  02/27     17.49     celia       pso

To get one, you request a new lesson space, and ask
maureen to make it a dataset. What it is is just
a whole lesson space made up of variables that you can
treat like common or storage variables. A dataset is
really only useful if you have a HUGE amount of information
to store.
The aids write-up, I'll admit, is not very englishtening,
but will be expanded in the not-too-far future.

as was discussed at a recent meeting of the campus users.
it is frequently possible for students to access sample
when they are allowed to enter lessons which normally
can be reached from sample... they simply do a term
'sample' and they are off! this messes up some data
keeping regally because one has no way to keep track of
what provinces they are exploring!

it was suggested and i'd like to pass on, that authors
who have lessons which have (or are linked to other
files which have) jumpouts to sample, please put in
suitable code (using the "from" command) to be sure
the student originated from lesson "sample" !!

  It would seem that any author who has a jumpout
to sample AND has discussed the use of the lesson
for instructional purposes could be persoaded
to impliment your idea without any problem.

   On the other hand, if I were to use a lesson for
instructional puposes without the author's knowlege
I would, 1) have no right to expect any particular behavior
from that lesson and 2) may be in danger of breaking

     how would an author keep track of
     whether a student entered a lesson from *sample*
     if *sample* itself is thrice removed? i.e,, *sample*
     often times does a jumpout to a curriculum index
     lesson, which does a jumpout to a sub-curriculum
     index, and so on. this would seem to be an
     especially difficult problem if there were no
     central control over those lessons...

    I just discovered the m and M options in the editor. I
set m to replace 'do' with 'DO', in a FORTRAN lesson on DO
loops ( Of course I had to skip a lot of tutor -do-
statements, but the author had written 'do' in a lot of
-write- statements where he should have used 'DO'. ) .
Everything was great, until the x-search caught a 'Do',
and M replaced it with 'd<'. I would have been delighted
to be able to replace both 'd0' and 'Do' with 'DO',
but what happened really suprised me. What should happen?

Richard Montanelli

---------- response 1
  02/28     10.57     k gorey       o
    What apparently happened here is that the search looked
and saw a Do, (SHIFT)do, and replaced the do with
a (SHIFT) d (SHIFT) o. The code then looked like
(SHIFT) (SHIFT) d (SHIFT) o, which is dO because one
shift cancelled out the other.

   The question is then; Is the overhead that is needed for
the check on double shift codes really worth it?

---------- response 2
  02/28     13.00     berger       users

No, kevin, the question is really whether someone
wants the double shift codes...since this option
works consistently, and touches none of the code,
other than that which you specify. I think it is
advantageous to leave this as it is. I'd hate to
modify some random data, and have this feature modify
shift codes which really have some meaning to me.

While searching through lesson "traficsim" for
all occurrences (is that spelled right?) of the word
"what", the X-search from the author mode page found
everything up to block h of part 2 and then just hung
for 3 minutes. It didn't give me a "complete" flag and
NEXT and BACK didn't work, so I gave up with a STOP1.
There are no occurrences of "what" in blocks i-n of
part 2 of the lesson.

I used the "only condensed source" option and typed

That is because you can have the following calcs command,

           a^2+sqrt(b),sin(a),sin(b),etc,etc,etc
where every value in all lines can be assigned.
When, say, a+b=24,c is set to a.
This is a meaningful option and should be kept in,
But perhaps "aids" can be rewritten to show an example
of a multi-line -calcs- or -calcc-?

I deal far more efficiently with the business at hand,
waste far less time in trying to commence a project, and

       There is a new lesson available about the Special
Theory of Relativity. It is called "relative". The lesson
is about 2/3 finished and contains material on the Time
Dilation and the Lorentz Contraction. The approach is a
kinematic one, using elemeniary principles of vector add-
ition of velocities.

       The lesson has a notesfile acessable from the Main

A new option for the editor:
        UPDATE
It would return all your newly made text to disk
so you would be safe if PLATO crashed.
Ideally, the operation should be transparent to the user.
Otherwise the command might do a condense,
or it could press BACK twice (to return to the
author page) and then NEXT1 (to return to where you
left off).

   If you are on the block directory display, then all
editing changes have been written safely to the disk.
(Not all people realize this, and perhaps it should be
advertised more widely or described in the editor's help).
I think most people find it easy enough to press BACK
once (or twice) to reach that display without introducing
any more special keys or having to type the word "update"
or something else. Of course this sort of thing might
get more consideration if the system continues to go
up and down as much as it has recently--but we (obviously?)
do not consider the recent behavior acceptable nor do we
expect it to continue much longer.

apparently many people are under the impression that
your work is saved only after you condense it...

    A PDP-11 here running BASIC doesn't save your work
unless you type SAVE, UPDATE, REPLACE, COMPILE, and/or RUN
and apparently the same thing goes for many other systems
that people work on before (or at the same time as) PLATO..

  This just might reduce the CPU load a bit due to less
unneeded condensing...

When you press LAB for responses, and then press

RE: CONDITIONAL JUMPOUT
It seems to me that the scrapping of the form of the
jumpout 'jumpout retles,retunit' where retles and
retunit are n-type variables whose values are determined
with a 'calc' in the lesson from which the user jumped
to the current lesson is a bad decision.
     The above form of the jumpout is _much_ easier
to use than a long conditional jumpout of the apparently
preferred form. This is especially true if you want
the jumpout t occur in a large number of units and lessons
and would like to return to those units and lessons.
     I , for one, would like to see 'jumpout retles,retunit'
with variable arguments continue to be available as a
_viable_ alternative to the other seemingly preferred form.

Maybe you need to rethink your interconnection problems.
Except for rather specialized computer-ish programming,
instructional lessons really should not have ANY jumpouts
at all! Explicit jumpouts in a lesson prevent instructors
from using such lessons in a modular way to put together
a course. (An exception would be a lesson on a topic which
takes so long to present that it is spread over two
lesson spaces, in which case the first lesson presumably
ends with an explicit jumpout to the next part. In this
case the two physical lessons really form one whole.)

Could you describe why you need lots of jumpouts in the
first place ? Maybe then we could help you solve the
problem, rather than try to retain an unfortunate
jumpout syntax.

this is to support professor sherwood in his point of
view-- jumpouts under program control make it a nightmare
to design curricula.

there are a number of specific objections which can be
made:

* if the jumpout fails, the student may be looking at
a confusing display

* it becomes impossible for the manager of the curriculum
to keep a record of where the student is and for how long

* students can gain access by devious routes to lessons
which are not a part of the desired curriculum-- great fun
and profit maybe, but taking the assignment of resources
out of the hands of the manager!

certainly some need to jumpout from lessons, but let's
minimize that activity as much as possible...use indices!

If Einstein had observed here that the universe could be

classical physics, how many admonitions to bone up on his
calculus would he have recieved??

  In the good old PLATO III days, we had a couple of stock
answers to all requests/complaints about the system:
        Why would anybody ever want to do that?
        That would bog down the system !
 It seems them days ain't gone forever yet.

  I think in the case of the new jumpout format, a
simple repeat (this was argued extensively some time ago)
of the rationale for the change and perhaps an estimate of
the time of the final changover would be adequate.

Since lesson space seems to be in short supply, it would
seem very handy to me if there were an easy way to store
a lesson for future use on a cassette tape. This would
free up lesson space not currently in use for the
development of other lessons.
Has any work been done on this ? Perhaps this could
be accomplished by converting the lesson from source
to common and using another lesson to "read out" the
lesson to be stored via the -ext- command to a cassette
in octal code. When the author wanted to re-insert
the lesson in the lesson space, perhaps the opposite
procedure could be used. Is anyone working on anything
like this? Does anyone else agree it would be handy?

Therefore, if you were editing a lesson just before using
the X-search option, n1 should contain the last lesson you
edited. I think this is better than assigning n1 with the
first lesson in the lesson list which will probably produce
more confusion than it's worth.

This threat to the life of PLATO is not restricted
by any means to your domain. It is being spread anywhere
there are friendships (and other relationships) between
authors. What goes on in other courses' note files
is none of your business. Personally, I do delete
all of these letters and I do not believe that any
author that does not is being non-productive. As a matter
of fact the time it takes to resend this note to
another signon is certainly less than the time it takes
to write a note in general interest notes........
  How much man-time and disk space is wasted with garbage
general interest notes?

It seems that it would take just a little thought for
people to realize that the cain letter is basically
a very inefficient and unreliable method of doing
anything, whether it be spreading cheer, or getting
rich quick: (1) The system resources are not
growing as fast as the space required for all those
notes (2) soon we will all be spending all our time
sending the notes( 3125 authors is comparable
with the number of active authors on the system) (3) the
original chain note conveys relatively little information
when compared with the amount that could be sent if
everyone sent one short personalized note to another, with
perhaps one general note for everyone to read.

Anyways, thanks to whoever started the letter; this

(not all at once)
well here's a _rough_ estimate of the number of authors:
lesson -authors- has about 26 blocks with about 50
names in each block. 50?26=1300. Of course there
may be many other author records not listed in authors,
and I don't know what : can receive pnotes. But for
our purposes 1300 ¬n?¬n 3125 = 5ˆ5
  So the chain note under discussion asks one to send
the note to 5 more people. If everyone were to resend
their note 5 times as soon as they received it, by the
time that note has gone through 5 cycles, there would
be a copy for every (approx) author on the system.
But some popular people would receive more than one
copy, and others would not have seen it yet.
  Now if we knew how fast the average person resends
the note, and what : get resent, and a few more important
facts, we could calculate the time it would take to
fill all pnotes!!

THE number one lesson used by our neophyte platoers,
I can't imagine what people would do without it to
try different language lessons, etc. , with a minimum
of fuss.
     It seems to me that if there are funny jumpouts in
lessons accessed by sample, those lessons should be removed
from the index. There is NO excuse for this action! Plato
is not the author-oriented system many suppose it to be.

The game jumpout was corrected by Prof. Maggs last Thursday
so it is site restricted. I think Prof. Maggs has a very
valid point in his response to the action taken on -sample-
and I hope that after 24 hours, the site directors will
take it upon themselves to make their own regulations and
-sample- can proceed as it was. Initially, last year, mult-
iples were inhibited, but were allowed after a month or so
of operation of the program.
        -sample- is intended for Plato demonstrations, and
for new users browsing through a few lessons, not for a path
through the system. That is the reason complete indexes
of subject areas are discouraged.

If you restrict "sample" to authors only, then we have
to give everybody who wants to try its lessons an
"author" signon. If we do this at N.U., we'll for sure
find everybody immediately back in the games, so we
desperately need to allow multiples to use "sample"!!
We have lots of kids each quarter who use "sample"
to explore specific subject areas -- if it's games

  03/04     11.42     friedman       csa

To answer "how do others handle the jumpout to sample":?
There is code in each cs lesson to save the name of the
lesson which invoked the cs lesson. If invoked by sample,
it will store that. (We don't depend on jumpout return
because there are utility lessons, such as cscomments,
which if used would foul up the use of jumpout return.)
Then when the user -term-s to leave the lesson, whether
via -term sample- or otherwise, we jumpout to the stored
lesson name. The result is that the only way -term sample-
will exit to sample, is if that's how you entered!?
incidentally, this code needs obsolete jumpouts to work,
which is why I'm a vociferous opponent of the removal of
the present "obsolete" forms of -from- and -jumpout- un-
til and unless replaced with something at least as power-
ful for the above purposes.?
If interested, feel free to peruse lesson cslibrary,
blocks "how to use" and "standard1".

I will agree, that taking the obsolete jumpouts are
an inconvenience, but you can take the lesson name out
of storage, removl a space from a leslist, addl the new
leslist, and jumpout to the leslist pointer....hope
this helps, friedman.

Are you sure there was a backout in those cases? The NIU

a great deal of this recently--and sometimes we have managed
to recover the NIU without starting up again, and sometimes
we have backed everyone out and started up again. I would
appreciate hearing of "pauses" or "backouts" like this.

   To beat the dead horse once more: it is NOT a search
and replace. It replaces occurrences in one line only.
This restricted form of operation makes the procedure
feasible; it was not until Kevin Gorey simulated such
a feature and the concept was discussed in detail that it
was realized that a general search and replace was not
necessary nor even desirable in most cases.
  As with other features (like the lesson X search), it
is not because of programming difficulty nor of nastiness
or unresponsiveness on the part of system programmers that
such features are not incorporated immediately. We
simply must spread some of the burden between human and
computer so as to maintain the rapid response time which
is one of the most essential components of this system.

The recent chain letter craze suggests that it may be time
to implement an idea which I have been thinking about for
some time. This is to allow a course director to zero
the notes directory of someone in the course without
changing that person's codeword. At present, the course
director can clear the codeword and then enter under the
signon to change the note, or remove and reinstate the
signon, leaving it with an arbitrary codeword for safety
and wait for the person affected to come to him. Why
not just give the course director the option to zero
the note directory of someone who leaves too much junk in

        All the course director has to do is write the

telling him to get rid of his notes.

  I think the reason most people are hesitant to store notes
in lesson space is because the notes may contain material
that the person does not want other people to see.
  To solve this problem (if anyone is interested) Wrote
a common encrypter, which, given a 10 character password
encrypts the data in common (whatever it might be), NO data
is stored with the common, therefore it is impossible to
obtain the password unless someone is watching. It will be
necessary, however to convert the source block to common.
An example of this is in lesson joekwk, block 'crypt' if
anyone is interested, I could turn it into a routine that
would display the notes properly, so the common to source
conversion would not be necessary.
  Due to space considerations, I can not gaurantee it's
availability for -use-, so I would suggest copying it.

   Sometimes it is possible for a lesson to become

to delete such entries from the catalog so that there are

You can change the lesson description in the catalog
to "obsolete lesson", "xxxxxxxxxx", or something
similar if a lesson becomes obsolete. It is not possible
to delete entries from the catalog. Information on
lesson completion, scores, etc. stored in a student's
permanent record refers to catalog numbers of lessons;
this information would become hopelessly garbled if it
were possible to change lesson entries in the catalog.

---------- note 141 sample
  03/04     11.53     tebby       pso
I am going to restore the use of program -sample- to all
Plato users. The restrictions placed on the program yester-
day created the desired furor and have helped to point up
the fact that many sites are still not using the Plato
system properly.

What is -sample-:
  Program -sample- is not a System" program, but was de-
  designed by me as a service for persons giving Plato demo-
  onstrations and for new or potential users of the Plato
  system.Program -sample- shows a wide variety of lessons
 (not always our best examples) illustrating Plato applic-
 ations and capabilities.

Who is -sample- for:
  -sample- is for potential users who can through its use
  acquaint themselves with instructional capabilities in a
  few days. After that time, production of new Plato lessons
  or serious study of prescribed lessons by students should
  ensue.(cont)

---------- response 1
   03/04     12.01     roper       siu

The problem is that it is still impossible to find
lessons on any given topic because there is no worthwhile
lesson catalog giving type and n_ame=_ of the lesson.
Also, some of the lessons in sample dont't give the name
of the lesson that you are jumping out to! Thus, the
only way you can be sure of getting to it is by actually
going through sample.
How about a real comprehensive lesson catalog?
For instance how about adding lesson _names_ to the present
catalog lesson?
Thanks,
Quetzal

---------- response 2
  03/04     12.03     tebby       pso

  Persons giving demonstrations can use -sample- to access
  lessons or can contact me for lesson names so they can
  make up their own "demo" package. -sample- is, therefore,
  important to instructors and authors, but is not designed
  as a learning tool for students. Unfortunately, the inter-
  connection of Plato IV lessons (without which we could not
  live) has had an unfortunate consequence: students in-
  stead of spending time on assigned lessons have discover-
  ed that they can enter -sample- and they then spend time
  wandering around the lesson file system sometimes ending
  up in programs which should not be accessed at all. The
  Plato system is not quite ready to be a "library of
  learning". Library-like use of the system is one of our
  objectives , but despite 3500+ finished lessons, we are
  not yet ready for any site to use the system in that
  manner.(cont)

  03/04     12.10     tebby       pso

(Unfortunately someone did not wait until I finished my
long note before putting in a response, and so my essay
does not how have continuity).

Suggestions for control of -sample-'s use:
  Many authors of lessons in -sample- have put in checks
  whenever possible in their "jumpout sample" units to
  prohibit returns to -sample- unless the user has entered
  from -sample-. I urge authors of programs in -sample-
  to do this whenever it is practical. I would also like
  to encourage site directors and course directors to
  reconsider the uses of -sample- and use it as it is
  intended.
  Thank you.

roper's question is one which is frequently asked...

there are many problems associated with giving out lesson
names of which a few include:
* student should not be concerned with file names-- those
   can change unpredictably and hard to remember

* the concept of a stable, "published" lesson is important-
if you let people access any lesson at all, they will
frequently get into semi finished and experimental
materials and perhaps get an erroneously bad impression
of plato and cai... people are still unable to separate
the medium from the message

*lesson names and the use of instructional material is
proprietary -- only an author can give you access.

*hopefully all this will be solved before fall by plato's
new published lesson catalog...i hope someone from the
system will add a note about the details of that plan.

reference to see what types of lessons are on the system and
different programming methods...
         A list of programs may cause untold troubles with
everyone wanting to look at all the lessons at inconvenient
times to say nothing of constant lesson revisions.

Roper, when you're in a lesson and you want to know what
the file name is, hit stopi, then press the copy key
on the author page, usually giving you the file name!
BUT -- Hody's comments about unpublished lessons still
apply! Since you cannot depend on the lesson, of what
use is it? It is much more desirable to get in touch with
the author.

Tebby, we are letting our students enter -sample- once
they have finished their assigned lessons. If this
is an improper use of the lesson, I will be glad to remove
it, but it is serving a useful purpose"!

The CS group has taken what is, I know, a minority view
on the subject of giving out lesson names:?
We give our lessons fairly mnemonic names, so that they are
(hopefully) not too hard to remember, and we seldom change
a lesson name. Then we advertise the lesson by its name.
A book has a title, by which it can be found (and read)
in a library catalog. It seems to me that a lesson which
is to be generally available should be accessible by the
same means; and a lesson name comes as close a book title
as anything I can think of. Of course, some don't want the
names of their incomplete lesson known, and I can under-
stand that. However, we even advertise those, but with the
notation that the lesson is complete. ("Scratch file"
names are not advertised.)

As to using the PLATO system in a "library" fashion...
Since we have only one terminal at SIU and the possibility
of getting more in the future depends on factors not in
our hands in makes it nearly impossible to use the system
in any other way. Right now, the terminal is scheduled
for almost every hour that the system is open here.
It takes time to author lesson, and if we have teachers
in here in large numbers trying to write their lessons,
then there will be no time for students to run any lesson
written by anyone anywhere on the PLATO system.
Now if we could get more terminals...

a couple different items than a whole bunch of files for 1
string -- probably a lot of other people are going past that

I agree with TomL, but how about implementing it so that
you return to the choose-a-string page after a search,
then if you want to revise the lesson list, press BACK
or LAB, or something like that.

That way you could enter string after string without
seeing any do-nothing pages. This seems to be the most
common use of X-search (in my experience, at least).

For the occasional instruction, SHIFT/DATA is certainly
preferable to DATA1. If you are going to list on
practically every page, that DATA, DATA1, LAB, and LAB1
are/are not available on that page, then DATA1 is a very
useful abbreviation. It takes 5 spaces less than
SHIFT/DATA and looks much neater.

I think we should try to "agree on a suitable abbreviation
and use it where appropriate. An alternative to DATA1
might be ¬WDATA.

As of several (many?) months ago the high values of formok
were:

60 too many temporaries
61 compile routine error
62 instruction word buffer overflow
63 too many literals
64 error in defined expression
65 error in segment

I don't pretend to know what all the words mean but
"literals" in 63 refers to constants in the expression.
You get formok=63 with thinks like 1+1+1+1+1+...etc.

  Suggestion:
Displace the editor list header (BLOCK= , SPACE= and the
line) randomly up to maybe 16 dots on x and 3 on y.

  The reason i suggest this is because i have noticed
that on older terminals graphics involving large percentages
of dots at the top of the screen tend to be slightly
distorted. The effect can even be noticed on new
terminals that have been in use for only a short time,
if a significant percentage of their time is spent in
the editor, by going into testor and doing a full screen,
The negative of the header can be seen without much problem.

arguments, you are just calling with extras. This allows
you to do nifty things like -calc-ing stuff in a -jump-
like most of my other programming practices, but....

My point was just that...that in the case of having zero
arguments, you have mre arguments in the do than you have
on the unit...this, it seems to me, is inconsistent, and
mentioned in Aids?

I always supposed you _could_ do this:

do       name(arg1,arg2,arg3)
**
unit     name(arg1,arg2,arg3,arg4)
(fewer args in the do)

BUT not this:
do       name(arg1,arg2,arg3,arg4)
**
unit     name(arg1,arg2,arg3)
(more args in the do)

SO a construction like this should be illegal:
do       name(arg1,arg2)
**
unit     name

Right?

I'm not sure if this should be a general note or
not, but here tis.
        A guy I ran into has a job for someone who is fam-
iliar with spitbol, a subset of snobal. He needs someone
to program a "computer-on-a-chip"; for what purpose I
don't know. This would be a one shot deal. Once you
finish, you're out of a job.
        Of you are interested, you can call him (his name

    Gee...I'm familiar with SPITBOL (a _SUPERSET_ of
SNOBOL4). and I can't see how it would be worth anyone's
time and effort to attempt to implement it on anything
smaller than the 360 series it was designed for.
     SPITBOL's main feature is its incredible speed, and
character manipulation. While I concede that it's probably
possible to write a SPITBOL compiler in the 8080 language.
I find it as unrealistic as PLATO on a HP-65.
     The Illinois Institute of Technology developed
SPITBOL. why not give them a buzz and talk it over.
SPITBOL is a really nice language, my favorite in fact, but
it would be useless without its speed.

     For further information, the Intel 8080 is a
"computer on a chip" microprocessor. It has an instruction
set vaguely similar to the PDP-8, but is MUCH slower!

---------- response 4
  03/05     19.14     carter       comm

   Just in the interest of completeness, it should be
noted the the "speed " of a computer is dependent on
many more factors than the memory cycle time and number
of cycles per instruction. (PLATO is a good illustration
here). The MITS people cite cases where an 8080 can
outperform much costlier minis with less flexible i/o.
In summary, the speed is application dependent to a high
degree.
    I agree that a spitbol compiler for an 8080 amy be
overly ambitious. However, if one has the memory (machine)
and the determination (human) why not?

---------- response 5

I talked to the fellow, and he wants a cross-assembler
for the INTEL 8080 (preferably written in SPITBOL for
transfer to the DEC10 which can run it directly) which
punches object code onto paper tape. He also seems to
want to find someone to program in this assembly language.

P.S. SPITBOL is my favorite also, although Burroughs
6700 ALGOL comes very, very close....

---------- response 5
  03/05     18.06     blomme       s

   Each disk pack currently has room for 2460 (410 cylinders
? 6 spaces per cylinder) ONE part (14 block) files. It
is planned in the near future to convert to 7 blocks per
part to get at some currently wasted space. We will be
able to get 13 (not 12) of these size files per cylinder.
(This is planned to be basically invisible to the user.
except that your current one part files would become
two of the new 7 block parts)
   For completeness: each block consists of 5 sectors =
322 words; a cylinder is composed of 19 tracks of 24
sectors each. So a cylinder has 19?24=456 sectors=456/5
=91 1/5 blocks. The new 7 block allocation scheme will
permit 13 spaces per cylinder (13?7=91) with only 1 sector
(1/5 block) waste.

I have always visualized a disk pack as similar to a
stack of records. Does this mean there are 410 records
in the conceptual stack?

The disk packs are about 16 inches in diameter, which
would give a surface area of
    410 ? (8)ˆ2 ? ¬p inchesˆ2 ?

Lemme seeee
   One disk pack holds 2460 1 part (14 block) lessons.
Each disk pack is about 16 inches in diameter which
is ¬p8ˆ2 or 201 square inches per surface...

   If a disk pack were one surface I could divide
201 square inches into 2460 lessons and see that
eah lesson takes about .08 square inches on the disk..

  BUT

   The disk packs we (you) have are multi-platter..
Are there 5,6 or 7 platters to a pack and are both
sides of each platter used or just one side?

---------- response 9
  03/06     11.33     kovara j       cccs

  Both sides of the platter are used, except for the 2
outer surfaces. this gives 20 recording surfaces on a
standard 11 platter disk (which the 844's use).
  It must be remembered however that only about a 5" radius
is coated and only about 4" out of that is actually used.
That is, if it's 100 tpi density, if it's 200 tpi, that
would mean only 2" are used out of the recordinf surface.

 If it's the useable area is considered to lie between
about a 13-15 in radius, then it comes out to;
(-p?15ˆ2-¬p?13ˆ2)?19/2640 = 1,3588
 That 20th surface by the way is used for servo positioning
and clock information (to tell the heads where they are).

Whew..that 15" radius disk is a real whopper, if you will
pardon the expression.

To set it all straight, the disks are about 16" in diameter.
The area = ¬p(8ˆ2-6ˆ2) = 88 sq in per disk surface.
The area per lesson space = (88?19)/2460 = .68

records and destroy 300 reading lessons if they so desired
(I've toyed with the idea myself).

Mike - what you say is true but how often do you edit using
another person's records? I should think the chances that
someone who you know well enough to be using their records
would go into your lesson later and do whatever you were
worried about are pretty slim.

I do realize we would be increasing the possibilities for
foul play but I doubt by very much. For me it would be a
convenience. Anyone else?

Alan -- you say that anyone who knows your password can
change any of your lessons if they want to. This probably
means that you leave your lesson change code on your
records when you leave the system.

Because of the possibility of just such a misfortunate
occurrence, many people (most of the ones I've seen, as
a matter of fact) change their security code to garbage
before they leave the system. True, it makes it a little
less convenient to alter your lesson, but it makes your
sign-on password almost useless to anyone else, since
they don't automatically have your lesson change code.

Also, the "last edited" page checks to find the postion
in course records. If your course gets altered so that
you are no longer in the same alphabetical position,
you still have to type in your security code. Also,
whoever has your old position can do editing!

I cannot help but agree with 'Orpheus' that this is NOT
a democracy and therefore I will not attempt to vote.
However this is a forum for opinion and _reason_ and that I'm
willing to offer.
First, it seems to me that there really is no need to fear
that everybody on the system is out to destroy your lesson.
If you happen to give someone your change code or use
another persons sign-on to change something in your lesson
it is obvious that you trust that person and therefore
you have nothing to fear from him.
Second if someone were to get your sign on password then
you have been careless and they could just as easily
gotten your lesson change code if they haven't already.

Taking all this into consideration it appears to me as
  though the convenience gained by such an option tend to
out weigh the 'dangers' and that it should therefore be
implemented.

   In the very near future (hopefully this week-end)
some changes will be made in the handling of line drawn
(sized) characters. The goal is to make any write
statement (that uses only wired-in characters) appear
as much like size 0 (char memory plot) as possible when
drawn with lines in size 1.
   Towards this end, several characters will be available
"sized" that are not currently: ¬5 ¬/ ¬r ?? ?= and also
all the accent marks TOGETHER with the automatic backspace
associated with them...as with the ¬u used in u¬u, etc.
A few other chars will be drawn slightly differently to
correspond better to the wired in ones.
   WARNING: one possible problem is that ¬6 and ? can
currently be "sized" by sizing a write statement containing
the ?? and ?= instead. This improper assignment will be
changed and anyone relying on this fact will have to change
also.

   It has not been rejected; the standard statement is
to refer people to the work of Judy Sherwood (judy of pso)
who has done a number of experiments in this area and
can provide (I think) those who ask with efficient code
for doing this sort of thing. The question of just how
long to make the dashes and the spaces between them has
never been satisfactorily resolved to my knowledge.
   Note: it is quite possible that a "dotted line" mode
of operation can be incorporated into the new terminal
now being designed; I assume that the way one would build
this into the hardware would be to light every other dot
of a line.

My routines (perhaps awkward, but usable) were written
long ago and I have no doubt at all that there are faster
ways to do it.

I wrote those routines with the intention of providing a
pattern for a -drawb- command. Many of you know that a
TUTOR-coded pattern often is the forerunner of a system
feature. We wanted to get some idea of how a broken line
should look.

At first I was thinking of a broken line which would have
"pleasing" proportions... longer lines would have
longer dashes, shorter lines would have fewer segments.
However, Jack Stifle says that such a broken line is really
not feasible as a built-in broken line. He is thinking of
a dashed line like this: -----------------

---------- response 7
  03/08     16.48     steve       cu

     Well, I knew there was probably a faster way to do
it, but I hadn't seen anything on it, and thought I'd
share my efforts with others.
     I feel that a -drawb- command, if implemented,
should be able to vary the illuminated and nonilluminated
segment lengths. This would not only be something that
could please all, but one could draw multivariate graphs
in this manner.
     Is there the possibility of getting this implemented
in the forseeable future? The number of responses seems
to indicate that it would be a welcome addition.

one interesting way this is done in Hughes Conographics
systems is to have a bit mask representing when you want
a drawn element and when not... thus:
111000111000111000111000
would make a dot dashed line... etc.
11111001110011111001100
the mask is rotated around for each element of the line
and a decision to draw or not to draw that element is made
based on a convenient bit.

           you added notes to, so that several consecutive
           notes could be transferred without retyping
           lesson names.

Neither very important, but anything to encourage storing

---------- response 1

It would actually be kind of keen if (like the M option)
ALL of the special options left n1 alone, so that we would
not have to retype the stupid lesson name every time we
get a personal note, or try and check the user list.
Assuming, of course, that such an effort would involve
only the changing of a few defines or the like...

---------- response 2
  03/07     17.29     k mast       p

        The Append option is very difficult to implement,
mainly because the same buffer is used to Save the note
and to show you the next note. (That is why you must go
directly to the editor upon saving a note.) It has been
suggested that a person be allowed to directly write all
his notes to one of his lessons, which is certainly a
possibility someday....
        As for saving n1, sounds good to me.

   No. This is tied to the search command which is tied
to a super efficient algorithm for checking a whole
computer word for occurrences of a string. Much overhead
and inefficiency would be added if we tried to handle
strings longer than 10 characters (one computer word).
   I am curious what sort of things you are finding it
useful to replace that are longer than 10 characters,
Our initial assumption was that the most useful application
of this option would come in changing the names of defined
symbols (which are limited to 7 characters in length).

Seriously, the request is real! To answer your question:

instructors would be able to send quick messages to

nothing could be done.

How about this?
When you get the new course notes file working how about
making it possible for the course director to relay
pertinent notes from _students_ into the various notes
files in the regular "notes" lesson.
For instance, student argo needs info on a certain lesson.
He drops a note into the course notes file. The course
director finds that he cannot answer the note and by
pressing shift-LAB- relays the note into help notes in
lesson notes. When he gets a reply that answers the
question he presses some key combination, enters course
name and security code, and the pertinent reply is brought
back for all the students in the course to see.
Of course, this means the course director has to field
the notes every couple of days and he may need a heavy
hand on shift-HELP- to delete (operative for him only)
but I think it could work.

This is reasonably consistent with the way datasets
work. One can write a dataset with a dataset editor
outside the lesson, and not be recorded as last
author. If a person has the change code to the
dataset, it would be just as easy for him to edit
it remotely, therefore, it is likely that the
"last edited" information need be updated only when
a change is made to a dataset info page.

If it is intended that the last author be updated only
when the info page is changed, then the system handled
my case correctly. I assumed that last author referred
to any change made while in author mode. Does this mean
that a change to common made in author mode should not
update the last author?

I did have a special lesson unit to let me change the

However, the new system program is far better than what I

Well, the confusion occurs because it works differently
for a routed student/multiple than for a normal shluck.
For example, consider the code:

pause
jumpout key=next;helpless;x
keytype n1,next,shifted,x
show    n1

An author who presses NEXT will be sent to lesson
"helpless".

A router student who presses NEXT will see -1 displayed
on his screen.

Behavior like this was totally unexpected and quite sudden.
You might want to put this in aids, to prevent further

This one is complicated and long, so listen carefully:

1) The ieu in lesson hebrew46 consists of a -dataon-
command (look for yourself if you don't believe me).

2) I sent a student ("nessus" of "hebrew") to lesson
hebrew46 with a jumpout from the router, hrouter.
the jumpout was not to the beginning of the lesson, but
that doesn't matter. The ieu should be done anyway.

3) I STOP1'd "nessus" out. As an author, I went into the
datafile (hebrewdata) and looked. The -dataon- from my
router was there, but not the -dataon- from hebrew46.

-dataon- command:
*
at     505
write  Press -NEXT- to begin the lesson
pause
erase
*
and recondensed.

5) I signed off, and sent student "nessus" through to
hebrew46 again, and thereafter signed him off.
*
*
I have done steps 1-5 twice today. The first time,
after step 5, the -dataon- from lesson hebrew46 DID
show up in hebrewdata; the second time, it DID NOT.

1) The change code on hebrew matches the hebrewdata change
code; "nessus" has his data options on.
2) The value of -dataon- in a leter experiment was -1 and
error was = 0 after the dataon command. For an author,
error had a value of -1.

3) After "nessus" signed off, there were no other students
using datafile hebrewdata. Only authors were running in
course herbew all through this test. Further, during the
second try, nobody else was running in tre course while
I looked at the datafile under my mfl signon; file was not
"in use".

I do not believe this to be an isolated, experimental-
version fluke, This is because I have -dataon-s as the
ieu in all the hebrew lessons, yet NONE of them have
appeared in my datafile printouts from last week.

Currently only the first -dataon- the student encounters

Since you have a -dataon- in your router the only -dataon-

---------- response 1

   I believe it is indeed intentional and was recently
changed, with the rational being that when output has
been terminated by aborting it (via STOP key for example)
that the "normal" resting state of the terminal should
be with the touch panel DISABLED rather than ENABLED.
   If I have mis-described the exact situation I trust
some one else can re-state things more precisely.
   Is it the case that students randomly press the STOP
key and thus disable the touch panel? If you actually
have a unit branched to by the STOP key, putting an
enable command in it would fix the problem.
   Sorry if this is causing you difficulties.

It was at one time useful to be able to enable the panel
at any point. In debugging a lesson, if you forgot to
enable the panel at an arrow which only accepts touch
input, pressing -STOP- would allow you to go on and test
your lesson without recondensing for one little command.

Now there is only one key which will enable a touch panel
anywhere (the CLEAR switch). Unfortunately, this also
erases the screen.

Also, for us remote sites, we instruct the students to

happens, there is usually on way to re-enable the panel
without backing out of the lesson and entering again.
How about considering it along these lines?

        i hesitate to bring this subject up, but it seems
        that it is unavoidable. the general policy on games
        at the present time seems to be if you can afford
        the ecs, then that's up to you. unfortunately,
        another factor seems to entering the equation, that
        of cpu usage, which is not an allocatable resource
        at the present time.

        a course which i can inspect
        currently has 5 game players running. they have
        been on the system about three total hours, with
        a cpu total of 49.8 timps, a rather healthy chunk
        of system (backgound?) resources. we have several
        data collection rountines which also use this same

        my question is, our site currently has a restriction
        on game players during prime time, due to the
        obvious cpu "shortages" in effect then. should this
        prohibition period be extended further, with the
        increasing number of students running Sat. ¬+ Sun.,
        to help background users with legitimate
        needs? should there be a "suggested" site policy in
        this regard? (if other sites, in general, allow
        their users to use games, should we restrict our

   I would like to know the purpose of deleting the
games from a specific site. During prime time, I think that
would be an excellant way to solve the CPU hassle,
but during non prime time hours, why should games be
inhibited from a specific site. What other location
other than CERL is open at late hours of the day?
I am new on the system so I dont want to offend anyone.
It does seem to me that if games were inhibited at,
lets say the physics building after 10pm, then most avid
game players would go to CERL to play,thus depriving
students who wanted to work from doing so. A possible
solution to this problem would be to inhibit games at
a particular site in accordance with an increase of

Earlier today, there were over forty terminals in use

When this proved to be ineffective, the operator pla-

Of course, this prevents access by people at other
sites as well. It seems that there are two possible

1. A lesson inhibit list for each site

or, even better -

Which site options did you have in mind for the operator to

at an individual site is I think an obvious and important

Responding to the original note, however, I don't think you
have much hope of getting the students to throw off the
game-players and it shouldn't be their responsibility
either.?
I don't want to start the whole game controversy over again,

that game-playing cease in 165 ERL might be subject to some
sanctions. Comments?

        Most of the students go right to the operator for
assistance if they cannot find a terminal already... Perhaps
some guidelines should be set, ie:?
1) One gentle warning is given to all gameplayers that if
there are less than n terminals free in the room, they must
quit playing games immediately.?
2) The non-academic lessons being used for non-educational
purposes should be inhibited, at the operator's discretion.
(his word is deemed to be final)?
3) Those who persist should be backed out and their terminal
turned off for 1 minute.?
4) Further persistance would be cause for the operator to
inhibit the course of the violator from the site and the
name and course of the violator to be recorded, and reported
to the course director. What we don't need is a big brother
system where the unwary are punished, but a system of
checks and lots of warning... Dave Fuller

While I'd rather not discuss specific operator guidelines
without further thought - Mr. Mckeown, if it is not
the student's responsibility to throw off the gameplayers,
whose is it?
Are you in fact suggesting that someone intent on playing
games during non-prime time leave a terminal unused due
to the possibility of a student showing up sometime in
the future?
The only problem with the current policy is that students
either aren't aware that they have the right to throw off
gameplayers, or are afraid to do it and aren't aware that
they can ask the operator to do it for them.

inhibit the records being used. Then wait till he uses

A student in the main unit not at an arrow presses an active
helpop key. The helpop unit has an arrow in it. If he then
presses back, control returns to the main unit, but the

The -size-d characters were modified
1) so that size 1 characters match size 0 characters
2) some improved efficiency of drawing

Please leave word of any errors that occur to 'midden' 'p'.

1) SS now accepts rdraw commands. (hopefully!)
2) There is an option to convert draw commands to rdraws
    and also rdraws to draws if you so desire.
    (reached by pressing 'j' for joy, or would you believe
    lack of anything better?)
3) Many things have been speeded up, and other things
    taken out of backgnd due increased system load.
4) the problems noted with SS-ing draw commands should no
    longer exist.

Once again I suggest that you save a copy of the code you

Re: the new feature that causes the STOP key to disable
the touch panel (note -$365)...
     Last spring (May, I believe) this same change was
made (ie. the STOP key, which had been enabling, suddenly
began disabling). It caused big problems for touch users.
These problems were reported. The STOP key was changed
back to enabling.
     Here is a restatement of the problems caused by a
disabling STOP key: We find that our elem. school students
nearly always have hands and elbows resting around the
corners of the keyset. The STOP key is very likely to get
leaned on. When the panel goes dead, the student has no
idea what happened. (It looks like a system crash.)
Having to STOP1 and start the session all over again is
very frustrating to routed students.

We have not yet received a system verdict on the behaviour

pause
jumpout key=help;helpless;helpful

-helpless- and a routed student to lesson -helpful- So far
the only thing I have been able to find out is that the

  At the present, -size- commands do NOT work with charsets
(although I think work is being done in this area). If you
need some special chars enlarged, try John Eisenberg's
lesson 'lineset'. It should do the trick.

   Remember that the speed of plotting is reduced by
a factor of perhaps 25 by going to line-drawn characters
rather than using the ones stored in the terminals
(wired-in or designed yourself--both are equally fast).

I assume that there was sufficient need for it, or it
wouldn't have been implemented in the first place!

At any rate, it seems that the need(?) to protect lesson
names would be better served by an option to be set
by the author, which would prevent his lesson from being
viewed by others (in student mode).

If the author wants to protrect the name of his lesson he
can zero out (or set to some arbitrary value) the value
of n1. This would make the copy key inactive after using
that lesson. This would also allow going from read1 to
read300 with a lot less effort. Come on guys! Think a

This would protect the name of the lesson from those
people who did't have the change code (or perhaps the
inspect code), while giving those who do have the change
code the ability to easily go down the line of read1
to read300, hebrewo to hebrew72, etc...

Disabling the copy key in no way prevents someone from
accessing the name of the lesson he is in. Take for example
lesson sample with jumpouts to many other lessons. With the
copy key enabled you could stop1 out and press copy to get
the name of the lesson. Even with the disabling of it
all you have to do is to watch the person through course
records and see what lesson he is in. Now, are you going to
disable course records?

In response to d sleator of oldedit (response -$7), all

only people with special glasses can see any writing on the

the mess of all those chopped off typing fingers. The

there would be no change of some deviate wandering around

here is the easy solution:

make the lesson name appear as a random number of XXXs
no matter where it appears... block directory, author
mode page, etc.

might as well do the same for charsets and microtables and
leslists...

and printouts should have a large red stripe down the
middle and be kept under lock and key until the correct
author shows his id card. all authors are issued cards
which must be worn around the neck on a chain, so that we
know they belong in 257 cerl

        And to think that on plato3, the list of ALL
active packs and files were posted on the machine room
wall... It would seems to me that a few logical precautions
could be taken to assure security:?
Make the thing active if a bit is set IMMEDIATELY
after an author presses BACK from the BLOCK page and
nowhere else. This way it can be assured that the person
has indeed EDITED the lesson and the bit is to be UNSET
IMMEDIATELY after he goes anywhere but the author mode...

Proposal for a new system -term-:

-term pad- , which when invoked, gives an arrow at the
bottom of the page, at which one could type data visible on
the current page (anywhere in any lesson!) into some pre-
specified rotating file (i.e, one in which data overflowing
the block overwrites the data at the beginning).
        This feature would eliminate much illegible
scribbling on random scraps of paper, and also see-sawing
back and forth between an interesting page and one's own

Sounds good! But how would you have it remember where it
is writing the notes without typing in the location every
time?

How about storing it in the save buffer, so you could then
go into your lesson, create a block, and IS?

Then perhaps a notification that the buffer is full so
you won't overwrite.

i also like the idea. the save buffer would be a good

buffer for other things you are not usually making notes
about this-that-and-the-other-thing.

maybe a term to go along with it to view sequential lines
of your "pad"/save buffer would also be useful. then you
wouldnt have to IS into a lesson space.

Sorry about the lack of a response to your request for a
response to your previous request for a systems response.

The original request was for the ability to change the
authors record inspect code while in a lesson (to permit
use of the step option without having to leave the lesson,
change said code, and reenter the lesson). Since the
reentered lesson would have a binary already made, I would
guess that those responsible for step saw this as a very
low priority feature (if, indeed, it is desirable from the
standpoint of security). I will verify this. Again-sorry
you had to wait so long for a response.

---------- response 4
  03/13     12.08     layman       matha

no -- i think he means that one can back out to the author
page, use the S option to change your security code ¬+
reasonably expect the lesson to still be in ecs (ie not have
to recondense -- of course if you have step off then nothing
you do will get you into step code -- but w/out dat change
code you cant do step (the -term step- fails ¬+ just erases)
-- read the original note (in old notes somewhere)

---------- response 5
  03/13     14.17     avner       s

Right. Even if the lesson is not in ecs, a binary will
still be available and the condensing load will not be
as horrendous. Al

---------- response 6
  03/13     17.51     bradley       iu

It is really too bad you cannot create a new type of block
in binary which would be already compiled so all you had to
do was to replace it if you found some changes necessary.
  You could just convert a block to binary and store it
just like you convert a block to common or vocabs now.
 Some lessons that are used heavily could benefit from
this by never having to have students wait for condense.
 This could take the place of published lessons.

What we need is a means of setting the -end lesson- flag.
I would like to tell the student...

"Jolly Good, Friend!"

You may press -NEXT- for another lesson,
or -BACK- for review.

If teh presses -BACK- under the current scheme, he will not
get credit for having completed the lesson.

I would like to do something like this:

branch (alldone=yes),x,1hop
end    lesson
1hop

This would allow me to decide when the student has
"completed" the lesson, regardless of the order in which
he chooses to do the various parts of the lesson.

Yes, a scheme in which the "lesson completed, flag could

solve many of the problems people are having now in

lessons. This has been on the list-of-things-to-do for

Except for the case where a student presses stop1 to get
back to the router (i.e., when a press next to go to
index' is provided), you can accomplish quite a bit by
setting your own flag when the student completed the lesson.
Then do a test as you indicated to decide whether to
end   lesson or press stop1:?
jump  complet,x,s1
end   lesson
unit  s1
press stop1?
This is admittedly inferior to direct control of the lesson
completed flag, but should help.

The problem is that there are some open ended lessons
which do not end at a definite unit but "end" after a
sufficient time or score. The student should be able to
shift stop, have a flag checked to see if he has
met the criteria, and if so have the lesson completed
marker set. The students get hung up trying to get

When paging through the HELP NOTES index using the BACK

The notes program makes its decision about when to stop
showing notes based on a number of different things, such
as how many notes it has shown so far, how many notes it
has had to process to show that many notes, etc. The
result may or may not be something reasonable depending on
the number of responses to previous notes and other esoteric
variables.

This will probably be improved in the new version of notes.

       Aha! how about copy only working if:

a) You had inspected/changed the file previous to -copy-,

b) the lesson had an -inhibit- nocopy in it (new feature?)

---------- response 3
  03/12     20.55     bowery       comm

 I don't think that the inspect/change codes are kept in ECS
and therefore this feature would require a disk read (ugly).

  The inhibit nocopy would not protect an author from
having his lesson name spread abroad of he did not happen
to see that portion of aids. I think I read one of the
systems staff say in a previous note that the system
assumes the responsibility of protecting an author's
lesson name for copyright reasons. This feature would
not accomplish that end.

Well, here's a possible solution. I'm not sure that
those affected would want it, but...
How about being able to calc a variable to the name
of the lesson, and activating the copy key for that
ture, those groups with large lessons can implement
the "calc" in each of their lessons, and have the
copy key active, People not wanting this feature
simply don't do the calculation.

  03/12     21.31     fuller       uimc

      Inhibit nocopu sure would protect an author...
if he left the command out, when the author exited from
the lesson te copy key would be inactive. If he put it
in, then the copy key would be active...

I sympathize -- we have 110 lessons differing by only
the numbers -- but I would sure as hell rather the
system programmers spent their time making NEEDED changes
to the system (-release/reserve-; group notes; student
data; half-part files; group file allocation; etc) than
to have them waste time on such wierd solutions as have
been proposed, like a new -inhibit- flag. I want changes
in PLATO too, but I guess my priorities differ a little......

A simple way to help authors of sex1 through sex999
and similar series would be to have the copy key operate
to copy up to the first non-alphabetic character or
up to the first number. The part copied would appear
as XXXXX as suggested in an earlier note.

YES...we are altering the time-slicing structure/priorities
drastically...

this is necessary to maintain the "instantaneous"
key-echoing that is a hallmark of the PLATO system...

it has been necessatated by the ever-increasing load of
terminals running at any given time (approaching 500!)...

please bear with us for a few days! we will explain the
changes when done...

already, we have reduced the average key-echoing delay
when running 460 terminals from 300+ milliseconds to
about 180...

Good show! By the way do you plan to limit the number of

climbing?

---------- response 2
  03/13     15.44     k mast       p

        I believe it is currently limited to 660 maximum.
The number of terminals hooked up to the system will be
1000 until we get more processing power. Our experience
so far is that slightly more than half of the terminals
hooked up to the system will be in use at one time.

---------- response 3
  03/13     19.35     golden       s

The current limit is 600 terminals. Present plans call
for a total of about 950 terminals attached to this system,
so it is doubtful that we will see 600 of them on at once.

Strange occurrence:

A Hebrew student reported to me that he got an execution
error upon jumpout to Hebrew talkomatic (lesson htalko)
in the morning, he tried again later and got to the
lesson OK. Neither the router (hrouter) nor the lesson
has a jumpout code. The jumpout that took him there
was a straight:
*

jumpout htalko
*
The lesson was not edited at all this morning; I was
out shopping.

The student was somewhat vague about the above sequence;
what I've reported is what I culled from his report.
It's either a case of non-observant student or funny
error of some kind. Anybody else having these problems?

Between the hours of about 1300(1:00 pm) and 1500(3:00 pm)
it cannot be guaranteed that a given print will be printed
within a half hour of the time that it is submitted. i.e.
marked "printing" in lesson "requests". What this
means is that if you ask for a print at 1:00 it may take
as long as until 3:00 to get printed and marked "done".
This is due to the heavy load on the "condensor".
For most people this will make little difference, however,
I am concerned for those who are printing "datafiles" and
wish to re-initialize them after they are printed. This
situation will not be cured in the near future. therfore,
I suggest you make sure you have no pressing need during
these high activity hours because there will be nothing I
can do.

  Yes, but some site directors use impersonal signons
purely to simplify bookkeeping. Our signons are assigned
totally by the dept. we author/study in and our status
(student, faculty author, student author). It is not
because of a large number of authors, since our site
director knows most of us personally. Therefore, MOST
authors should not be condemned for their impersonal
signons since they (unhappily) have no voice in its
selection.

  I dont think one should be forced to use a long name
when he can reasonably use something short. And I can see
no real reason for not letting him choose his own name
(within reason). If you wnat to trace him for some reason
you can always match the name with the person(assuming

Recently I reported a similar minor bug in the charset
editor. If you press -NEXT1- after typing the lesson name
on the author mode page, you go to the last block edited
Then back out to the block directory page, enter and edit
any charset, then press -BACK-. You are not returned to
the block directory page, as expected, but rather to the
legendary "last block edited".

Just tried it out -- it works the same for a common or
a vocab block, but not for a micro or leslist. Hope this
helps. And even if it doesn't, the thing is not difficult
to live with.

     The CAI author is always faced with the problem of how
to correct a student's errors effectively. A corrective
feedback procedure will be proposed as a possible solution
to this problem. The paradigm has four features: type of
corrective feedback (contingent on the type of error); in-
creasing ratio review; discrimination training, and cri-
terion (mastery) teaching.
     A research study was conducted (102 students) which
tested the various components of the paradigm within the
context of a CAI drill. This research will also be dis-
cussed.

You are invited to view an on-line

        Once again, the game players in 165 cerl totaly
occupied all of the terminals, leaving none open for those
interested in serious work. It was particularly severe
tonight (3/14) because of the active multiple game jumpout
demo/eoh. I agree with Mike Berger that an effort to
educate students as to terminal priorities is the best way
to handle this problem, but untill this is done on a large
scale, I think the operator should periodically check on
the number of people waiting (about 10 at 10:15 or so)
and check what lessons are running, with obvious action
on gameplayers. Also inhibiting games (or in this case, the
eoh multiple) is an attractive alternative. I play games
too, but not when people are waiting for terminals.
        Any other plausible suggestions (or any reasons why
mine aren't?)

   I would like to say that on the whole the operators
try to keep gameplaying to a minimum in room 165 except
when there are free terminals. If you need a terminal
for 'serious' work, then you might walk across the hall
and tell us. If I am on duty I will make sure that noone
is playing games -- even though I cannot assure you of a
terminal.

   Since games, after all, do have a place on the system,
it is often difficult to allocate resources, especially from
my viewpoint as an operator.
   If you have a problem, come talk to us. We may be able
to help.

        First of all the operator asked those waiting
several times if they needed a terminal for class work.
Most of them just wanted to see PLATO, using the demo-eoh
signon. Secondly, the demo-eoh signon is not a 'games'
signon but a signon that allows first time users of PLATO
to use a variety of lessons. At the time you mentioned
demo-eoh did not have access to any pure 'games', they
had been inhibited to prevent abuses.

        I realize that multiple signons are abused, but
some of them do have valid uses. Demo-eoh allows
first time users to see some of the capabilities of the
PLATO system.

Thank you,

     I would like to propose that any demonstration
multiple should have in its router a check for ptime
and memory use. the second part being set at 80: of
the the amount of ECS that the site normally uses.
This can allow for the multiple to run and leave some
terminals free for use by others.
     The above restriction can be released when the
room is reserved for the course.

Most people have such a check somewhere in their router:
iudemo certainly does. The problem is that in these days
of the ECS glut and the CPU crunch, the use of ECS at a
site no longer reflects accurately the use of terminals
at the site.
Perhaps we need some kind of measurement of CPU use like
"muse" and "mallot" for ECS use?

---------- response 6
  03/15     06.19     eric       weather

also, a station check would be most useful in limiting
multiple signon usage to just the site that created them.
(this probably wouldnt be very useful at UI if you wanted
to allow the multiple to be used at any plato classroom on
campus, but for most remote sites would be feasible).

just a thought.... _/_¬=¬¬=ˆˆ_

---------- response 7
  03/15     09.33     md       csa

        Good idea and we tried that with demo-eoh but
several site directors asked us to open up their sites
so that visitors could use the eoh multiple. We still
have several sites restricted so that demo-eoh doesn't
take over PLATO.

        One interesting phenomenon is that when we
restricted demo-eoh the students didn't leave, but just
used a different signon. Perhaps what is needed is a
universal demo/games signon that will prevent abuses,
but still allow casual users to get the most out of
PLATO when there is room to allow for it.

Thank you for your suggestion, sutter. Your four weeks
on the system certainly have taught you the use of notes.
Unfortunately, you imply that all important demonstrations
of plato must be done after 10:00 am, and when prime time
is extended, demos will have to be given later.
Further, why is 80: of all available ECS for the site
necessary for any demo?

Actually, I think that no student should be required to
show the minimal amount of intelligence and initiative
required to tell a gameplayer to leave. Furthermore,
we should leave most students with the impression that
they can't throw gameplayers off of terminals, so we will
have more of these notes where we rehash the same arguments
used approximately four times a semester. Finally, I would
like to thank all the people who asked us to put checks on
-demo eoh- that were already in effect, and expecially those
who wanted us to inhibit sites whose directors had requested
that we leave open. Also, I think sutter's suggestion is
too mild. All interactive demonstrations should be aban-
doned, since a person can get the feel of PLATO more effec-
tively from a lecture.

     Instead of complaining, all you have to do is travel
a short 4 feet across the hallway and ask the operator to
secure a terminal for you over a gameplayer if you have
serious work to do. There have been so many debates on
this subject in notes, and they all end up the same way...
Is it that hard to walk 5 feet? The operators are very

     I agree that 4 feet is not far to walk. But my
main concern was for those who appeared to be students
(apparently many of them were not) and did not seem to
know that they could get a terminal by asking the operator
to secure one for them. I personally cleared out and went
to the Physics Building from where I wrote the original
note. 4 feet is not too far to walk, if you only know
that it will get you a terminal. I repeat, it's really
up to the students, but untill they are all told..........

     I didn't announce it at the time, but Personal
Notes was recently changed to allow you to send a note
by pressing SHIFT-NEXT while in insert mode. I find it
very convenient in that I dont have to press BACK, wait
for the page to plot, then press SHIFT-NEXT to send.
        Some people have noticed it, however, in that they
went to press the ':', or SHIFT-EDIT, or SHIFT-ERASE and
accidently sent a note by mistake.
        I personally like the option, as do a few of my
friends, who originally suggested the idea. I'm willing to
change if many people object on the basis of sending too
many notes by mistake.

Frankly, Kim, I have sent more than one note prematurely
because of sloppy typing, hitting SHIFT/NEXT instead of
SHIFT/ERASE. If you want a vote, I'd prefer the old way.
Considering that key actuation will be standardized
between new PLATO NOTES and PERSONAL NOTES, isn't it
a little risky to have SHIFT/NEXT terminate a note? You
might end up with a lot of partial notes in GENERAL.

from u of michigan (rm 115/dcl/4 pm).

is there any possibility that this conflict might be
resolved by the rescheduling of one or the other of the
talks?

     We didn't see this coming and naturally regret the 
conflict since there may be some interest overlap. However'
neither seminar can be conveniently rescheduled, so I
guess you'll just have to choose.

     You can find a copy of the Siegel-Misselt Seminar

  I just spent alot of debugging time on a rather dumb
error that could have been easily seen with the proper
condense errors.
  Why is it that when a unit requires parameters and you
don't pass the correct ammount or none at all, there is
no mention of it when you condense the lesson?
  Please tell if and when this will be fixed. I hate to
think of all the troubles people who have the programming
habit of passing parameters have gone through because
of this problem.

  Thanks,

Yeah. Like, if you want to call

unit    tick(tock)

and -tock- already has the proper value in it, or if
you want to institute defaults.

unit    coke(machine,doesnt,work)
calcs   args<3,work?1,,            $$ will give -work- a
c                                            default value of 1
c                                      if not specified in
c                                      the call

Sorry you had trouble finding your problem, but, as the
previous replies indicate, the freedom to rely on current
values of parameters as a default case is an intentional
feature. This approach was selected after considerable
thought and is preferred by most users of the language to
the more rigid approach.

       By the way Glen, I have implemented some changes
in the next version of pnotes to allow you to skip notes,
the same as with responses in plato notes now.
       You will, however receive appropriate time-consuming
message before and after you read your notes if any of
the limits are almost exceeded.
       It should make things a little better for people
who actually do have reason to keep a lot of notes around,
but at the same time warn those who are in danger of
imparing their note-receiving ability.

when i see i have a new note , i want to read it first,
but instead i must spend all my time ( and the systems's

a rearrangement to allow me to start at the end and work

This bug is one of long standing, and so far as I can
tell nothing has been done about it yet:
When you condense a router lesson, and students are using
the lesson. a routed student who happens to be in the
router is counted twice on the page which begins
"Since there are students running in this router,
you may not condense it.
There are X=A=W=M=IX=A=W=M=I students and ** authors in this lesson."
That number X=W=M=A=IX=W=M=A=I is always greater than the number of
students listed on the data page by exactly the number
of routed students that are in the router.

---------- note 170 recordkeep
  03/17     22.28     galcher       uimatha

        Would like to make some comments/suggestions about
the way course records are kept and security in general on
the system. Due to some of the people known to have access
to course records or who tend to "vulturize" terminals
as to pick up said codes, if the change code to a course
is obtained one of many things can happen:
        1. This person( whether he actually be course
           director or no ) has now access to all the
           records in the course. I would wonder about
           the practicality of this. Consider the
           following hypothetical sequence of events:

        A certain member of the course csa(for example)
        who knows the change code to this course but does
        not have the code in his lesson security codeword
        already goes in and edits(or just looks at) the
        course file and the inspect code for the course
(continued)

---------- response 1
  03/17      22.39     galcher       uimatha

        and he must type in the change code in front of the
        eagerly awaiting "vulture". He does so unaware that
        even the person is watching him type in the code.
        Typing in the code he goes merrily on his way and
        examines the course records. He remembers that he
        must check someone elses notefile so he signs out
        momentarily and checks the other persons pnote
        file. He then signs in again with his signon and
        the "vulture" again picks up another signon, Now it
        would not actually be necessary for the "vulture"
        to actually see the course security code but just to
        know that the code is in there would be enough
        allowing for the fact that this "vulture" borrows
        the authors password...

---------- response 2
  03/17     22.52     galcher       uimatha

          He then waits for the csa person to leave and
        signs in under that same signon and goes directly
        to the course records. He examines another persons
records and zeros the password to the persons signon
and puts in his own.This other person (the "vulture"
happens to know) just happens to have the lesson
security code to a large group of lessons all having
the same change code and therefore he has just
gained access to all these lessons.
   The proceeds to sign on with this other and go
into one of this large group of lessons and change
the change,inspect,common,etc., codes on it and
having this change code already in the lesson
security codeword, could go into any of the other
lessons and do the same thing.

   Now I realize this is a rather extremist look at things
but it could happen and granted there have been times when
you wish you could go find a terminal in a nice deserted
room where no one would see you sign on.
        So, as a suggestion to possibly protect against
this sort of happening, would it be perhaps a better idea
if authors had to type in their lesson security code each
time they sign in(or in other words every time they stop1
out, the lesson security code be zeroed) as to prevent this
sort of happening, I realize that it is a convenience to
not have to type this blasted thing in everytime you sign
on but if people are careless with their records then chaos
may sometime ensue. Many of the authors Know usually zero
or garbage up their security code before they leave at night
and I think the security code wouldnot be taken for granted
as much as it is now.

---------- response 4
  03/17     23.29     galcher       uimatha

        Or maybe a slight change could be brought about in
the lesson which handles course records. When the password
of an author is changed, have the lesson security code
zeroed at the same time. This could and would prevent the
happenings of before and would only give the "vulture"
access to the signons in the course. As for the free access
to all the signons in the course. Should the course director
have the option of at any time changing the password on
any author records? This basically allows the course
director to examine any person in that course's personal
notes and he could say he accidently hit the wrong key
while looking at the persons records.Is this a good idea?
Should there possibly be some greater security against
indiscriminate acts such as these? Oh well, back to work.
Hoping your news is good news,

      Although I am willing to respect your experience in
the field. I do not think that responsibility (or burden)
for security of change codes to courses or lessons should
be placed upon the system users.

   It is true that prying eyes are everywhere, and there
are even people who are low enough to try to steal others
signons. However,I believe that responsibility for this

        I am sure that you have carefully thought out
all the findings that you state in your note, Mr. Galcher,
but it would seem to me that the type of person who has
nothing better to do than develope his eyes deserves nothing
better than a drano enema... Most particularily one who
has nothing better to do but to rip off signons and
codewords...
        I suggest no further measures be taken other than
to be watching for people who are places that they should
not be... and report actions by people who are doing things
they should not be. 3 times having your lesson wiped out
will make you rather bitter about such things, as they have
with me...
        And to submit that anybody who does these things and
gets caught better run... It's a losers game...

   I do admit that such a thing is not only possible, but
has happened in the past. I maintain, however, that I should
not have to be burdened to any greater extent by having my
change code zeroed every time I leave the system.
   Most of my lessons have no inspect code on them. This
means that I must go into them, press -DATA1-, and enter
it, Usually, since I am a rotten typer, I find that it is
wrong and must repeat the procedure. I dislike
doing this intensely, and do not feel that the savings
in security for some person who accidently reveals his
code to another party is justification for my hardship.

   The issue basically boils down to that of
how much the system is responsible for in the way of
user irresponsibility with their own security. I feel that
we have enough already.

I find it hard to believe that all this valuable disk
space has been consumed by such a request.

1. I don't think that too many people subtly look over
your shoulder while you type security code. I
suggest that you look carefully over your shoulder every
time you type in a code.

2. Making a person type the same code every time he
sings on makes it that much easier to find out what
that code is.

3. If you really are concerned that someone will use your
records to edit your lesson, keep a careful log of when
_you_ have last used your records and edited your lesson,
and check upon signon.

4. _you_ garbage your password before signing off. What's
so hard? I've been doing it for a year.

People do try and do steal codes. In our case a number
course records were mysteriously edited and inspection
revealed 3 new authors and an instructor in every course.

  The only preventives are to scramble your security code
and not let anyone watch over your shoulder..  If someone
insists on looking over your shoulder a subtle punch in the
mouth should work (if that puts your job on the line get
your brother to do it).

    I do agree tho that it might be a wise idea to
garbage up the security code that a person has entered
whenever his password is changed (whether from course
records or during the sign-on procedure). This would
inconvenience no one and if it is implemented should
be very easy.

  Now all you gotta do is convince the people that can do
something about it of the same thing.

The amount of inconvenience Galcher's two suggestions would

Call me paranoid if you want, but I got called on the carpet

of my initials.

I tend to agree with galcher/meers/michael in that, while
the idea of "vulturizing" passwords is a low and dirty
thing, we have to realize that not every person on this
system is as good and upright as ourselves (!). I per-
sonally do not find it inconvenient to re-type a security
code (and if you work here at night, you do it a lot any-
way); and it is NOT always possible to garbage up your
password before you leave -- for example, a quickie backout,
followed by 2 or 3 hours of downtime, when you really don't
want to wait around just to fix your code!

Give some serious thought to this, people! I think it
deserves consideration. Or don't you WANT tighter security?

The main complaint about security seems to relate to access
to course records.

Course records has (have)its (their?) own special editor.

I find it a pain to enter course records, find that I'm in
inspect only, press a bunch of wrong keys, get to the
author mode page, get AIDS, "return common", whatever you
get from the DATA and DATA1 key, etc., before I type in an
erroneous code and repeat the process twice.

Why not kill two birds with one stone:
Zero the change code upon entry to the course records editor
and provide a place IN THE=E  EDITOR to enter a new code.

I really think that no matter what is done, the vultures
will find a way around it. So until the day comes when
you can lay your hand on the screen and get a finger printed
security code, its probably just more work for CERL that
wont effect a full solution, Perhaps, the simpler interim
solution is to allow 60 character codewords. Remember
the limits of short term memory appear to be 7^+=-2. And if
you type with any speed at all, (famous last words) there
is no way for a vulture......

simple enough to do and should offend no one. I will

that many more code-type-ins which can be observed -- its

I was just gonna mention that when you (or anyone who may
just happen to known your signon password)
backs yourself off a terminal (by pressin help1 after you
get the password right) your security code is scrambled
but after some testing I couldn't say for sure.

   It seems to have the password intact that was entered
last time you signed off normally and your records were
returned to disk..

There is one problem about scrambling your password before
you logoff. What if the system crashes and won't be back up
for longer than a half hour? I find it very inconvient to
have to wait the half hour just so that I can sign on and
scamble my password. Plus there are those people who
sometimes forget accidentally to scramble it if they have
something on their mind.

  I am for having the password zeroed when you just sign
on because I would like to see the increase in security
that it would provide.

   Great idea, Stan but you can't type the password very
well when you hold the keyboard in a contorted position.
And wait until you drop that keyboard on the floor. It

To bradley:

How can you say that you have _only_ had someone else use
your records once?? Once is enough to do a lot of damage
to anything you may own including your reputation. Records
should never be vultured in the first place and the
whole purpose of the note is to try and correct this
problem.

   I think that a lot of people are taking this problem
too lightly. If the authors of PLATO ever got together
and counted the times records have been vulturized, they
would be astounded. Please think about the problems
that someone could if they had _your_ records!

    Question: What are the "vulture's" objectives?

alternative answers
        1) Create various user-type records
        2) "SPY out hte land"
        3) Malicious or Destructive purposes
        4) and so on

Each of these different purposes may be examined with the
idea that their cause and thus their "solutions" differ.

Eg: In the case of 1), does the site have excessively
restrictive access, but is nevertheless "unmanned" a
significant fraction of the time? If so, the solution to
the vultures may lie here...ie, course records as a means
to the end of site-access implies "lock up" the site.
   The difference between law enforcement and crime
prevention should shape the tactics we as a community
adopt in reducing the incidence of unwanted behaviors.

I agree with the proposition that security codes be zeroed
when people sign-off. The inconvienience of retyping each
time is minor compared with that of repairing any damage
a "vulture" might do.
I object withn the idea of scrambling security codes
when a password is changed. I change my password every
once in a while to help cut down on "vulturism" and I
wouldn't want my security code changed every time
I did.

i have a question about SD mode of the editor -

if your tutor source goes over one line of text, "R" to
remove the last item says that "You can only remove the
last item.", even tho you just put it in.

for example if you generate something like this:

draw   1212;1313;2313;.......;1010
910

and press "R" immediately after the "p" at 910,
you get "You can only remove......"

it took me a couple of tries to check this since you don't
know when you cross a line untill you press BACK, but
you can find a test in block "sd test" of lesson "pli".
copy this out to a block of your own, and then SD it.
duplicate it a few lines down, and then remove the last
point...

   Alternative to showing the amount of space
left in the bloc: if the amount of code that we
want to insert is greater than the remaining space
in the bloc and if (say) we have room in the lesson
for another bloc, then have the ID or SD use something
like the 'E' option of the editor to create a new bloc
with same name as old bloc ¬+ move " tail end" of bloc
into that area. (By "tail end" of bloc,I mean those lines
at the end of the bloc such that if they were removed, the 
material created in ID/SD could be inserted at the point
originally indicated by the author.)

*
until I got rid of the defined name stustaf the dataset
command kept coming up with error set to o (doesn't exist)
I realize stustaff is close to stustaf but how does PLATO
wind up making them equivalent. Is this a dataset
pecularity or a general file naming thing?

It thought you were asking for the dataset name stored
in variable "stustaf", which was probably garbage. During
condense time, extra characters beyond the 7th are ignored
in variable names except in a define statement, where they
are illegal. Thus:

define  set
        garbage=n1
*
zero    garbage
jump    garbage1,a,x
jump    garbage2,a,x
jump    garbage3,a,x
at      1010
write   garbage=garbage1=garbage2=garbage3

The write statement will always be executed and the
"undefined" variables recognized.

I would agree with the idea of alternate delimiters (i.e.,

lot of logical operations, it is considerably easier to
read than a line clottered with $or$ and the like.

Re: the note titled "recordkeep" which seemed to be so
popular.

        As another suggestion to the problem of internal
security (ie. lesson security codes) would it perhaps be
better to zero the security code as the person signs in?
Then in case of a system crash (since it is anticipated
that the code zeroing would be accomplished during a system
backout) you would not have to worry about sitting around
waiting for the system to come back up to zero the code.

        So far, from the replies to the other note, there
is some feeling of dissatisfaction over the current security
system. I did notice however that for the most part, the
people who disagreed to the idea of code zeroing came up
with the argument of they were too lazy to type it in every
time they signed on! LAZY is one thing, but.....

After a good deal of discussion, there seems to be some
consensus among the staff that zeroing the lesson security
code would DECREASE security, as pointed out by some
notes-writers. If the security code is zeroed, you would
have to retype it each time you sign in, thus increasing
the probability that someone might read your fingers. There
is certainly no way to prevent someone from reading your
fingers as you type your sign-on password (tho you might
turn the keyset upside-down in your lap), but we can at
least minimize the opportunity to learn lesson security
codes.

1) The original note asked about changing the security code
only if the sign-on password was changed from either
course records or from the sign-on pages..

2) If you intentionally scramble your code everytime you
sign-off then a system crash need not worry you as the
code will be the same as last time you signed-off (and that
means the code would be garbage).

About changing the security code if the password is changed:

I think this is a good idea, since normally a password
is changed either for
        a)security reasons
        b)by a 'vulture', for reasons unknown
In the first case, it would definitely be a good idea to
zero the security code at the same time. In the second
case, it is desirable to have it zeroed for obvious reasons.

If someone is going to go through the proceedure of changing
their password, then I can't see how they can complain about
having their security code zeroed at the same time.

I would prefer to have the security code zeroed at every
sign-off, but I can see the validity of the objections to
this, so I think the zeroing only when the password is
changed is a very practical compromise.

And as a compromise to all involved, maybe another possible
solution would be to zero the security code if and only if
the password is changed from the course records. Thus if the
records are "vulturized" from course records (ie example
in note recordkeep) then the "vulture" would have just
another signon. Note of course that some people set up their
lessons such that only they can change certain sections
of it during execution (ie. allowing people to edit the
common of the lesson) and this would be practically
impossible to protect against....

I have heard ideas kicked around which would involve
grouping lesson names by area, as well as by system.?
I think the idea of three words is to allow for the
most elaborate scheme which is likely to be seriously
considered for adoption. If everyone codes their lessons
to allow for the possibility of 3-word names, those
lessons will not have to be changed when the naming
schemes are changed.

I think that you are thinking about an instructor when
you say that an author cannot be backed out. A course
director is able to back out anyone in his course except
himself. As far as deleting records of running students,
I don't think this would be feasable in that you will have
an identity on the system which has no records. When the
user is backed out, the system updates his record. There
would be no record to update if a course director were
allowed to delete running records.

If you want to be able to change passwords of running
user so that he cannot sign back in after you back him out,
a better solution would be to allow a course director to
back out an individual from his records page. This way,
the course director could change the password right away
before the user could sign back in.

  The plotting on the 'presently running' page does not

individual records page in time to catch the culprit
before he signs back on. I also am in favor of a 60 sec.
re-signon delay or the ability to change the password

is to change/disattach the router and then back them out,
thus sending them to limbo or elsewhere; authors, well...

  A year ago I wrote Mr. Propst inquiring about the PLATO
system. The documents I received (along with a letter
of explaination) lead me to believe that this system's
definition of what is educational was very progressive
and broad-minded. Generally I got the picture that
a 'course-writer' type of instructional format was about
the furtherest thing from the collective mind of PLATO
and that interaction and positively motivated involvment
with quality lesson material was the main goal.

  I assume that this wholistic out-look as to what is
educational will be maintained and that a prime variable
to be weighted in these cases of 'arbitrary deletion' will
be whether it is DESTRUCTIVE. I hope I do not hear of
constructive 'non-educational' lessons being usurped.

Consider: I received a form letter from you some time

your proper name. Now, if you had not made a point of
including your signon in the letter, I would have had
no way to contact you on line. I certainly had no
intuitive connection between the signature on the letter
and the signon I had seen in Plato notes. Use of your
first name may be perfectly familiar to those in your

i am really sorry to see the system staff taking
so much abuse and sarcasm for one of the soundest

clear cases of users who try deliberately to interfere
with the enjoyment of the system by others and it
is a waste of resources and talent to demand that the
system impose software limits which will make this
abuse impossible in all cases. what would help would
be delineation of what the system considers improper
use.

with respect to abuse, it has been observed that some use
resources (disc, cpu, condensor, terminals) for
purely recreational purposes in prime time when
other users who have to work are being deprived. if
the system allocated all resources in some equitable

that if recreational users were not on in prime time,
then the remaining resources would serve the rest better.
i do not argue with the merits of encouraging people
to be creative and to experience the system. i doubt
that that function is served by interterminal combative
games in prime time.
i believe that the systems staff has correctly inhibited
certain users in outright protection of the rights of
the majority of users. i think they should go one
more step and encourage everyone to use the utmost
restraint in the recreational use of the system during
the periods when users are most numerous. I'll be glad

a) The systems feature note says nothing about recreational
   use; it says non-educational use. "recreational" is
   hard enough to define, though Dr. Hody is welcome to try;
   even he may find it harder to distinguish between "non-
   educational" and "educational".
b) Dr. Hody, your point about "what is abusive" seems to me
   to be precisely the point of the majority of responses
   to the above note, viciously as some may be worded.
c) The other important point that you seem to have missed is
   that "abusive" lesson spaces and courses are to be
   deleted without notification or warning. The example of
   the new author doing something he should not unwittingly,
   and therefore being forever banned from the system seems
   a little outlandish, but it is far from being impossible.

There is an article on interactive communication in the
March l975 issue of Scientific American. The entire
article is interesting, and relevant to PLATO work in a 
number of ways. Immediately relevant was the finding that
communications in the problem-solving situations that the
authors studied were _extremely_ disorderly--much worse than
anything we see in notes--BUT the problem solving went
forward quite efficiently anyhow. Anyone who's ever
written for publication knows that polishing can take three
times as long as original composition--useless waste in
informal communications. Put-downs of others for the ways
they use language are, perhaps unconsciously, forms of
social discrimination. (The between-the-lines message: "I'm
better than you are...".) Surely we can do without that

I am considering a limited form of restriction of the
physics site to permit students from any course to work
there, but to permit authors to work only if they are
working on physics curriculum materials. It has proven
very difficult for CERL itself to set policy on the
issuance of author records and file space, and it may be
necessary for individual site directors to do so. We find
that non-physics "authors" at our site are almost never
writing materials to be used in University courses. We feel 
no obligation to provide computer services in our building

Bruce Sherwood generally presents a carefully considered
point of view. However, I believe a slip has occurred
here. For many years the value of "computer literacy" has
been continually restated, most recently by the Dartmouth
people in _Science_. A major form of computer-based
education promoting computer literacy is having students
actually write programs, which for all practical purposes, 
must be done in TUTOR using the facilities of author mode.
Language simulators that run in student mode do exist on
the system, but due to their heavy ecs,disk access and
program size requirements, continued satisfactory operation
is questionable.
    Perhaps I am assuming too much. Does PLATO policy
only recognize the mode of CAI in which students interact
with programs written by teachers as the only legitimate
use,or at least the only use that can be supported by the
system?

It is my experience in chemistry that people with "author"
records that come to use the terminals are just playing
around. I have never found one, and I have talked to
many, who was in fact working on any lesson associated
with a course. It is true that such "authors" are
sometimes not in identified game lessons, but just
using the editor with no defined purpose is also a game
that takes a lot of cpu.

   The continued restriction of more and more terminals
is a subject of serious concern. Their are compelling
arguments, again most lucidly put forth by the Dartmouth
people, that maintain that computer resourses should be
made as available as library resoruces. For most campuses
such goals can only remain a dream. Surely with over
600 terminals we can make substantial progress along these
lines. Instead of making progress, it seems that as more
and more terminals are installed in Urbana, less become
generally available. CERL is hard to fault here, their
terminals are nearly all available to the general user at
one time of another. However, very little is done too
encourage others to follow a similar policy. One easy
way to provide this encouragement would be to increase
the connection charge by a factor of 10 to any set of
non-research terminals that were not available to the

---------- response 8
  03/20     12.55     carter       comm

the general plato user (both student and author) for a
reasonable period (say 3 or 4 hours per day). If course
restricting a terminal cost an extra $15,000 , I think
Bill would be bothered with less requests.
   I hope the University Library doesn't change its system.
It would be a horrible annoyance if in order to use the
History Library, you must be enrolled in a history course.
    The point of these notes is to emphasize there is
substantial educational benefit to be derived from making
library and computer resourses as available as possible.
Books will get ripped off, just as PLATO may occassionally
be abused. Highly restricted access is not a viable
solution.

Maybe I'm missing something here, George, but it seems to
me that the PLATO system is _n__o__t_ an open system in the terms
of your library analogy -- the terminals used for physics
and chemistry, along with the multitude of users situated
around the country, were purchased _for_ _specific__ purpose_!
It seems (from this viewpoint, at least) that the directors
of these respective sites have every right to restrict in
order that the original purpose of having PLATO (i.e. to
TEACH chem/phys) be more effectively utilized.

On the other hand, the University Library exists in order
to provide an open service to all U of I students -- quite
a different function, in my eyes.

I have to admit, though, that I'll hate to see the physics
site restricted. It's right across from where I live.

Drs. Sherwood and Smith:

        I sympathize with your decision to course-
restrict your terminals, since you must take into
account the priorities of students in your respective
areas. However, I would like to point out that, like
Mr. Frye, I also live across from the Physics Building
and find it very convenient to use the terminals there,
especially in the eveing. Furthermore, my uses are
almost entirely related to my professional authoring, 
strange as it may seem.
        Perhaps a different attitude can be developed
among users, one in which an author engaged in "non-
educational" use would yield his terminal according to
your posted priority lists. Until that time, I'm afraid
I have to agree with you.

Thanks to Frye! Yes, it is indeed true that the chem and
phys terminals were acquired to do a specific thing: teach 
chemistry and physics. This certainly does color our view
on their use. I stated our proposed policy starkly to get
people's attention. In actual fact we can make arrangements
for a small number of serious authors to work at our site.
But first we will close the gate, then open it a little, in
a very controlled way.

I do agree with the Dartmouth philosophy. University
of Illinois personnel should have access to time-shared
computing services. We are not yet in a position to provide
it equitably thru PLATO. We have a MUCH larger student to
terminal ratio than Dartmouth has (I think we have less
than 300 terminals on our campus of 35000, where they have
100 or 200 on a campus of something like 5000--correct me
if I'm wrong). Moreover, most of our terminals are tied up
giving direct instruction, something Dartmouth does not
attempt, and in the writing of such instroctional materials.
The comparatively few remaining terminal-hours can satisfy
the general computing needs and interests of only a tiny
privileged group, and in no way can give general, equitable
access to the University community.

---------- response 13
  03/20     20.27     b sherwood       phys

I might add that many students in my Physics 106 class have
asked me for author records. While I would very much like
to give them this access, knowing how educational it can be
to work with a computer, I have turned down these requests.
It would be grossly irresponsible of me to give out such
records, knowing that there are not resources to support
such large-scale activity.

Another aspect of this is the fact that we CAN offer
direct instruction to a reasonably large number of physics
students, which is equitable, while granting author records
to a small, arbitrarily-chosen group of students is not
equitable.

   I have just examined the "terminal" program and remain
unconvinced that the 357 terminals on the U of I campus
are close to saturation in usage--a condition that would
lend strong support to Bruce's argument. The under-
utilization of plato terminals by nearly all campus
sites except cerl is in my mind a "passive" rather than
"active" abuse of the system.

To Frye:
    My point in the library analogy is that the model
presented by the University Library is one plato should
attempt to emulate. The State of Illinois would not think
of allocating funds to departments to establish restricted
departmental libraries. For reasons that are unclear to
me they have chosen to follow this course of folly with
plato. I hope this is a temporary condition.

We of course ames would like your help. As you probably
know, we are forced to use impersonal cryptic signons.
I have just had a long discussion with our course director,
Pete Boysen (coms30 - ames) and have very nearly convinced
him to revise our signon system. He would like to hear the
opinion of the sysprogs on this matter. I know several of
you definitely dislike our present system and have said you
wished it would be changed. If you are of this opinion, I
ask you to send a pnote to coms30 - ames, and tell him so.
Any and all help would be appreciated. Thank you!

---------- note 362 error
  03/20     12.49     walton       reading
Several TUTOR commands now return some value to the
lesson in the system variable -error-. For some commands
(dataset, charset, micro, for example) -error- actually
does indicate an error contition. But for some commands
(chartst, in, etc.) -error- does not indicate any error
condition, but rather a return value to the program.
For these commands, I feel that the reserved word "error"
is an improper name, and that it should be replaced with
"return", or some name which is more descriptive of its
use. Even if used for all commands, "return" could easily
be used to indicate an error, while "error" doesn't really
suggest a return value.

---------- response 2
  03/20     14.35     warner       iu

The only trouble is that everyone who uses "return" in
his define set is now going to have an erroneous lesson.
And any arrangement that switches, say, "error" for
"return" in define sets is going to run into foul-ups.
I vote to keep "error" as is: it's a minor problem.
But what I _would_ like to see is some agreement between
commands as to the "no error" or "completed" value of
error. For some commands (e.g. press) it is 0, for others
(e.g. dataset) it is-1. This makes it kinda difficult
to remember which order the error branches should go.

We would also like to see more consistency in errors and
a "return" variable of some name--when this work might get
done is another question. (Is there a convenient way to
designate new system reserved words so as not to overlap
with likely author defined variables?--"qreturn"? "Return"?)

  03/20     18.39     blomme       s

   Because of the way TUTOR's branching structure is set
up, it seems obvious that the error return variable
should be set so that -1 denotes the "good" case and
0,1,... denote the various "bad" cases.
   It all depends upon the question you think is being
answered--if you interpret the question as "Was the
operation completely successfully (free of error)" then
the return scheme advocated above fits. Some sort of
name related to words like success or completion might
be better than error to get the right sort of question
implied.
   I have felt strongly for some time that all "error"
returning commands should be standardized in this fashion.
However, even stopping the further proliferation of new
commands using the "backwards" (0=ok,negatives=errors)
logic has not been a very successful effort on my part
to date--I'd welcome more complaints/support on this.

ric's point seems to be extremely valid......

i have wondered more than once what the reasoning behind
o=ok;negatives=errors was.

how about it if all "return" values were consistant with:

        1. each other
        2. tutor branching structure

is this just natural or am i jumping to conclusions?

---------- response 7
  03/21     12.05     judy       pso

I think the VERY worst confusion arises with -charset-
and -chartst-. One returns -1 to say "yes, loaded ok"
and the other returns 0 to say the same thing.

I never ever use either without having to look them up
and see which way is which.

What does everybody think about identifying system defined
variables such as "error" and "anscnt" by some unique
notation? Bob suggested "qerror" and "qanscnt" or 
Error and Anscnt. Do you think "q" as a prefix would be
confused with "q for quit"? Perhaps "z"?

Such a change, if made, would be probably be introduced
very gradually. Remember when we switched from -line-?

And while we're at it, are there any command names which
should be changed?

---------- response 8
  03/21     12.21     friedman       csa

I agree with Rick in principle. Unfortunately, at this
stage of Tutor's development, I can't imagine an automatic
conversion if some of the uses of error were turned around.
It would be impossible to figure out what a lesson was
doing and whether some horrendous conditional should be
reversed. Reluctantly, I suggest the status quo for
existing commands that return error; for new ones, a good
convention (such as Rick suggests) would be desirable.

---------- response 9
  03/21     17.55     blomme       s

   We can of course introduce a new return variable
which gets set "correctly" as well as the current
error return and proclaim an eventual elimination to
the old (with perhaps an attempted "conversion" as
best we could at the final date of change-over).
   Another alternative I've contemplated is to introduce
parallel commands, like charst as well as charset. If
charst functioned as charset now does and we (1) converted
all charset's to charst's and (2) fixed the new charset
command to have the "proper" error returns, then we could
also proceed towards a future elimination of the old form.
   And what is the general reaction to using a special
prefix--say "z"--to ALL system reserved names? (It
does seem that "q" and "x" have acquired other sorts of
associations in TUTOR already).

---------- response 10
  03/24     10.55     friedman       csa

Main problem I can see with the prefix idea is Tutor's
hangup about assuming implied multiplication sometimes:
e.g., would "zerror" be recognized if one had defined
variables named "z" and/or "error"? Otherwise, it
sounds like a very reasonable suggestion.?
Rick, the first paragraph of your response just previous
to this one sounds fairly good, but in practice, I doubt
that you can make the suggested conversion automatically;
I believe it will inevitably require some manual recoding.
For esthetics only, I don't think it would be worth the 
effort, but......?
Consider, e.g., a -do-ne unit executed just after a 
-leslist- command; the -do-ne unit could be located far
away (physically) from the -leslist-; if you change the
results of -error- for -leslist-, how would you recognize
the -do-ne unit's use of -error- as corresponding to a
-leslist-?

---------- response 11
  03/24     10.57     friedman       csa

Making a gradual conversion, with eventual elimination
of an old feature, makes the tacit assumption that all
(or most) lessons are still being worked on by their
authors. This is not true of a large number of lessons,
and that number is growing! Therefore, I object
strenuously in principle to any solution making this
tacit assumption.

  While we're at it, how about a -sbranch- or -skip- or ???
which would skip the ¬$ of commands in the tag? Negative tags
would cause it to branch backwards. The main problem I see
with this would be continued commands, but this should be

the problem with that is that after condensing, the number

for this reason, it would hardly be feasible.

        The problem is many headed. Since -calc- type
statements are compiled, versus the interpretive nature
of the rest of TUTOR, a continued calc is defined as 1
command... Also, there are commands that you never see...
embedded writes, as a case in point. Condensed, they gen-
erate weird TUTOR commands... all the embed stuff is is a
short way to specify the commands to do the same, and,
stated simplistically, the condensor makes up the TUTOR
for you. Indeed. yeeoh and many other things...
        And if you have hopes of doing this -skip- stuff
dynamically, PLATO would have to simulate your processing
before it really DID the processing to be able to service
this... also, consider that any program writeen around
subtraction of commands would destroy the logic of the
lesson... Dave Fuller

Skips of that sort result in the situation in which it is
far too easy to write code which is erroneous (buggy).
Just imagine, for example, what happens if you have
coded "skip 15" and somewhere within those 15 commands
you later insert another command. How likely are you to
remember to change the skip to 16? It's far better to
write the labels!

In fact the original request is precisely met by "do".
write msg1
do    drawbox
write msg2
do    drawbox
...
The "do" is a branch out and the end of "drawbox"
implies a branch back to the instruction following
the "do". Since "branch" is always a subroutine call,
it is unlikely that two branches are appreciably/
faster than one"do".

It's difficult to understand why some authors continue
to write such long lessons, like 10 to 15K words of ecs.
If each terminal is allotted 1500 words for operation,
then there would have to be 10 students working simultaneously
on it in order not to overuse the ecs resourses. I think
we are running headlong into another ecs crunch. It will
reinforce the already existing cpu crunch. Happy days!

15k may be a bit extreme, but many worthwhile ideas do
require 6 to 10 thousand words for a respectable implimenta-
tion. As you say, an author must assume that several people
will use his lesson simultaneously, or we will have trouble.

On the bright side, we are not near an ecs crunch now and
the number of terminals will stop growing soon.

Basically I agree with your premise. But that 1500 words
per term. implies that all of them would run at once, which
is a long way from happening. It seems as though one can
count on 3-4000 words of ecs per user, and that's assuming
that all the terminals at one's logical site are in use.
So it seems -- I'd like to know what the real numbers are.

The numbers change slowly, but as of now, a maximum of
about 60: of the terminals are in use at 2:30pm. And
the allocation per terminal is only 1350 words. So, the

What the man is suggesting, obviously, is to arrange all

being a small, two-or-three blocker that would take less
than 1500 words. Of course, this would be an incredible
waste of disk space, but no sacrifice is too great to save

        Saturday 12 noon to 8pm

        Sunday 8am to 4pm

At these times the engineers sent in by CDC will continue
to work on the computer failure which has plagued us for

We regret all this lost time, but it is essential that they

to be a design error.

It turns out that our heavy use of ECS, with two CPUs
doing unusual things, leads to electronic situations
rarely occurring on other CDC systems. It might be that
we have detected a design flaw in the "exchange jump"
machinery. Then again, it may turn out that our
"exchange jump" machinery is faulty.

"though"; "tho" is quicker to type and occupies less

I would also be interested in an authoritative explanation.
I have deduced that: the terminal tries to evaluate
signals coming into it. When the "signal" is garbled by
static from the phone line or by the modem,
the terminal somehow says "Garbage!" and
flashes its red light. Apparently it can clear itself
(and turn off the light) and proceed with data processing,
most of the time. But when it can't clear itself, the
red light stays on, and the error button must be pressed.
I sure hope this is approximately correct, because I have
had to explain the red lights to a lot of people...

---------- response 4
  03/21     21.47     avner       s

You are quite correct. The terminal does this by checking
that the information it gets from the phone line is "legal"
(i.e.- that a special parity check bit is correct). If it
isn't, it requests a repeat from the computer. If the
computer isn't really on or if many tries to repeat are
all unsuccessful, the terminal throws up its hands and asks
for help from a friendly human (by leaving its red light on)

THERE IS NO -ok- IN THE WHOLE UNIT!!!! The first judging

   A couple things about instructor records....both of
them sort of minor, but feel they are worth mentioning,
since the way I understand it, the object of instructor
records is to make things as easy as possible for the
normal layman, who doesn't know about tutor, but must
supervise students. (example of the 'simplicity', the
thing at the end of the ECS list that says "that's all,"
and the "A lesson is only charged...etc.") One is in
regard to personal notes. There is no flag set when
an instructor receives a new personal note. Also, in
the help section of instructor options, it says to attatch
an instructor file, go into course information and type
it in...well, the instructor has no access to course
info......anyway, a couple things that could ease the
confusion.

        Since it is desirable, from a hardware point of
view. to use the arrow mechanism to process touches when
there are several alternatives to be considered, why not
make it easy to do in the case that the processing is essen-
tially the same in all cases, the only difference being a
parameter? What I'm suggesting is the analog of the
-match- command. The tag field could specify a target for
the index of the matched touch, and the trailing fields
could specify touches and tolerances, just as in the tag of
a -touch-. There would have to be some way of resolving
overlapping touch area specifications, though.

  The idea of the -block- command is to allow a method
of super fast movement of information in TUTOR.

  The overhead of looking for a possibility of a
conditional command would be couter-productive to
this idea.

  Would a conditional -transfr- command solve your
problem? The impact of a conditional on this command
would be minimal.

Block can be conditional. All you have to do is rig the
length moved to come out zero when you want to skip the
block move.

Instead of block n10,n20,n1
write       block n10,n20,-n1?expr

expr must compute to -1 for the move or 0 to skip.
Usually this means use a logical expression.

---------- note 483 more touch
  03/24     09.22     silver       ve

Another note about touch commands: how about a set of com-
hands to enable touch to be programmed as the function keys
are now, e.g.:
test    alpha
        201,3,1=back
        233,3,1=data
The back and data commands following the test would set
pointers normally, but the touch key values for 201,3,1
would activate back, as well as back, and data would func-
tion similarly.
I can't see that this scheme would involve any more pro-
cessing than the programming involved to get this effect
now, and parallel key and touch programming could be done
with a minimum of time and ecs.

Could this sort of thing be done?

---------- response 1
  03/24     11.53     judy       pso

Your comment confused at least one person. What you mean
is that when a person touches the area defined by
touch 201,3,1
then that touch should be interpreted as -BACK-. Right?

Maybe what we need is a kind of microtable for "touch"
keys. Sometimes it would be handy to use the kind of
equivalences one gets from a microtable to stuff words
into the judge buffer for use with an-answer-.

Then making a particular touch be equivalent to BACK or
DATA would be a special case with function keys, just as
it is with the current microtable.

---------- response 2
  03/24     12.50     warner       iu

What I believe we need are commands -tgroup-and -ogroup-
which produce groups, which then can be used by -pause-
and -jkey-, out to touch and ext commands. Example,
unit   toucher
tgroup center;8,8;9,9;9,8;9,9
tgroup up;10,8;10,9;11,8;11,9
tgroup down;6,8;6,9;7,8;7,9
ogroup gadget,01045,01046
       ^.=.
^.=. ?^?^displays????
	enable
pause       keys=center,up,down,gadget
keytype     n40,center,up,down,gadget
writec      n40,,You hit the middle!,Too high,Too low,
            Your external device went on

This coding would solve the -match- problems. To solve the
problem of touch jkeys, have the jkey command at an arrow
allow tgroups.

---------- response 3
  03/24     13.34     silver       ve

Sorry if I confused anyone, and I think Judy's idea of
using a microtable might accomplish more than what I sug-
gested. I like the tgroup, idea, too.
Generally, I think that tutor commands -- the ones we have
now -- should handle touch inputs as much like regular
keyset inputs as possible! If micro tables or special de-
fine sets have to be set up to do the job efficiently, fine,
just so touch panel commands are considered part of what
Plato does, and taken into account when judging commands
are written. The problem with force firsterase, described
in a reply to the matchtouch note, is typical of how the
situation stands, now.

Two things are possible:
One is to -block- the real variables in which the segments
are stored. The segments will go along! Honest!
The other, if you happen to have 6 or 12 bit segments,
is to use -move-, Move will work fine if you just define
a variable as the one at which the segments being.

---------- response 2
  03/24     17.59     blomme       s

   As someone else remarked regarding the *blockc*
request, the block (and transfer) commands use ecs as
an intermediary in order to do a super fast movement of
data. They are specifically designed to take advantage of
the special capabilities available on this machine.
   We could, of course, implement a specialized "sub-
division" of the command which would be called into play
to handle segments, but this would be very slow (and
also painful to write) in comparison to the full word
movement routine.

Depending on the amount of data you are storing in your
8-bit segments relative to the number of times they need
to be moved, it might very well be worth increasing the
segment size to 12-bit and using the *move* command.?
(Remember that the move command can have variable arguments
so that even a form such as:?
move nc1, (start-1) ?2,nc1, (dest-1) ? 2,length?2?
is legal with start, dest, and length having values on the
order of 100 or so [or higher],)

A suggestion for the present common editor:
At persent in order to totally destroy a block of common,
ensure its denstruction, and replace it with a new block,
one must press the letter of the common, followed by:
        LAB1
        NEXT1
and     HELP1
This sequence is necessary to destroy both the ECS copy
and the disk copy of a common. Why not either:
branch LAB1 to the same page after aborting common
    (with a sign saying ABORTED) _or_:
cause HELP1 to both abort and destroy the common.

been very useful to me, especially in centering text and
displays. There are two little things that bother me about
the lesson, however.
        First, why not modify the lesson so that it can
handle non-integer  -size-s? This is done in ID, so it
must be possible.

        Second, it would be very nice if, instead of giving
up when a command which cannot be handled is encountered,
the lesson just ignored it and went on. This is also done
in ID and it is useful and convenient indeed.

        I realize that I could get these features by using
ID, but that formatting aid does not allow one to move por-
tions of the display--which is _very_ nice to be able to do.

            HARDWARE PROBLEM DISCOVERED!!!!

If the touch panel has been enabled (-enable- command
executed), the terminal will occasionally issue a phony
touch input (key=0777) even if there is no touch panel on
the terminal. This is a hardware problem and should be
reported in "repair" if it happens to you.

You may have noticed the problem as:
        mysterious incorrect touch inputs
        unexplainable "next" presses

If you don't have a touch panel, but sometimes use lessons
which provide for optional use of the touch panel, the
problem would arise as mysterious "next" presses.

Programming schemes which immediately disable the touch
panel following as input, or which ignore key = 0777 inputs
may not be plagued by this bug. Even so, it is probably a
good idea to get your terminal fixed. It is a design error.

but this poses problems while in the insert mode,

I realize that trying to find the current screen location
is a mess if there are carriage returns in the text.
There are other sources of the problem which might be
fixed by simply moving the replace/insert arrow down a line
or two.
     Consider the screen situation if your text consists of
full 120 character "lines"...i.e. as one might do trying to
save disk space writing "defines", "vocabs",etc.. Those
long lines also confuse the editor and results in the
overwriting problem.  (this was in fact the problem which
prompted Fay's note)

dots at other commonly plotted positions (i.e. the edit .

     Newer versions of the panel are far less susceptable to
the "burning-in" problem than the early versions. Note that
the effect observed should never be totally missing dots
(that is another problem, which in some cases can be
repaired) but rather a dimming of dots (a deposit is being
formed on the inner surface of the panel.). In many cases
the dimming goes away by itself if that portion of the
screen is not used as much.
        For those interested, this sort of problem (i.e.,one
that shows up only after long periods of actual use) is
exactly why PLATO is being tested in a "real-life"
environment. Your comments and complaints are a valuable
contribution to the final design of the system.

        Glen Shafer, our resident plasma panel expert, has
corrected one of my earlier statements. A burned in dot
requires a higher voltage to be ignited than a less used
dot. A partial cure for a burned-in panel is to raise the
the panel voltage until all dots ignite satisfactorily.
  However, if the panel is not evenly burned-in,
raising the voltage high enough to insure that all dots
will fire may cause some other dots to stay on. Thus, it is
the case that missing dots can be the (indirect) result of
a panel being unevenly burned in (since the voltage cannot
be adjusted high enough to fire all dots without causing
some to be left on). This is one case of missing dots that
cannot be corrected. Future panels should not have this
problem. Al Avner

     I have developed an interface to connect an RS232
compatible device to the external jack of a "new" (serial
number > 262) PLATO terminal. Currently I am using this
interface to drive an ASCII printer. The interface buffers
the external bits and upon receiving data ready from the
terminal, the interface transmits the bits at RS232 voltage
levels at 1200 Baud (the actual Baud rated is 1260, but this
presents no problem for most ASCII devices.) All 15 bits
of the external are transmitted from the interface to the
connected device, This allows the interface to be used
with 5,6,7 or 8 bit characters. A tutor unit to convert and
transmit a "line" of PLATO characters via my interface
to an ASCII printer is also available. Contact me through
notes and I will answer questions about the interface.

   I am not clear as to whether a hardware or software

to the terminet printer (s) we provide service to. The
system provides a printer service lesson which will
permit print-outs to be made of lessons on certain types
of printers connected to the external jack of a PLATO
terminal. The people in the research group here at
CERL (in particular, Fred Ebeling) have built several
(hardware) interfaces for this sort of purpose.

        As I understand it, the system support for terminet
printers involves the use of an old (serial number <262)
terminal and a modification to the terminet printer. The
parallel external is wired to the input of the terminet
printer at TTL  voltage levels. What is being described
here is a self contained box which plugs into the external
output and plugs into the terminet printer (or any other)
RS232 voltage levels (+12 and -2 volts). This means
that any RS 232 device can be connected to the external
output with any needed combination of start and stop
bits desired.
        We are working on a modification of the conversion
of the terminet conversion tables for use with out new
plato terminal.

The new code is just the old reversed and start and stop
bits or'd in where needed. The box is quite inexpensive
(under $60 with its power). Because the external jack
can look like any RS232 terminal. it may be possible to
connect the external output to the terminal input for a
minicomputer and dump binary data to floppy disk or
9 track magtape. We are still investigating this
but we have sufficient need for number crunching binary
data acquired on plato that we will almost certainly
develop the needed software.
        As I understand it, this interface and any software
developed for it overlaps the existing terminet, but does
not use an old terminal. Also this interface is more
versatile and promises to have a wider application.

The circuitry in use requires milliamps and the power supply

  Besides, your password gives you a chance to

Although there is merit to your suggestion, the major

on all his student year after year, not the author who
needs data on a few students only while he develops the
lesson. Course dependent datafiles file this need, and
let the author look only at data from students he wanted
in the lesson, so he can know something of their backgrounds

Except that, for the average instructor not familiar with
the internal construction of a lesson that he uses or the
concepts used in TUTOR, the current measures collected by
the datafile package do not meet the need for _summative_
data. The PEER group has constantly maintained that the
area measures are formative data. useful primarily to the
author. The data needs of instructor are, in my own
opinion, not met by the system package, but only by groups
which have either written statistical packages which process
-outputl- commands or have devised procedures not based on
the system data-collection machinery at all.

It is an entirely different question whether it is possible

Yes -- the area data (etc.) are primarily useful to authors
in evaluating their lessons. Having a course-specific
data file, however, provides an easy way of identifying
the students who generate any given data.
Presumably an author ought to be able to make arrangements
to get data on use of his lessons from any instructor
to whom he has given permission to use the lessons.

Just as a general comment, it seems like the student data
collection was created with the assumption that lessons
would be used by students in the same course as the lesson
author.

The reason we're running into problems is because we are
producing curricula (including PLATO courseware) for general
sale and consumption. As a result, the lessons will be
used by a large number of different courses, and we will
not be running any actual classes of our own (other than
pilot testing). With the current set-up, we have to do all
sorts of dataset manipulation, and still can't do all we
want because of the limit on I/O in -finish- units.

Could it be possible in the course records editor for
a course director to change the security code (_not_ the
password) of a student or author? This would be handy in
two ways:
1) to give restricted access by student to datasets
   for which the change code is not available in the
   lesson, due to the structure of the codewords, and
2) to allow a course director to give an author
   temporary access to a file he does not normally
   have access to, without telling him the code.

Any chance of changing the execution key on the Q and SS
directives in the editor to a shifted key?

Hitting Q4 instead of A4 kills the save buffer.

Hitting SS takes you on a guided tour of the system.
Ideally, I think D, E, Q and SS all ought to be initiated
by HELP1. (Disagree with you there, George; they all
destroy something, be it source code or the save buffer).)

Main thing here is to require conscious (but trivial)
effort to execute such a directive. I agree with this
point, Gary. On the other hand. typing (e.g.) D when you
meant E could have very bad effects; also AA for SS could
easily screw things up (the 2nd A, of course, would be
discarded). On the other hand. having several different
execution keys would make them all hard to remember.?
I have a different suggestion: Make it necessary to
type in A, SS, D, and E as shifted letters. (Currently,
they may be either shifted or not.) Then use NEXT as
the execution key for A and SS, and HELP1 for D and E.
This would require the desired conscious effort.
(It still wouldn't solve AA for SS, though.)

---------- response 2
  03/27     11.01     michael       english

Fine with me. Big problem currently is that the editor
is so slow that doing U searches often drops the directive,
causing the first recognized letter in the unit name to be
interpreted as a directive, with very disconcerting results.
Unfortunately, the solution here probably lies outside the
editor itself.

I am curious about what is involved in obtaining lesson

ask is because We have so long a delay in getting space.
I have lessons already written in Coursewritter III
that I can translate into plato easily but  i cann't get
the space when I need it. I have three programmers waiting
for space. Please tell me if there is a problem that
I am not aware of and I will try to be more patient.

I would agree with Judy even for "informative" or "warning"

I don't think I agree, Al. Some system warnings are
generated for items which are not likely to become
dangers through system changes (The warning may have
been generated due to a system change--e.g., the warning
of redefining a system variable.). While I do want to
see these messages displayed to the author (or anyone
else who condenses the lesson with the change or inspect
code), I think it is unwise to try to set up for all authors
the criterion that a 'finished' lesson ought not to generate
any error or warning messages. (I also see no need for these
messages to be displayed to every author who condenses the
lesson.)?
(I have only given one example of a possible reason for
not correcting conditions which generate warning messages
but there are others which I consider valid and which
sometimes even generate error messages.)

  Something that I happened to find quite by

passwords from paying eyes.

  Make up a ten character password, then when
other people are in a position to observe you.
type it in and add one or two characters to 
the end. Plato seems to ignore anything over
ten characters as a password. Most people
remember the last thing they saw the best, and
and even if they get the first part of it right,
they will think there is still some to be added.

  Actually, any change could be made by simply changing
the keys physically on the keyboard, since all character
echoing and processing are a software function. As on other
systems, you could have some type of code designating
different types of terminals (left-right handed, new-old
keyboard format etc...)
  All this would have to be done at the driver level. so
you'd have to ask a systems programmer.

  03/30     00.20     gilpin       peer

A number of recent observations suggest to me that a new
category of record for junior authors would be useful,
Such a record might have the power to edit only the file
assigned to it by the course director, to inspect files
according to the usual rules, to read Notes but not to
write them (except, in the new system, Tutor Questions
--or, maybe, Junior Authors),
to use consult (maybe) but not talk, to look at nothing as
a student but its own file ¬ aids, and to neither receive
nor send personal notes.
        I realize that there are good reasons for trying
not to multiply the different kinds of records there are,
but I believe the benefits of a junior author type record
are overriding. Mainly, it would allow the desirable PLATO
tradition of self-selected young people teaching themselves
TUTOR to continue on a decentralized basis while holding
system costs of that activity within reasonable bounds.

  What exactly would be the savings to system load
by creating such a user-type? ECS, CPU or both?

  And how would this type of signon effect this savings?

---------- response 2
  03/30     00.56     giplin       peer

Here's three--the loss of cpu to game-playing by "irregular"
authors would drop to zero; the loss of time fending off
frivolous talk-calls would drop to near-zero; the disk space
and accesses consumed by "noteswar" would sharply decrease.
And the fact that the people would be screened out whose
ONLY interest in PLATO is screwing around would work a
general improvement in PLATO working conditions.
        But the thrust of my suggestion is not the savings
for the system--those it seems are going to come anyway--
but rather the preservation of the named tradition to the
greatest extent possible.

   Not too many months ago I suggested this same type of
signon. I now consider it to be a mistake. There are too
many people on this system who would like to turn us all
into junior authors, and I don't think that the precendent
should be set.
   Beyond this, I believe that this would place a load
on the course directors, who are on the whole too busy
as it is, to be truly effective.

I'm sure that the idea of a junior-author type record has
been considered many times. But I think recent changes in
system experience make it worth considering again. As Bruce
Sherwoord, Stan Smith, Bill Golden, and others have observed
recently in these Notes, the new scarcities in system re-
sources, especially cpu, no longer allow us to tolerate
practices that were readily absorbed previously. The intent
of my suggestion at this time is to make it possible to put
a lid on those practices while retaining as much of the old
freedom as possible.
        Course directors would _benefit_ from this--they would
be able to give signons to promising persons with much less
supervisory burden than now. And they would have a means of
disciplining an employed author who abused his privileges
that stopped short of pulling that author's record entirely.

You seem to feel, John, that the tradition of learning
Tutor with author records is threatened by the scarcity of
the system resources (as described by Mr. Golden and
others). You therefore propose to preserve this tradition
by created a "junior author" user type restricted in its
use of some system resources. Your response to bowery's
question says we will gain cputime spent in frivolous use
of term talk, gamesplaying, and gain diskspace consumed by
noteswar.
        This assumes that frivolous term talks, gamesplaying
and noteswar are done mainly by new authors learning Tuto
I do not believe this is the case. Furthermore, I doubt
that noteswar consumes a significant portion of our disks
or that frivolous term talk a significant portion of total
cputime.
        Additionally, such a junior author would be unable
to study instructional techniques utilized by other authors.

The new author who inquired a while back about sized or
rotatable FONT characters would be unable to utilize
Dave Eisenberg's program to do this.

        Finally, one of your responses implies that
junior author signon could be used as a disciplinary mea-
sure. This would seem contrary to the stated purpose of
junior author records: to learn Tutor.

        I do feel, however, that a definite curriculum for
new authors could be created. This curriculum should not
only include instruction in the Tutor language, but also
in author resources, how to use the editor, and reasoning
behind current system philosophy on games-playing during
primetime, storing notes in your notesfile forever, and
whatever other stuff is frowned upon. Perhaps this curri-
culum could be attached by a course director to a new
author's records; the new author would then go thru all
this material before...

being turned loose on the system. Perhaps it wont save a
great deal of system resources, but it will insure that
the new authors fully realize both the capabilities and
their responsibilities, as authors, on PLATO.
        This could be implemented thru a modification to
course records; when a new "author" signon is created, it
is automatically attached to lesson "newauths" unit "start"
(or whatever lesson sequence would contain this curriculum
of information). Once a new author has satisfactorily com-
pleted this sequence of material, he would sign into lesson
"edit" unit "start" as all authors do now. ¬[Should the
course director be creating a signon for an already exper-
ienced author, he can modify the signin lesson/unit while
from the course records editor.¬]

needs to be defined independantly...

   Erik, you are on the right track, but for what you are
saying, I think we already really have the basic resources
for making sure the 'new' author goes through certain
lesson; that being commonly referred to as the datafile.
Now what was done with me was I was told by my course-
director to go through such and such, etc (with my syfrig/iu
signon that is)., before I went around requesting space
for my lesson, and the lessons had dataons on them...
also, gilpin, for the game-playing, datafiles can
also be used to see how much time is being spent to
games in relation to hours on system. This is also a
suggestion to game authors to put datons in their games.
(Thank you Brand, for already doing that with airfight and
spasim). I don't see what a jr. author record would solve.

With the possible exception of inhibiting the use of
"notes" (which, as john [gilpin] points out, could be
handled automatically in new "notes" formats), I don't like
the idea of a "junior author".

My objections:
     1. Most of the consulting requests that I answer are
        through term "talk, and not consult. The number of
        "frivolous" talk calls I get is negligible.

     2. If a junior author can write and execute his own
        programs, he can program jumpouts to whatever game
        he chooses. I don't see how to inhibit that
         capability without a major change in the current
         jumpout rules. I would rather that didn't happen.

      3. The cost of writing personal notes in terms of
         disk accesses is trivial. The cost in terms of
         bother to the receiver is also trivial. The cost

         qualities as a communications network (and
         incidentally, an instructional tool), i.e. the
         capability to locate the need for information and

     I really can't disagree with some of the thoughts
presented here, but would rather this type of record
was labeled a "beginning author's" record. I interpret
some comments made in this series of note and responses
to mean that "junior authors," or "kids," are the ONLY
ones who practice such habits as noteswar, an excessive
amount of term talks, etc. This is not true. An
example would be the chain letter craze mentioned by
Bruce Parrello in his reponse to this note. Kids didn't
have much to do with that, it was mostly college students
and adults....

It is a FACT that control of the distribution and use of
author records is being tightened: drastic measures
such as the restriction of entire sites against all ,for-
eign, authors have been implemented, and further dras-
tic measures, such as systemwide re-registration of all
authors, are being considered. As this process continues,
it's altogether possible that access to the
system by "volunteer" authors will be centralized in cerl
or, for practical purposes, dropped altogether. The intent
my suggestion is to forestall these possibilities as long
as possible. It is, however, probably true that author pri-
vileges are abused by some regular authors. In such
cases the disciplinary use of the junior record would seem
altogether reasonable and useful. Measures that depend on
continuing surveillance are less useful and, to me, less
desirable.

   name in order to correct something silly like a mistyped
   lesson or common name, or something urgent like a unit
   too long. Since it has been requested several times that
   this be changed so it will remember the lesson name and

The "note enough ECS" message is appearing more frequently.
Each time I have tried to condense a lesson where the
necessary ECS was not available, the site wasn't even
near it full allotment,

It would be very useful if we could instead see the base
allotment, so one can see exactly how much over the allot-

multiply the number of terminals for that logical

That suggestion is good except that:

1. It's very difficult to find the exact number of
terminals on sites on the u of i campus.

2. This number changes frequently in some sites.

this type of "biorhythm" is akin to astrology--and without
offering any value judgements,  it isn't based on any
known scientific evidence.

these weird predictions must not be confused with the
precise,  fascinating study of biological clocks and
"circadian"  (daily) rhythms-- a field which is of
increasing importance to medical science and which
may even hold some of the secrets of the ageing process.

there are definitely biochemical,  physiological and
behavioral phenomena which show periodicity and cyclic
changes--  there is no evidence i know of that this
information can be applied in any beneficial way to
the making of personal plans by individuals-- despite
the wild-eyed claims of recent news articles and other

I realize this note should have appeared in help notes
originally,  but to continue the discussion...
Quetzal makes a point of saying biorythms of the astro-
logical type, and s/he is correct. Strictly defined the
fascinating circadian rythms ARE "biorythms" (Stedman's
Medical Dictonary)
The term -biorythm- is properly used in a seminar entitled
"Biorythms and human reproduction"...... So let the reader
beware that though the term "biorythm" is often misused
in the popular literature to mean something akin to astro-
logy, it is by definition a proper term which encompasses
the circadian rythm, and that every occurance of the word
should not necessarily be equated with bunk.

Your page is full, but I think it would be nice to give

for "non-breakfast" words which the student finds. After

reading a "tome" and listening to a "tune" and "scoff"ing
at a newspaper report! Really, "car" doesn't belong.)

     You'd better contact a consultant and discuss what it
is you are trying to do.
     If I were to make a guess, I'd say that you have been
using a temporary common statement and then treating
the vc variables as if they were additional student
variables. . . this technique is only viable if you
never have more than one person at a time using your
lesson, else interactions will occur.
     Additional space for storing temporary variables
associated with each student is available through the
storage command.
     At any rate, in no case are variables lost by changing
from temporary common to permanent common. You should
study carefully the write-ups in aids regarding common
and then contact a consultant to get these things
straightened out.

MICROWAVE SITES:

We have been running our microwave signal on a temporary
frequency license, which ends Saturday. The engineers
attempted to switch this last weekend, but ran into equip-
ment trouble. We have decided to put off the next
attempt until Saturday, due to interference with running
classes, and the lack of prior notification.

The microwave signal will be turned off at 10 pm Friday,
and the new transmitter will be put in service on Saturday,
if possible. In no case can we go back to the temporary
frequency. It is expected that almost all failures can be
repaired over the weekend, and all microwave sites will have
their antennas adjusted over the weekend.

If the new equipment cannot be made to work, the microwave
sites will not be able to run on Monday, nor until the
necessary repairs have been made.

How did you lose your hour's worth of work? The

And what the heck is so ambiguous about '60 seconds till

   It IS hard to understand what the problem is--please
describe in detail what work you lost and how. A normal
system 60 second warning was given and a general backout
done which should have updated any edits. If you were
not signed off the system, please let us know. System

warning and save people's work (except when a "hard"

Conceivably, "dale" could have been building a graph or
picture which needed lots of data and manipulation to
reach the final objective. In that case, there's little
that can be said. The system _does_ go down during non-prime
time and he is running a calculated risk by doing such
work during non-prime time.

I know that sometimes such work _must_ be done at night.
Perhaps we could help you plan your program (and data-
storage) so that a backout would not be so disastrous.

The terminal is self powered with nicads and is driven

System routers, general routers, ¬+ roto-routers:
I have a general question. It relates to the relative
ease of installing and the economy of space inherent in
the system router versus the much larger space required
by the separate router lesson and the individual programming
required by same. Why would it not be possible to adapt the
system router to be able to handle lessons which actually
consisted of 'mini-lessons' and which allowed conditional
'jumpouts' or 'routing' to other lessons which themselves
consisted of 'mini-lessons'? The necessary coding could be
contained in the instructional lesson space as far as the
conditional routing is concerned. Maybe even a 'mini-
lesson' command could be instituted which would tell the
system router a) the student completed a 'mini-lesson', not
the whole lessons. b) in conjunction with an 'sroute' command
[cont'd in next note]

---------- note 325 roto-contd
  04/01     13.38     fay       rtv362

could conditionally specify which lesson to go to next.
I have no objection to using a router lesson as opposed
to the system router, but since there is a limit to
the space available on the discs perhaps my proposal to
expance somewhat on the system router is not infeasible!

---------- response 1
  04/01     15.48     andersen       s

Since we plan to go to a shorter minimum lesson length in
the not too far distant future (7 block files) a mini-router
will be relatively unneccessary.

to Andersen of s: I disagree that the shorter minimum
lesson length will make the 'mini-lesson' concept invalid!
If you re-think my note you will see that the lesson length
is NOT what I am complaining about, the _router_ lesson
length _AND_ the relative complexity of same is what I am
talking about. WHY NOT MAKE THE SYSTEM ROUTER MORE
FLEXIBLE including possible 'mini-lesson' command?

---------- response 3
  04/01     18.25     michael       english

Personally, I doubt if the system router could be made
to handle complex curricula and still meet the need
for simplicity and generality. Whether ANY router
can do all three simultaneously is doubtful. We handle
125 "min-lessons" in the Community College English
Project, and after much experimentation have elected to
give instructors routing control of medium complexity
while requiring little knowledge and effort. This approach,
however, has resulted in a router which is so directly con-
nected to the instructional material and teaching techniques
used that it is not readily adaptable to other curricula.

---------- response 4
  04/01     18.55     john r       reading

Both the elementary reading and elementary math projects
have developed reasonably general routers capable of
handling quite complex lesson interconnections. At least
in the case of reading's router, the procedures are readily
utilizable by other people.

We are more than willing to share what we have, but our ex-
perience has been that other curriculum projects either
have small, reasonably linear curricula that don't need
3000 words of router overhead, or the teachers really want
to handle the routing themselves.

I am confused. I don't think we are responding to Fay's
question, and I don't think we have understood what his
question is. Fay, could you elaborate on the difference
between your "mini-lesson" and a "normal" lesson? What
is it that the system router doesn't do in terms of getting
your students to the lesson or mini-lesson of their or
your choice?

---------- response 6
  04/02     13.17     schroeder       iumusic

   I'm not trying to add anything to this particular
topic, but I do have another thing about the systems-
router.(and if I read fay's note correctly, this could
be verry indirectly related) Would it be possible to
include an option for station-control, like of who is
allwed to use a signon...system-router presently does
not have this...any hope that can be incorporated?
(one of the main reasons, I plan on writing my own
router)

---------- response 7
  04/03     14.29     fay       rtv362

To b sherwood and others to whom my question was unclear:
I would like the system router to be able to distinguish
between the "end of the entire block of space defined as
an instructional lesson" and "the end of an instructional
sequence _within_ the lesson space." In other words,
for purposes of using the system router, allow a number
of separate instructional entities within the same lesson
space. I would like the sys. router to recognize that
a) a student has reached the end of some defined material;
and b) that there is more instructional material in the
same lesson space. Basically, it is this: can we have
more that one listing on the sys. router index coming from
the same contiguous lesson space and _can_ they be treated
separately? I hope I have resolved any ambiguity regarding
my query. Tim Fay

Thanks for the clarification. David Andersen's response
was in fact appropriate--he is a better reader than the
rest of us!

If you have different pieces of a file which are different
lessons ("mini-lessons"), they should in fact be separated
into different files. Among the reasons for this is the
notion that a lesson should be as much as possible a
self-standing entity, in order to make it esy for
instructors to create curricula composed of such modules,
possibly written by different authors. Is there some
reason why distinct lessons (mini or not) must be placed
in one file space? We will not subdivide files--separate
lessons must be placed in different files.

---------- response 9
  04/03     15.29     fay       rtv362

Bruce and others: In response to respons no. 8.
The only reasons I would opt for the features outlined
in response no. 7 are:
a) To avoid requesting separate file spaces...
        i. because such a process is slow,
       ii. because such a process uses a lot of space
           (not at condense time but at least reserved
           space on the discs),
      iii. because such separate files carry some
           (admittedly small) overhead for file data
b) To avoid the necessity of having to condense a number
   of lessons in the course of events when on is all thats
   needed (in terms of space used, anyway)
I guess in the end I would like the sys. router to keep
track of things which it currently does not.

The audio disks are enclosed in the new unit. After inser-

good through 8 KHTz. New disk material eliminates the sinu-
soidal amplitude variations present as the old disks rotated
180ˆ0. New unit also uses compressed air. Unit can mechanic-

In lesson read2 (I think) is alternate charset
that contains the assignments, with micro-a represented
by a char that looks sorta like a¬n etc. so you can
read the actual charset representation right off.

There's also a charset that has the slot number
in the slot, I think.

produced by Rob Walton.

  04/03     07.29     walton       reading

Yes, folks, in read2 is a charset 'keys' which will
allow you to look at an altfont write command and tell
exactly what it is. Each key has an underline to denote
a fonted character as opposed to an unfonted character,
and the access keys have squiggles above them.

Also in read2 is charset 'keycodes7, which has the slot

These are several charsets in lesson cslibrary which I
would be quite willing to have used publicly. Some of
them have author-use micro tables for ease of use
in lesson writing; writeups are in the "how to use" blocks
of cslibrary.?
Judy, please feel free to use any of these you wish.?
One of these charsets,  "keytops", contains images of the
control keys on the right side of the Plato keyboard.
All the others include "keytops" as a subset.?
Execute lesson csauthors to see these charsets in use.

There  are capitals. The Red Sweater designed a gothic
charset with capitals (oldengchr) a long time ago but it
was destroyed for lack of space. I'm sure he would do it
again for a very small fee.

 A second charset that has the number of each slot IN each
slot is -charset proc, testnums-. This charset was made to
label points on a graph, so it has the characteristic that
each number has the same center point. The differences
from Walton's "keycodes" are that the numbers are tiny and
left-to-right rather than fairly large and top-to-bottom
("keycodes" is easier to read, especially the higher
numbers). Anyone who wishes to use testnums is welcome to
do so.

when using the U option (list of on-sys users) could we have
the option of specifying only one site or maybe initializing
the site¬$ at which the list starts -- for someone who wants

the -readr- command is fabulous; but i can think of one

could we get the course directory? perhaps something like,
readr directory;nc1,100

nc1 etc..

i foresee offering a teacher a roster page and letting her
choose the students she wants to looks at; such a page would
have to be as up to date as the course roster; and it would
seem best not to have to generate such a page by picking

Mr. Lionel:
        Perhaps you may not have noticed that since the end
of February there have been 15 New Systems Features notes,
some of them announcing several new features--including,
among others, autobreakable judging, help on the same page,
and -dataout-s in finish units. Or that since the end of
February there has been exactly ONE system crash due to
software. The systems people work their butts off and are
continually supplying new goodies both on their own initia-
tive and in response to user requests. They do this while
at the same time making deep changed in the system that you
never hear about to run >500 terminals. If on occasion they
seem to have a deaf ear for users, it may be that *ss-h*le
communications like these of yours have something to do
with it.

as a 4000 terminal system, easily programmed by the

    Mr. Lionel's notes are so very offensive precisely
because he was not _making_ any request--he was merely heaping
some very ill-placed scorn.
    To the extent that you have a point, it is not one that
is usefully addressed to systems--there is nothing they
can do that they are not already doing--very responsibly
and capably. If you feel you have a justified gripe along
the lines you mention, the have your administrators talk
to our administrators about it. If you just want to vent
frustration, find another outlet; notes like Mr. Lionel's
are biting the hand that's keeping your head above water.

If Mr. Lionel feels he is so competent to judge systems

system. The system staff is doing a remarkable job
given the constraints of the system, and asinine notes
such as yours serve no purpose but to antagonize these
people. I find it inconceivable that people actually
exist that think like Mr. Lionel must.

out of hearing and reading distance of other users of the

     I am very sorry if I gave the impression that I
thought that the systems people weren't doing a good job.
That was not my intention at all!
     My comments were supposed to be humorous, with no
malice intended. I feel that PLATO has the best user-
systems interaction of any computer system I have seen,
and that the systems people bend over backwards to please
the users.
     The basis for my "sarcasm" was a request of mine
a while back, that, on the admission of a "s" person, would
only require one -writec- in the editor, but the "s" people
had no time for such trivialities. Great! There have been
lots of nice new features added that are taking up their
time. It just bothered me a bit, that little changes like
the one I commented on in this note, are on the same level
as my previous suggestion (a condense flag indicator
on the edit page).

     One day, I noticed the small editor change and
decided to comment on it. Having seen a great deal
of user requests answered with "It's at the bottom of
our priority list. We have much better things to do.",
I wondered if the aforementioned trivial change was one
of them. So, I wrote a very small bit of sarcase, agreed.
     I certainly did not expect for my comments to backfire,
and produce such negative reactions. I apologize to all
who I offened, and would welcome an exchange of thoughts
with them, hopefully being able to erase any ill feelings
that may have arisen.

How about a new option?
When you are preparing to leave your lesson via a jumpout,

Do I miss something? That doesn't seem to make sense.?
Common is attached to a lesson, not to a student. So if
the student is leaving the lesson, and there are other
students in the lesson, the common MUST remain; if no
other students are in the lesson, then both lesson and
common are no longer charged to the student's site.?
?router common, of course, MUST stay in ecs as long as
the router lesson is in ecs, i.e., as long as any student
is being routed by that router lesson.

---------- response 2

Well, we only have one terminal, so when that student leaves
everybody is out. But is there any reason why the router
common couldn't be removed from ECS when it is no longer
needed? (I know it's impossible now, but could it be
made possible at some future date?)
Or if the leslist command could be made executable, so that
I could load a new leslist after already loading one, I
could save 644 words of common right there.
I've heard talk of this but never heard if it was going to
come through.

The leslist command is executable, but once it has been
executed, a 2nd one won't work, but will return a value
in error. However, once the router jumps out to an
instructional lesson, the leslist is detached, so that
a leslist command must be executed again in the endlesson
and error units of the router; this new leslist command
command need not specify the same leslist as the first one.?
I don't think you'll ever get a command that will detach a
common. In a router, when the student re-enters the router
at the endlesson or error unit, the common is presumed to be
needed again. Anyway, special features for one-terminal
sites don't make sense; except as an experiment or a demo,
one terminal sites are uneconomical. I can't imagine
treating them as a permanent aspect of Plato. [The last
two sentences are obviously my personal opinion.]

running (and perhaps to send messages) but not to

a separate security word would be required to exercise

I have a problem: I do not like to 'kick' people off my
lesson when I try to condense new material, even though
they may be 'unauthorized' or 'non-preferred' users. I
should say, I don't like to kick them off without issuing
a warning to that effect so that they know why they got
bumped. A couple of possibilities exist: an automatic
system response to users in such situations (much like
backout warnings issued by sysprogs), or a manual option
available to the author attempting condense.
        I have found in most cases that I cannot reach
users outside my course via the talk option (probably
turned off, etc). I welcome comments.

A fairly simple, non-system solution to this (which I often
make use of) is to use a common var as a flag that can
be turned on or off (perhaps by a hidden, -term-ed unit)
with a conditional write in an imain unit containing
whatever warning you want to give.
      If you want to get fancy, you can even enter the message
itself in common, to fit varying conditions.

You can put a message system in the imain unit (must be
stored in common to do this) that on message lenght
(gotten from jcount in a storea) longer than 1 (or two)
mode rewrite at 3201 showa message,message lenth
otherwise branch around it... This gives a message
that appears exactly like that of a systems message
and allows variability of message. When editing, I
would have "author editing". Before recondensing,I
would put " one minute before recondense of lesson"...

i'd like to revive the discussion about a "low priority"
flag for lessons which would give them a decreased
lien on system resources.

this is prompted by the observation that, although i
have not condensed for at least five hours. i am
now 54 of 76 in the condense queue as plato comes
up with a new version, while most of my students
were able to condense moonwar, dogfight and trek
with gleeful ease. i may be a sore looser but this
sort of condensor roulette doesn't seem fair to
those who are willing to try to work at odd hours
in order to improve their chances and the work load
distribution on the system. the same applies in spades
for cpu time in high use rate hours!

again, i am NOT against games-- i am FOR priorities.

can it be done?

---------- response 1

Only one (1) of them condensed it....others entered
a condensed lesson. Since students usually condense rarely,
they get high priority. If what you're asking for is a
flag attached to the lesson which says to the condensor
"I'm unimportant; get me last." -- who attaches such a
flag? Lesson owner? Systems? You?

User-associated priority seems fairer than lesson-associated
scheme.

        We too here in Conn. have been concerned with
designating low priority usage as such, and have spent
several months trying several approaches. Currently, we
combine local control of priorities (3 levels) on a lesson
by lesson basis. Should a routed student be unable to
condense a lesson due to an ecs shortage, the router will
attempt to obtain sufficient ecs by "deleting" (pressing
stop1) a student running at a lower priority. A full
description of the router may be read by condensing lesson
-danwork-.

     Unfortunately, we can only deal with the ecs short-
age. We hope to find a way to establish and implement
locally priorities for cpu usage. We've looked into
-cpulim- and it does not appear to be usable in the same
fashion. Any systems staff comments?

     A problem (although not an error) does exist with the
new site restriction options. It was formerly possible
to restrict specific courses from using terminals at a
site. This is no longer possible. All that can be done
is to specify a list of courses that CAN sign-on...so it
is really more of an "allow" list rather than a
"restriction" list.

     Thus, to inhibit 1 or 2 courses entails listing
perhaps as many as 10 to 100 or more courses that
are allowed. And then, if someone else in yet another
course tries to sign-in, he will recieve the message you
got. Seems in some respects to be a step backward.

specified wasn't immediately apparent, to me, at least.
     There does seem to be one option that is no longer

ability to inhibit an individual user's records at a site...
useful in the case of abuse by just one person in a course.

Osborne,
     I presume you found that the machine we are running
on (CDC 6500) doesn't have an integer divide hardware
instruction. For tutor to perform an integer divide
with truncation (as in Fortran) whenever you said
n1/n2 for example, would take longer than just doing
the divide. Additionally, you are probably aware
that using a truncating integer divide would bother
students whenever they used, for example, 3/4 to mean .75.

Just saw all this after already responding (politely, I

One comment here--the speed of doing integer divides on
this particular machine has nothing to do with the fact
that 3/4 is 0.75 instead of 0. Rather it seems that
3/4 SHOULD mean 0.75, as mentioned by White. Moreover, we
(I) refuse to differentiate between 3.0/4.0 and 3/4. Both
forms really must be treated equivalently. Other computer
languages have bizarre, non-intuitive conventions in this
area, and in fact typically handle mixed-mode expressions
poorly if at all, partly as a result of the poor treatment
of things like 3/4.

One would question why there are two types (n and v) in tutor
if you always end up with a floating point number anyhow.
Also , i might add, it makes more sense to have it with
truncation from a scientific standpont, i.e., signigicant
digits. 7/5 _IS_ i to one sig fig, the number of sig figs
in both arguments. For that matter, if you insist on
floating point numbers......3/4 would only be .8
not .75 without injecting a degree of accuracy neither
argument possessed.

Well, 7/5 truncates to the correct 1-significant-figure
result. Now, about 9/5...
       The basic point is, if you want 3/4 to be 1, Tutor
gives you that with no fuss; if you want 3/4 to be .75,
Tutor gives you THAT with no fuss; if you want 3/4 to be .8
(or 0) Tutor gives you that with little fuss. Compare with
the parallel cases in other implementations. [And do take

Could someone _please_ change the explanation in AIDS of the
vertical segments. I had to write two help notes before
I thought I understood it and now I find that I didn't
really understand it at all. (And now have to modify most
of my lesson.) One major point not even mentioned is what
number to use in the lesson to index the variable. (if. calc
vertseg (???)?1) I thought the no. started with the no. of
the var. in the define statement and my lesson ran fine
until I decided to set my variables to values other than 0.
Please don't let anyone else go thru what I am now.

We will look at "vertical segments" and meditate about your
problem. Maybe an example is all that is needed.

But, at the risk of sounding rude, it sounds to me as if
you made (unintentionally) a colossal blunder. I'm not sure
a fuller explanation would have helped. Secondly, "aids"
really can't afford to explain the philosophy of indexed
variables for indexed vars, and then for segments, and again
for vertical segments. It makes it too unwieldy for the
"ordinary" user.

What you really should do (should have done?) was start
at the beginning of "define" and read all the way through.
That way you should have found out how indices work, before
you arrived at "vertical segments".

      I think a display showing several consecutive words
and marking the bits that are used in the vertical segments
would help. When I first read the write up on vertical
segments,I couldn't think of any reason why anyone would
possibly need to use vertical segments over regular segs.
     Possibly the display would have several vert. segs.
in these consecutive words showing ow useful it is
for storing tables when some of the segments might have
to be of different lengths and maybe greater then 30 bits
long.

It might help to give relative speed differences between
segment; segment,vertical; and standard word addressing.
It might suprise some and help others who worry about
keeping ECS down as much as possible but also maximizing
effective use of the cpu....

        Lesson alarm is a good feature and I appreciate
it. The hypnotic effect of PLATO can make one lose track
of time.
        What I would appreciate is something stronger
like a full screen erase followed by size 3 writing

As I understand the relative importance of alarm to the

At one time, it may have made sense to consider the student
room (203b¬D165) as the basis of PLATO. However, this is no
longer the case. Only a small percentage of all terminals
are located in 165. Nevertheless, the operators still find
it necessary to delete and inhibit lessons (yes, _game_
lessons) system-wide in order to clear game-players off so
that students may use terminals. Now, if the operators are
simply taking the easy way out by clearing the room this
way, then action should be taking against them. If they do
not (and I am not familiar with site options) have the
ability to inhibit lessons and to back off only one certain

Here is an interesting "feature??" of TUTOR:

It would seem that the ¬, is as close to the universal
delimiter as one could come. But this delimiter does not
work with -putd-. Aids makes no mention of this, and its
use as a delimiter in many other commands makes it a likely
choice in a -putd- where one would normally want to use
some of the usual delimiters (puntuation marks) as fields
to be -putd-ed.

Is this intentional, and why? Can it be fixed?

In answer to response 2:
    The signon I humbly suggest differs from a student
and/or multople in that the user would have the highest
priority for deletion when a student is attempting to
condense a lesson but cannot do so without kicking out
someone else. As far as I know this would not be possible
with a student or multiple signon.
    The system at some times can support game players (i.e.,
4 a.m.). An appropriate cpu limit could be set on this code
to prevent excessive use of high_TIPS games for instance,
cpulim?2000/tactive). I can count the really high-cpu games
on my ten fingers.

    Another advantage of this signon could be that games
could be inhibited to all codes save this one=====_====_ ____ ___. Thus authors
trying to do condense their own lessons for testing would
have a lower deletion priority then games players.

The system router doesn't collect such stats (re question

abuse out of sample is to keep games out of it. I can't
see keeping people out of sample altogether just because
of vultures. We have game playing under control over here
because of the stud signon. They can't get on when there

This is a general principles sort of response.
The machine should (given resources) be available to all
students, not only those in specific courses, and for all
purposes, not only lessons. Just like a library. The catch
is the "given resources". If PLATO can allocate resources
sensibly, as the note suggests, it should. Anyone who has
been to Dartmouth knows the idea works, if the school will
support the system as necessary. There, at least, games do
not significantly impact total system availability. It's
a much better philosophy than that seen around PLATO.
The machine is a school resource; it should not be
restricted unless necessary, and then only as necessary.
Even here there are times when it just isn't necessary.

---------- note 17 "key"
  04/05     23.31     telson       arizona

after a little testing, i have found
that after a -catchup- the system variable
"key" contains the alpha "b2", octal 0235.
this happens regardless of what "key" was before.
why should this be?

---------- response 1
  04/05     23.51     parrello       uimatha

The catchup key is pressed. (See -aids-, under "key names"
if you don't believe there is such a thing.)

---------- response 2
  04/06     10.30     b sherwood       s

And notice in the aids discussion that "key" is actually
a 10-bit (!) key-code. 2 bits for key source (keyset,
touch panel, external input) and 8 bits of data (only 7
come from the terminal in the case of real keyset keys,
but a translation is done to make function keys and
"software" keys such as catchup have codes bigger
than 0200).

So 0235 does not mean o02 followed by 035, but rather
the software key 0235, which is catchup.

 Would it be possible to have a system variable that would
show how bust the cpu is (like the size of the time slice)
I think this would be a great help to game authors and
the authors of other high cpu lessions so that they may
deny access when the cpu time is tight.

        I think that this would be an ideal feature, with
the current CPU crunch. Now that the ECS crunch has
been relieved, router people now have to worry about
the usuage of the CPU in deciding the load on the system.

        A reserved word will help in the task.

---------- response 2

  I believe that there are numbers like this available.
(ie: cpu idle time for each cpu) Of course these
numbers would have to be updated constantly by a sample-
taker of some type if one does not already exist.
This maybe too much overhead for a mere reserved word.

i have just received an announcement which may be
of some general interest. The 2nd world conference,
"IFIP: Computers in Education" will be held in Marseilles
1-5 September 75. It is too late to submit papers but
there are tons of time to register. I wonder if:

1. anyone knows of any plans to show plato live?
2. if there will be any papers regarding plato? ticcit?

the official preliminary program shows invited papers
from the USA to be by A. M. Bork, A. Luerhmann, and
P. Suppes, but there will be many additional unsolicited
papers.

strangely enough, there is scheduled a paper by a
J. Nivergelt from Switzerland. any relation to a

The thrust of Prof. Nievergelt's paper is to say that
rather than talking about CAI in isolation, it makes more
sense to talk about interactive systems in general, no
matter how used. That is, a highly interactive system
can be used in various ways, as is PLATO (tutoring and
testing students, handling communications among users,
providing computational and information services, etc.).
He discusses how the use of such systems is likely to
develop in the future. Except for using PLATO as an
example of an interactive system, the paper is fairly
general. He does briefly discuss computer science teaching
on PLATO. Good paper!

As to other PLATO participation, Dr. Alpert is scheduled to
discuss the PLATO military training program at the
conference, if I am not mistaken.

        There was a discussion in "old" general interest
note 459, entitled -priorities-, which was dated 4/3 with
several responses left after that date, which was delegated
to the archives upon the recent re-initialization of those
notes.

        I had hoped to keep that discussion going. Please
take a look at it. The note and its replies discuss the
need for setting priorities upon lessons given a limited
resource such as the condensor, and methods for implement-
ing lesson priorities within a router (responses 4 + 5).

   Same goes for the student data file. It seems rather
inconsistent to have some system lessons having this
ability and some do not. I would like to see the "enter
a new password" option in course records act similar to
the DATA page in a tutor lesson. In other words. all
system lessons should ask for the password _twice_ any time
any password is being changed.

I noticed at approximately 9:45 this evening (Sunday,
April 6, 1975) that due to some unfortunality that there
would be a new PLAT loaded. Not knowing exactly what a
PLAT was, I assumed that this must either be :?
       1. A typo caused by many hours of frustrating
          hard work by one of our diligent systems
          programmers or,?
       2. An experimental system being brought up by one
          of those beforementioned people.?
No sooner had I thought out these possibilities then was
the system up and running again, but to my surprise the
signon page was again changed (from its other "new" face)
to another one indicating that this system would be slightly
unstable.
       I realize that this is a nice feature but a little
redundant since anyone editing after 10pm is unstable
anyway...

You asked for it!

As I understand it, "a" is used before words which begin
with a written vowel, but a pronounced semi-vowel, e.g.
[j]  (which is the phonetic representation of the first
sound of the word "you" or "yet").

So one naturally says "a Ukrainian" and " a usurpation"
but "an elephant".

      More on A/AN:
      Glides act funny as well as semivowels; for example:
      The H sound in English is a (voiceless) vowel
phonetically, but a consonantal phonemically. Most
Americans pattern it phonemically when producing A/AN
before an initial  H, and most other English speakers
treat it phonemically there; but there are exceptions:
hence 'a/an historian.'
      You do hear ' an Ukrainian' for similar reasons.
      Neither is either right or wrong.

There was a very minor change on the choose a password
page so that it no longer says anything about a maximum
length of 10 characters. You see. (if you look back in

   I noticed something strange about the student data
collection routines. On datafile entries such as "help
keys pressed", the routines ordinarily place the name of
the unit in the entry. If the key was pressed in the IEU,
the unitname that appears apparently is the last unit ever
executed in that lesson.
   Could this be changed so that if it was the IEU, maybe
the unitname could read something like: ****ieu****

     This is a re-request of a feature I think would be
helpful:

     Add to the editor, a flag which indicates whether
the block you are editing has its condense flag set or not.

     Example: The top of a block display now is--

       BLOCK a = start SPACE = 259

    If this block were set to NOT condense, it would show--

***  BLOCK a = start SPACE = 259

     When one is working on a new version of an existing
block, the condense flags get changed often. It is easy to
forget the status of the flag, and I will sometimes stop1
condense without the blocks I want being condensed.  I think
that this feature would save a lot of condenses. Comments?

But should you only be brought back to the block directory
page if the block is partialled out? It seems to me that
(not only in the case where you have just created a new
block) if you are about to condense and are not sure exactly
what blocks are condensed then the first thing you would do
is to check the block directory page. But still, considering
the idea of showing the partial flag on the top of the
screen, what if you are condensing more than ONE block. Then
if you cant remember which blocks are condensed. you wouldnt
be helped by knowing what the status of this one block was.
Maybe you should only be able to STOP1 and test out a lesson
from the block directory page. If you do STOP1 from inside
a block, then you should be brought to the directory page.

   A reduction in the system assumed lines to display

   When the change-over to new disk allocation scheme is
finally made, besides getting 7 block files (and 8; more
disk space in the process) a change to get 30 more words
from the 1st (directory) block will also occur. Then
we will have room to save additional code words and also
the associated micro and charset to use when editing.

        For several months the editor's Parts option from
the block index display hasn't worked quite right.
        Whereas (on a given terminal) the condense-flag
marks may plot correctly on the basic block index display,
the P option's '-' plotter is quite quirky, often being
completely unable to indicate show that a block is partsed
out.

       This occurrence is partly dependant on particular
terminals; but not completely, since in other than Parts-

   Please give us a repeatable procedure whereby such

it immediately. I don't think anyone else has ever
mentioned such a problem.  There seems to be some
possibility from the way you describe this that it
could be a hardware failure of the terminal; further

behavior to be terminal specific--would help.

I have frequently seen this  "-" problem happen, but

failure. My suggestion is: leave the block page (for
instance, enter block "a") and then return to the block
page.  That almost always fixes the "-"s.

     I seem to remember someone complaining about this
before, and the problem had nothing whatsoever to do
with the editor!
     It seems that the terminal dots where the flags
would show were weak from always getting those dots
lit up in the editor (I suppose the person in question
did a lot of editing), and the dots would sometimes
never light!
     Might this be the problem?

        Well, as I indicated, this only occurs when the
terminal is 'weak;' but the normal block-page plotting
routine always plots the minuses correctly, whereas the
Parts plotter often does nothing visible.
        Obviously, (1) you have to be at a terminal with
weak dots at the crucial locations to get the problem,
in which case it will always occur at the blocks at which
it occurs;  and (2) the block page is doing something
right that the P option doesn't do.

O'Brien's point is well-taken, and no doubt accounts for
the Federal-case momentum this exchange has taken on.
However, I cannot account for the intimations that are being
made that it is CHARACTERISTIC of systems to neglect to
make necessary announcements and to generally behave with
such a disdain of users that some form of drastic action is
called for in correction.
        To review this particular incident, GN125 was writ-
ten by one G. Hody, asking for an alteration to the editor
that would possibly speed it up a little. Blomme replied,
indicating why the suggested change could not be done now,
but promising a quite similar change. Overnight, the promise
was made good, and other changes were apparently also made
to speed up the system. Should these changes really have
waited a full day so people could read an announcement saying
Things will be better tomorrow...?

to press the space bar after _5_ lines... teach
was set to tell them about it...after _8_ lines--
now they never see that directive!

Before somebody takes offense at the phrase, "Anyway, this

through Notes.
        In this batch of general notes, I find 33
notes, of which 20 are requests for systems to do something,
two others are announcements by systems of things done, and
the rest are everything else.
        Most of the requests are minor ones that are fairly
classified as "low priority". Any one of them might, of
course, be easily and quickly done. But the continuing
stream must require most to be "tabled". Else the systems
folks would get nothing else done.
        By the way, the system seems to be running much

some changes to a later time: there are a large number
of users who are annoyed and confused (see note 142)by
the constant and quick changes to the system. We need
to be able to update the users as quickly as we update
the system of there are many negative results to what
would have otherwise been an improvement to the system.

It should be noted, however, that with any

to respect the values of others.

The owner of this signon, glenn stark, was working on
his charset in lesson biom2. Then, as often happens to
the best of us, he succumbed to the IRRESISTABLE urge to
go play some games! (sorry, massuh, wash my mouth with
soap) Anywho... when he came back from his game of
wingwar he went back to editing his charset. It seems
that his charclear flag was not reset by his gaming
efforts, since his charset contained wingwar chars!
(Only in spaces where he had chars) We had just been
demonstrating monitor mode; could this have anything to
do with it???

    Well, since there exists the -inhibit charclear-
command, it is not unlikely that this is the culprit.
However, it does happen on occasion that the charset id
does not get set properly, so plato thinks you have one
charset, while you really have another.
     The simple solution is to load a third charset,
which will hopefully set the id correctly, then go back
and load your proper one.

  There is an inhibit charclear accessable from that lesson,
but you must do a -term- + to get to it(a thing that is
not widely known), but I don't think that this would do
the trick. The inhibit charclear would have to be in the
charset editor(which of course it is not). I have had this
occasionally happen to me, but I've always passed it off
as a fluke, and just loaded a third charset.

          I do believe that monitoring someone loading
a charset is what does it! The charset is loaded
correctly at your terminal, but the charset flag is
not set.

     Hmmmmmm, I just tried monitoring another person and
tried every way that I could think of to duplicate the
order of the incident that frisco describes. Everything I
did worked perfectly. If it was the monitor mode that
affected things then it must have a weird quirk, such as
getting paged at the exact right instant to interfere with
the charset flag being set. At any rate I couldn't
duplicate it. Looks like we'll just have to take this in
stride, as we do with the frequent line errors at remote
sites.

is a true case of what I consider abusing ones powers.
  One person found that their sign-on had been deleted
without warning and worse yet...the couse director had
changed the password and read the p-notes before deleting
it! As a result of this it seems that somebody might
get in trouble for confiding in a friend in supposedly
PRIVATE notes. That is the big question..do course

I brought this up in an earlier (before notes was "cleaned")
note and we had many repsonses to other ideas in that note
on other subjects no one brought much attention to this
particular idea. Courses are under the direct management
of their course directors which does give them access (thru
illegal means (by changing the persons password)) to the
persons signon. Though the idea of zeroing the security code
of a person when the password is changed ( from course
records ONLY) was discussed, and even if this was changed,
this woul not solve the problem of a course director
"borrowing" a persons signon and parusing their pnotes.

   Unfortunately,(yes, Red Sweater this one IS in Websters)
I see no easy way of guarding against something like this
unless you have someone type in a "pnote security code"
which personally I would be against.

        This episode is disturbing, but I can't think of
any way to avoid it either. The only thing I can suggest
is that course directors be made more aware that there are
_personal_ things in personal notes, and that their responsi-
bilities as course directors gives them to right to this
material.

        One of the greatest oriticism of computer technology
today is that they threaten out privacy. Let's not become

In theory, a course director should be someone you can
trust implicity. In my experience, there have been
only two exceptions to the rule:
        1)People who have stolen the code to the course.
        2)College or high-school age types who are enjoy-

        This is truly the problem of any good dictatorship.
That is what the little peons below you think of you (even
if it isn't anything there is always the fear they maybe
plotting your downfall!). Seriously this isn't a problem at
all since there is an effective method of communication
which MAY still even be private otherwise known as the
U.S. Postal service.
        In other words,and let's face the truth, the purpose
of pnotes is not to inform your friend in Ill. of your most
recent sexual conquest. But, rather to discuss personal
problems you have with your lesson with someone your trust
or may be collaborating with. Therefore, what is in
pnotes should not be personal material but rather material
which deals with your lesson which might not be of
sufficient interest to put in general notes.

Disagree, Ken.  The purpose of PNOTES may have once been
as you describe, but its astonishing success is due to the
fact that computers are beginning to allow an information
revolution to take place. Putting aside "personal"
information, private administrative communication has
been vastly speeded up on PLATO. What once took $2.54
and three days to get written, typed, mailed and received
can now be ACTED upon in a matter of hours or minutes.
Ask any of the large project directors to comment upon their
improved efficiency and capacity to handle a mountain of
administrivia with a minimum of effort due to PNOTES.

In most cases I would think that reading someone's pnotes
deliberately in this way should be sufficient cause to
throw the person off the system.

Other than imposing this penalty, perhaps we could do this:
if the password is changed by editing the course,
make the pnotes unreadable until reactivated by a PLATO
system person.

        Bruce, you have the right idea. This is an unfor-

commensurate penalty. Your suggestion about reactivation
of pnotes files will probably go a long way to solving the
problem without resorting to that drastic penalty.

        Just a thought: How about making the reading of
one's pnotes contingent on the particular password in
effect when the last pnote was delivered. I.e., if a
course director changes someone's password, then trying
to read his pnotes results in a message "wrong password!"
That person can regain access to his pnotes by changing
his password back to the one he was using.

There is only one fault I can find with Bruce's method
of securing pnotes. What if the person is shrewd enough
to call a systems person and tell him that someone had
gone into course records and changed his password. Then
the systems person could (and probably would) help the
person out and change the flag indicating readability
back to its normal state. I do however like the idea
brought up by cohen wherein this relys on something
already passed which the course director has no control
over.

Everybody's upset on the assumption (stated in the basic
note) that the course director READ the deleted person's
notes before deleting his signon. I wonder how widely
known is the option that a course director has to
destroy all pnotes attached to a given signon (only if
the signon has already been deleted). Speaking only for
myself, I can't imagine reading someone's pnotes just to
help1-delete them one by one, when I could do them all with
a very few keypresses. Unless the course director was just
plain nosy; do you know that he really did read them, or did
you just assume that?

I think everyone is being a little paranoid here. Most
course directors are very responsible, and, strangely,
so are most of the people who accidentally or on pur-
pose discover a security code to a course. The exceptions
are usually kids who are new to the system and have some
perverse urge to make life miserable for their fellows.
Fortunately, such types usually do not have the expertise
to head up a project or steal a security code. I swear
if this note continues someone's gonna suggest we use
voice-prints or fingerprints to view personal notes...

---------- response 15

   Our intention is (and has been for some time) that
all the "loopholes" by which a course director could
gain access to anyone's personal notes be closed. There
are a couple of devious ways whereby a course director
can currently read someone's personal notes--we view
this as clearly wrong and definitely plan to make the
various checks and changes to stop this from happening.
Finding the right way to handle all the situations may
require some time yet, unfortunately. A course director
has the right to create and destroy records but should
not have the right to view personal correspondence. In
the not too distant future, the deletion of a record will
also automatically delete any personal notes associated
with that record; this will be both a convenience for
the course director and "security" for the user.

   one problem: Rick, in a case which I mentioned
in the note following this one, I had a person who just
transferred courses. I wanted to clear the space, but
first went in his signon to resend his notes to his
new signon, plus a note explaining exactly what I did
and why. Before any drastic changes are made, there
should be a way of resending his notes to his new
signon, if he has one. The guy told me later that
it didn't occur to him to send his notes to his new
signon, but needed the info contained in it. Therefore,
he was glad that I sent them. If there is another way
to resend notes, great! (as there may be more transfers
out of my course) But I consider what I did responsible.

   Sorry, I do not agree that anyone should have access
to personal notes other than the person to whom they
are addressed.
  The individual HIM/HER SELF can sign in to transfer
notes. The course director has a perfect right to go
ahead and delete someone if space is essential of course.
It seems a bit strange to store information needed on
a long term basis in personal notes (especially with
the note save option available now), so my sympathy for
someone who lost "essential information" in the deletion
of his personal notes is somewhat limited.
   It may be that we can also provide a "moving" service
that transfers not only a record but the personal notes
that belong to it as well--that seems a perfectly rational
sort of choice or option to have available.

   Great! If I had had that option, I certainly would
NOT have read the notes, but just transferred them, and
say good-bye. Another necessary option, as been mentioned
before, is the possibility of cleaning out note-files
for cooperation even if records do exist (granted, am
for the necessary messages that have all been brought up).

       I would hope that for people who 'move' that they
not only transfer and delete all their notes, but they
also use the new "turn-off" feature of personal notes to
leave a message saying where they can by contacted in the
future. All it takes is a little planning ahead.
        Judy, people who forget their their passwords
should have to deal with systems persons (i.e. maureen or
bill) to get them back. It will mean a little more of a
hassle than going to your course director, but I think that
is the price one pays for security.

 I appreciate the philosophical and ethical issues involved
in this discussion and would like to add the following ob-
servations: a) I tend to agree w/blomme that the contents
of pnotes should be accessible only to the person for whom
they were originally intended; b) The fact remains that
whenever electronic modes of communication are utilized
someone, somewhere _will_ have access to the communication,
regardless of whether the access is legal, moral, or
ethical. The rule is: when in doubt, be paranoid! I ask
some of the 'oldtimers' to harken back to a not too distant
past time when it seems DOD (or related agency) came down
hard on a discussion being carried out on Plato which the
DOD people misinterpreted as a call for 'political mobile-
ization'. There will alway be a big brother somewhere.

        in relation to the privacy issue
when course notes gets full , the course director can
delete notes, I don't like the idea of deleting notes
without reading them , and i like the idea of reading them
even less.

on the occasions when i have done this, mostly what i look
for is the date of the note -- the rule being that anything
ancient can go.

rather than change the password and sign the records in to
read the notes, a little information for the course
director would be helpful in judging what should be deleted
The date of the last note , or whether there are any
'new notes' would both be very useful.

this would aid in making decisions without reading other
peoples mail. ( recycle your notes space , folks!)

Occassionally, some of our authors have changed sign-ons.
Before I got around to deleting their old sign-on, they
received some p-notes. Since some of the authors used
plato infrequently and were difficult to reach by phone,
I signed in under their sign-on and transferred their
notes WITHOUT reading the notes. I, nonetheless, was not
happy about this method. I would prefer a way of
transferring p-notes without being able to see the note.

   and I agree with kaufman, as I have also had to
transfer notes to people no longer in course, but in
another course. However, I will bring this up: It
happened some time ago, but I wrote a help-note
and titled it "screwnote", because there was something
about notes that had a bug (absolutely NO other connotation
was even thought of, much less intended). (may have been
a gen-note, forget now) of some sorts. well, the next
day, I found my password blanked and went into my records
to read a note saying that in effect HE had interpreted (sp)
the title wrong, and since there was no other responses to
it, deleted my honest, although possibly dumb question.
(this was under syfrig/iu) (he wasn't even the course-

asking a 'dumb' question like that anyway.

you had seen that 'recycle your notes space' message about
a hundred times .

if you force me to keep our notes file 'clean', then you
had better give me some tools to do the job with.

and i still say
let us pay for the space and take that damn message away!

In response to the last reply, I really dont think that
taking it out on one systems person (the one who answered
in this note with a systems response) is the proper way
to take any positive action about this. As for the
"note recycled" message, I would advise you to send notes
to the authors in your course (especially the ones who
seem to collect many notes- I'm sure _all_ those notes cant
be SO important that deleting one or two of them every once
in a while could be dreadfully harmful. As for your
complaint about the systems people forcing you the tools to
do what you "have to", I dont see where your are "forced" to
do anything. It's nide to be able to keep notes but if the
course doesnt work together cooperatively then it is NOT

(cont)
NOT the systems peoples fault. It is the fault of the
people in the course. As for "paying" for space, I dont
see how you could "pay" for that space, since unless you
have the unlisted number to the systems peoples favorite
pizza place or the number to the Keebler cookie factory
(elf hot line) I dont see where paying for space would be
feasible.

        And then worst of all you pick a systems person
who has not had much(correct me if I amd wrong mr golden)
to do with the actual writing of lesson NOTES. Please
direct all complaints in the future to either Dave Woolley
(woolley of p) or Kim Mast (k mast of p).

Hoping your notes space isn't filled,

 First, I agree with fuller. Anyone caught reading anyone
elses notes should be kicked of the system. In reference to
the transfer of pnotes, what will stop a course director
from transfering the notes to his own signon or one he
created for the purpose??

        I'm confused. Exactley what is the justification
for reading someone else's notes? Is it that a notesfile
is almost full and you want to delete notes for one of
the worst offenders? I don't consider that an excuse, but
it is a problem for which other, more private solutions
(could) exist.
        Perhaps the option to allow a course director to
delete others notes should work whether or not the person's
records stille exist. The following things should probably
be changed at the same time:
1) The person who got his notes deleted (it his records
still exist) should get a message saying his notes were
deleted and by whom.
2) All the notes that were deleted should be sent back to
the original sender...with an appropriate message attached.

Would that solve your problem LB/ Now then, what other
reasons do people have for reading other peoples notes?

---------- response 11
  04/09     16.36     black       cdcc

Actually, I think the whole discussion started with the
problem of someone reading someone else's notes for no
reason. Something like being able to delete notes while
the sign-on still exists, particularly if coupled with
the date of the most recent note, or some such, would, as
far I can gather from the discussion, take care of the
majority of the problems.

However, that doesn't solve the problem of course directors
reading others personal notes with _no_ justification.

As far as I can determine, the only person who can look
at YOUR pnotes is YOU unless you show them to someone who
is standing next to you or watching your screen via the
monitor ability in the talk options. So what good would it
do to put a "last edited by" feature in it for? YOU would
always be the last editor and therefore render the whole

hmmm...... I just went in to lesson site, and after
typing the site number, then the password, I was asked to
type the site number again. Thinking I had hit a wrong key
first time, I did it, and it took me right into the lesson
without asking for the password. Is this supposed to happen
or is it a bug?  It does not seem to be repeatable, but it

I think your idea is right. You typed the wrong site

so you were asked for the site number again. This time
the sec code you just had typed did match and you
could go in,  (does that make sense? - it is repeatable).

No you wouldnt. When you type the password for a site in
it is the same as typing in your lesson security code.
(Matter of fact, that's exactly what you are doing..)
Therefore if you typed in the wrong site, you would have
typed in the correct security code for YOUR site but it
 would have not matched the site code(necessarily) to the
one you accidently typed the first time. Then when you tried
the second time it would have taken it as it would have if
you would have typed it from the author mode page (try it).

Some of the abilities of lesson -site- are to be able to
limit who has access to the site, being able to back someone
off that particular site(or everyone) and to send them a
message. And although it is nice to see what lesson everyone
is in, these other abilities, if put in the hands of a
careless user could cause havoc (or some other form of
overall grief)...

For those of us who use the system router, it sure would
be nice if:
a)        The inspect code were sufficient to view the
          instructor file catalog and router index. As it
          is now, only the security code works..and this
          seems inconsistent.
b)        there were some way to determine what lessons are
          actually chosen for the router index. As it is
          now, there is no way to tell exactly which lessons
        are used if the instructor sets up an index and
        rewrites the descriptions which appear on the index
        page. Could and option be provided perhaps in the
        leslist editor of the instructor file to list
        such lessons?
We who allow our instructors the freedom of maintaining
the course rosters and indexes...would be most appreciative.

Two weeks from today, a -use- code will be placed on
lesson "library".

PSO is planning some changes to "library" that we hope
will make it more convenient. One consequence of the
changes is that the block names may change frequently;
and -use- commands referring to "library" could suddenly
become unreliable.

If you are -use-ing "library", you should _S_ave the code
and insert it an your own lesson.

When using the system router and specifying an individual

student to start in....could the routine than ask me if
want the student to finish whatever lesson he may be in
currently (if a restart is in effect)...As it is now, if
I don't remember to clear the restart from records, the
student must finish the lesson he is currently in...I would
think that the usual case would be to want that restart
cleared since I am specifying a particular lesson in which
I want the student to start.
student must finis
        One peculiarity, however, is the fact that IF
the curriculum specifies lessons A,B and C....and the
student finishes some other lesson before starting on his
curriculum...he doesn't then go to A...to start as chosen
by the instructor...but to lesson B...Is this consistent?

    The Course Management System was designed to integrate

books, computers and live teachers in an effective manner

for courses with large numbers of students and instructors.

The logistic problems associated with multifaceted instruc-

tional programs were solved, in part, by using PLATO -- a

computer assisted instruction system centered at the Univer-

sity of Illinois. Students in the computer managed course

acquire basic information and concepts from individual read-
ing. Their attention to the material ........

...... is maintained and their progress monitored by a pre-

viously developed study management system. Lectures and

standard quiz sections are little used. The time of in-

structors is invested in remediation for students having

trouble mastering the core curriculum and in teaching semi-

nars. The role of the computer is to manage study behavior,

administer on-line achievement tests, and schedule group

tutorial and seminar sessions. The system has been tried

out in an introductory college economics course with an

enrollment of 360 students with generally favorable results.

pointed out at the time that keeping it up to date is

users see; J. Zais ¬+ J.G. Peters, recently of the same dept,
did the original programming. At the request of S. Andes,
Mr. Peters provided us with a copy of the PLATO III text
and code last fall. Since then, Mr. Andes and I have put
the lesson back together in our spare moments, with some
minor revisions of the code to enhance the view in the
lesson. Thx for the most gratifying remarks... I will

I read the bulletin board occasionally...usually I discover
references to something that I think is new; if I haven't
received information about it in notes (which I read every
day), I go looking in bulletin board. Incidentally,I love
all of the wonderful communications and other features of
PLATO, but I worry that as we add more , will we get to
the point where the system is so complicated that fewer and
fewer people will be able to master it for the proposes
of writing good educational materials. It seems to me there
has to be some sort of balance between the requests of
people whose needs are based on editorial convenience
features and practical educational needs.

We had a keyboard with a runaway "r", that was caused by
a defect in the keyboard. Just taking a guess, it would
seem that there is some logic circuit getting stuck in
you keyboard or terminal.
    But, if it's happening to more than one terminal it
could be in your modem.

It would be nice to have:

a) The touch panel disabled on the execution error page

This would be nice because the touch which gets the error
can often be followed by another touch which NEXT's past
the error display page.

b) A warning when a define set is almost too much

It's hard to tell when a define set is nearing the
"too much" limit; I just added a simple define to a
-use-d block and put a file I was not working on over the
limit. If I had been warned the last time I condensed that

the used defines.

A day ago or so there was considerable debate about the
possibility of course directors reading personal notes.

From that exchange of notes and from conversations here at
CERL, I conclude that there is general agreement that
personal notes aught to be private and that CERL aught to
take action against anyone who invades that privacy.

That does make for some difficulties for course directors.
As course director I went through a long period of begging
authors to delete notes...still the notes file was full most
days. I then reduced the number of notes each author could
receive. All is well now. I also destroy personal notes
of authors who have not been active for a long time and
are not likely to return. I do not read them first.

Along the privacy line, it would be nice if we could insert
lines from the save buffer into note space just as we can
the other way. In personal notes this would allow people
to hash their notes before sending them. In help notes
this would allow displaying the code that is giving the
author the problems. I realize that this is no solution
to the problem of course directors reading personal notes,
but it would be a nice addition.

Today, a student signed on and received a message
'Now preparing lesson please wait'....
 He left after 10 minutes, and five minutes later we still
could not back him off... An attempt to condense a
lesson showed that there was a condense queue of
about 46 people.. He was apparently number 46..

  We could not back him off from anywhere. STOP1 at his
terminal did not do it, and neither could he be backed
off from course records or by using the site director
options.
        This inability to use STOP1 to back a student
off has been reported before but no one from a systems
level has ever replied.
        I think it would be a good idea to enable STOP1
to send the student back to the system router index pages..
        I also think it would be nice if this note were
not ignored, and some reasonable answer given..

it is now 32 minutes later... I had to go into
course records, and figure out what lesson he was trying
to condense...  I then condensed the same lesson, and
being only 1 of 32 people in the queue, got the lesson
in 15-20 seconds..  Once I received the lesson, he also
got the same lesson, and could be shift-stopped...

     This does not solve the problem, and the complaint
as written previously still stands.

not have to be resorted to (or thought of)...

It is important to note that what counts is does the
system work in the classroom when the students try
to sign on. In fact, in many classrooms this past

of microwave problems. In chemistry, this has been

It should be pointed out that although an important

as it has in the past, the engineers worked very hard
to try to keep the entire -hardware-software-communication-

repair people in the chemistry classroom. It certainly
helped to have the hardware and software stable.

errors, CPU loading, and bad lessons may be with us for
some time. Nevertheless, a reduction in system crashes
from a rate of 28: (of prime time hours interrupted) in
January to a rate of 1: so far in April is an achievement
of the first magnitude. If sustained, it represents a new
plateau in the development of PLATO IV. In my judgment, it
is an achievement worthy of recognition and a few compli-

Are your terminals 9-24 and 9-21? There were two students
in talkomatic this afternoon under the playdo sign-on.

One of them was in the top channel typing HAHAHAHAHA

he ate up all the CPU thereby preventing us from talking.
Since we had something important to discuss, we were
quite thankful for your careful monitoring of playdo.

If someone will modify the system router so that we

But I still don't intend to open up game playing during
non prime time because that is when there is no one

Everyone seems to be very nasty about this whole thing but

communication between people doing business. I was also in
the channel where this person was typing haha's across the

before we had a chance to screen him out with a protect. I
suggest you check into the use of talko with your playdo

Steve,
You stated that you are afraid that one of your students
will throw "a fist through a panel" if your students
play games. From my acquaintence with pharmacy students
here, they are not quite so destructive. Furthermore, I
doubt whether you are monitoring your students so carefully
during primetime to prevent such damage. If you were,
I am sure you would have caught the person who was
causing us so much problems in talkomatic.

You have been on the system long enough to know that
multiples routed to games spread like wildfire over the
system. Yes, it is true that site directors can course
restrict their terminals. But it is a reall drag to have to
be constantly on the look for the next "dangerous" sign-ons.
Or conversely, to add new courses to the site list every
time a site creates a new course.

Now let me do a risky thing -- I will try to second

the system staff to make changes in the system. For
as you state:"If someone will modify the system router...
(like I suggested about 6 month ago)...I would be glad
to cooperate with Mr. Kauffman(sic)." Well, I too wish
someone would modify the system router as your suggested,
but until THEY do, you can write your own restrictions or
use one of the several routers other people have written.
For the restrictions that you cannot presently implement
(i.e. cpu load), you could ask for another system reserve
word. (For cpu load, tho, you could use the system
reserve word of the number of users on the system.)

You also seem to be pushing for an improvement with the
CPU. For the "loopholes in the systems time slicing
machinery"...you suggest we "see the authors or the

do you have to let us all suffer? I am not opposed to
such methods to get what are quite probably reasonable
requests, which have been reasonably suggested, and which
have been patiently waited for. And maybe we should all
join in the pain you will cause us to make a stronger
protest. But do we have to?

By the way, I am trying hard to reform my ways and

I hope we are still on good enough terms that you would

It seems to me that the whole problem here is now getting

 I would think that the responsibility for the use of
a multiple SHOULD rest with the person who sets it up,
and, if they see that it is being misused (abused in this

        Very interesting. Deiss has done much - maligned
the authors of a very fine communications program because
someone, responsible to him, was extremely discourteous
to the other people using the program, obviously mis-using
it. Now then, we can see that somehow, just because this
is a computer system and not "real life", all the courtesies
that we use otherwise somehow mysteriously dis-appear!
He says "go talk to the systems people" when asked to curb
the manners of these people. Makes life easier for you,
doesn't it? But what about all the other people, who are
cursing out loud because of this? How much time and effort
is it going to take you to things so that only people who
WANT your signons to run can... certainly, not as many as
those who do not. In any case, the initiative should be
yours, and not theirs. If it is theirs, then it is in

   Major surgery on the editor and/or the system is
going to be required in order to bring the functioning
of the editor back up to more acceptable levels. The
system staff will be involved in the work to accomplish
this, now that a reasonable key echo time has been
restored under load conditions of over 400 terminals.
   Because the amount of CPU processing time available
under heavy load is limited and because the editor is
a middle to heavy user of time, the performance of the
editor was affected by the system changes required to
service larger numbers of terminals.
   The change to number of lines displayed was just a
quick change that we hoped could have at least a minor
positive benefit in reducing CPU usage by the editor
while we study the various possible routes for the major

There are three serious difficulties with restricting
courses rather than sites.
        (1) The site director is at the mercy of the
            course directors, but the site director has the
            most to lose. We would need both course and
            site restrictions.
        (2) Courses are volatile things. New ones are
            created and destroyed each day. Keeping the
            restrictions up to date will require consider-
            able effort. The "other" category in site
            restrictions mitigates this somewhat.
        (3) There are a great many courses. The space
            needed to store the restrictions would be much
            greater than that used in restricting sites.
            If time dependent rules were stored, it would
            be even more space consuming.

I remember when there was an option in course records
that was supposed to let you choose the hours that the
course was on/off..  It worked to the point that it gave a
message that this course could not run at this time, but
it let you on anyway.

        Something like this is going to be needed again
someday in the future, and i see a system where it would let
you choose the hours of every day in the week, and also
decide whether authors, students, multiples, or instructors
could/could not run at those times.  It would take quite
a few variables to implement it this way, but might be
feasible if/when there ever no disk space shortage..

NETWORKS; I have read a previous note about keeping the
network program updated and I do understand the problem in-
volved in keeping such a program up to date.
        However, I would like to make a further suggestion:
those of us who are conducting inter-site discussions and
"symposia" on a particular topic or field would find it
extremely useful if the signons of the site directors were
also listed in network.  In this manner we would be able to
send personal notes of inquiry. etc.
        Is this possible?

This would eliminate the need to have a separate lesson

We do intend to make it possible for an instructor
to choose lessons directly from the index he sets up
(or from the catalog), instead of having to use a separate
student signon just to try the lessons.
The benefits of the router itself, however, are only
available to routed students. One way to give others
access to lessons in your curriculum is to set up a
multiple signon which takes the user to the router index.
(Several groups have multiples of this sort.)

In this note/response series I will attempt to reply to
some of the attacks that have come my way with regard to
general note 363.

Why stud/playdo?
The stud/playdo signon was created in order to facilitate
the delivery of demonstrations here at Purdue. At no
expense to and with little thanks from CERL I have given
hundreds of demonstrations over here. These demos have
been given for groups ranging from 1 to over 30 at once
with 4 to 8 terminals. A second reason is that through this
signon I am able to maintain order and control over game
playing so that it only takes place when the system can
support it. To my knowlege the game index on page 3 of the
playdo router does not have any loopholes in it and no one
can indiscriminantly run games via that signon. They can
get to games through sample and other items indexed, but
they can also get to a lot of very useful material thereby
also.....

---------- response 1
  04/13     15.38     deiss       phar

I would assume that the games they can run through sample
etc. have an educational justification for being listed
there. So I have not been worried by their presence.
Takomatic and healthnote is also listed in that index, and
to my knowledge no one over here has abused that priviledge.
Someone complained about misuse at sites 27 and 9, but
those sites are not mine. This is unfortunate and proper
steps will be taken. The stud/playdo signon has served us
very well here, and I have sought to share it with other
sites who expressed a need for something of this type.
This has lead to problems......

---------- response 2
  04/13     15.45     deiss       phar

Why it has become a problem:
Recently someone inquired in general notes (¬$14) about the
possibility of getting a general system wide and system
controlled game playing signon. Since stud/playdo has
been used successfully here for that purpose for several
months, I volunteered the information in hopes that it might
provide a model for those seeking this type of facility.
Unfortunately, someone who read that note has spread the
word indiscriminantly creating havoc for other site
directors. Only some malicious and/or irresponsible author
could have passed this on to game players since only
authors can read general notes anyway. I take full respon-
sibility for making it known in general notes, but not for
the caliber of people who have access to general notes
and who misuse such information.

The Inequity of it All:

There is a strange imbalance of power associated with this
system. Authors are allowed to kill cpu time by the hour
writing, condensing, and running games as a "deserved
diversion" while students cannot get into lesson sample
to study useful material very easily. Oddly enough, it is
the students who get labeled as "people of questionable
purpose and intent" when the authors do not even have to
justify the existence of their own lesson material. Authors
can spend hours shooting the breeze via term talk and
personal notes while students often do not have the facility
to report program bugs or otherwise comment upon the
material they are required to use via plato. This system
is too author oriented in that respect. There can be no
reason other than political for the absence of a student
note facility comparable to general and help notes. It is
cont....

---------- response 4

certainly feasible from a programming point of view. The
delay in this seems to me inexplicable. At the risk of
wearing out a cliche, it stikes me a total "cybercrud" that
authors can do this while students cannot. It reduces plato
to a game of computerized politics where what you are
allowed to do depends upon who you know more than anything
else. For these reasons I still feel that the stud/playdo
signon serves a useful purpose. I realize that it might
cause some sites temporary confusion, but for those sites
where such facilities are not desired, there is a simple
solution that has already been pointed out.
The solution:
Stud/playdo is not the only multiple on the system. Many
of you must be aware of others that allow access to chemis-
try or medical material. It is odd that I have been
attacked when the game index in course playdo is locked out
under all but special ......

circumstances. I think stud/playdo has as much right to
be on the system as these others, and the fact that its use
has spread so fast since first mention is indicative of the
demand for it from students. The reasons for the attacks
against myself are more personaly motivated I think - and
I'll come back to that point later. For those sites that
do not want stud on, it can easily be locked out with the
site director options. You do not have to repeat this for
every new multiple that comes along. You can lock your
site out once and for all to all such multiples under
category "other" in the site restrictions. The operator
for site 9 and the system person consulted (mentioned in
gnote 363) are clearly in error here.

The real motive behind this "crusade":

You will have to excuse me if I sound a little paranoid at
this point. In the last 30 days I have been accused of
complaining in notes about a cpu crunch (which I haven't),
I have been humiliated in front of others simply because I
have a degree in C.S., I have been told that I do not know
enough about the system to deserve the right to an opinion
about how it might be implemented in lesson adcis, I have
received several antagonistic personal notes, and now it
has been suggested that I be thrown off the system for
being irresponsible, I have been accused of hoarding parts
for our terminals, I have been accused of maligning the
authors of lesson talkomatic, I have been accused of
being responsible for some people at site 9 who abused
lesson talkomatic, I have seen one very brilliant and
inquisitve author silenced because...

he expressed some alternative views about how plato might
be implemented on other machines, I have watched people
curse and otherwise jump up and down in lesson adcis when
the same was suggested and so on. I am beginning to believe
that there are several influential people who will stop
at nothing to ensure that they have an exclusive voice in
how plato in eventually implemented. All of this seems to
have started about 1 month ago when I opened my mouth about
small computers in lesson adcis. Maybe I am just nuts, I
sure don't want to believe its true. But as Mr. Fuller and
others continue this !crusade! of character assasination
etc., my faith in the plato medium of communication will
dwindle fast.

So what am I going to do about stud/playdo?

Until someone shows me how students are getting to the
game index listed in the playdo router, nothing. If
students are running games through other items listed there,
I think there is either a good reason, or they should not be
listed there. The students who bothered Joe Kaufman (and
note that it _was_ an accidental mispelling back in 363) were
not from my site. If you find anyone doing that from my
site, just contact any author here. If such abuse does
continue at other sites, I will remove talkomatic from the
index for stud playdo. But the rest of it is there for
your use in demonstrating plato, if you do not want it, you
can lock it out.

         To clear the air...?
     Please! my aims were much more simplistic than people
are thinking they are. I just wanted to let the course
director know, out of courtesy, that his
(excellent) sequence was being abused. In the past, course
directors have always wanted to about these things...
I assumed that it was not intentional that the thing had
gotten spread, like wildfire (as has always happened) be-
cause of the well known (and rabidly active) grapevine.

        That's where my argument stops...

After reading this series of notes, I was tempted to
write an index to educational-type "fun" lessons.

First, though, I signed on as "stud" of "playdo".

Frankly, I don't think anybody could do a better job
of making a signon like that. It is comprehensive, but
not too large to grasp. The collection of lessons in
that router should be enough to convince anyone to
start using PLATO for his/her own education.

In short, I like it. Very much. Congrats on a fine, fine
index, Mr. Deiss.

       Comment facilities for students are certainly
planned, though not exactley the same as presently exists
for authors. It is hoped that someday students will have a
viable means of commenting on their lesson material and
reporting errors, but certainly that type of information
should go to the instructors and not to the system as a
whole. The reasons why it has not been implemented on the
system as yet are certainly NOT political, but rather
priority restricted.
        I see no reason why students should be able to
access the present note facilities designed for authors
(which in general, they would not be able to understand).

i think everyone is losing site of the original purpose
of the grants which made plato possible...

this purpose was to perform research and development
which would lead to an economical and versatile system
of delivery for computer-based education. communication,
competitive recreational games, and the entertainment
of authors and students alike - while nice when the system
is under low load-- aren't what it was made for and
aren't the items on which it will be evaluated.

as for steve's quote of my comment on "people of
questionable purpose"-- i include both authors and
students, i assure you...

as for the student multiples used by the medical group,
they are restricted strictly to site "med" or to other

distinctions between arguments on issues, and attacks

steve has undoubtedly been subjected to that sort of

by the way, i still believe access to multiples should be

there is an important issue subtly buried in the furor
over deiss's multiple signon... it is the fact that, on
plato, the priviledge of authoring is linked to the
unlimited access to files... this is obviously not
an inherent requirement of authoring and perhaps the
time has come to create the "junior author" category
which has been proposed before... that of an author
whose records would be associated with a limited list
of files, created by the course director. access would be
limited to the files in the list. this would be a "routed
author" category rather than a "junior" -- status would
not be the issue... rather access would be based on need.

one might even consider a class of students who would
be able to choose files by name, as instructors now
do... so there would be routed and unrouted authors
and students-- depending on their needs and responsibility.

---------- response 1
  04/14     12.13     eric       cornell

Howsomever, a routed author would not be able to view
other lessons to learn about good and bad techniques of
instruction on PLATO without all sorts of complicated
brouhaha by the "supervisor" of the routed author's
records.

And what demand would be fulfilled by an unrouted student
signon in the immediate future, other than easy access to
well-publicized lessons (many of which are games)? At this
time PLATO is not set up for easy browsing... I would thing
that a system-wide browsing signon (which would operate
within the limitations of system capabilities at any
instant) might be feasible when Published Lessons come into
existence.

   I can see the arguments that would result from such
a change. Such as where does one draw the line between
routed and unrouted authors. There would be people trying
to demote everybody and promote themselves. And in any
case, the decision would rest on the shoulders of the
course directors who create the records. Some would give
everybody unrouted records while others would restict
people as much as possible, depending on the type of
person he was.
  I am against any such change....and in any case I see
no real reason not to allow authors free access. I believe
that any such restiction would severly hamper any author
in learning tutor by example. If there were more lessons
about tutor on a more advanced level than we have presently
have it might be an acceptable possibility(even then, I'm

One other thing...

        What differentiates a "junior" author from a normal
average everyday (news reading) author? From what I can see
the only thing that the junior (routed if you wish) author
status does for one is to limit access to plato even more
than it is now.

        It almost seems a question not of ability to program
,but to be able to tell others what they can do and where
they s_hould _ be able to go. Somehow I had hoped that the

Junior author accounts won't work. The first think that
pathelogical 'junior' will do is create a leslist and a
jumpout index to all his favorite games. The checks involved
keep 'junior' down on the farm aren't worth it.
  If we (the upper middle class) with the help of 's' (the
supreme beings) limit 'junior' to editing and executing
1 lesson, I have a feeling that junior will do everything
in his power to crash the system and gum the works.

One means of preventing routed authors from re-routing
themselves is simply to have the condensor look at each
condense request to see if it is from a routed author--if
it is, then look for -jumpout-s and convert them to no-ops.
Whether the extra overhead from this is acceptable or not
is a judgment requiring data that s-people would have to
provide, but it seems clear that such an approach could be
made to work.
        It also seems clear to me that someone who is
hiring an author and paying him money might have legitimate
use for routed author signons, and I know that many
course directors would be more willing to give unpaid
authors a chance at the system if they didn't have to
worry about what such authors might do to the good name
of the courses involved.

It will not appear with an-inhibit erase-. Could that
be your problem? The message should appear whenever the

What is the relation between the amount of space for notes
in a coursefile and the number of notes an individual can
receive? I keep getting messages such as you have room
for 10 notes in your file your course has room for 13.
So I was wondering if I'm holding open the notefile or
if there are a number of people like me storing 2 or 3
notes each.

---------- response 1
  04/14     11.46     golden       s

There are separate limits on the number of notes the entire
course may receive and on the number each author may receive

The space available varies greatly, but on the average
there is enough space for 2 or 3 notes per author.

So, if you allow 6 or 10 notes to sit around for several
days you are depriving several of your colleagues of the
oportunity to get their fair share of notes.

I don't know why so many people see this differently,
but I find I can destroy nearly all notes I receive
immediately after the first reading.

?One reason for keeping notes is that the HELP section at
the end of your pnote file says that you can prevent
people from sending you notes if you delete all the notes in
your file. I have assumed that this means that if I were to
delete them all. no one would be able to send me any notes.
Since I want to be able to receive notes. I keep things
stored in my file. Should this perhaps be changed?

What the help section says (or at least means) is that you
_can_ turn off your notes receiving capability. Deleting your
notes has nothing to do with this. You have to press a few
extra keys in order to turn off your notes file. And if
you do you can also turn it back on whenever you please.

Turning off your notes does not directly and automatically
follow from deletion of all your notes. What the message
means is that in order to turn off your notes receiving
capability, you must first delete all your notes.

I think a resonable restriction on the games would not be

  Right, Jim. An excellent example would be Bowery's own
game, spasim. Many would say it is a typical "fly-around-
and-shoot-'em-up" game which deserves no status at all
since it has no educational content. I personally disagree,
since spasim was my first practical exposure to spherical
coordinates, and playing spasim has given me proficiency
in that coordinate system. There is NO WAY we can fairly
inhibit ANY games on this system (with very few exceptions)
because who can say what is educational and what is not?
Just let the matter die like it has umpteen times before.

---------- response 4
  04/14     13.05     hody       med

i question that the fact that spasim has helped some
learn polar coordinates is a necessary reason to class
it other than a game... as many have said many times
before, the idea is not to curb "game" approaches
to teaching, rather to curb use of plato which is
primarily recreational-- and only to curb that when
it interferes with people who have to work...

ps: that can happen outside of prime time too, when
plato is on half-ecs or reloading and recondensing
frequently... hence another request for identification
of low priority of resources-- to be attached to both
users and lessons... and to apply to anything in short
supply...

what's a high priority use? -D fulfilling contractual
obligations, preparing materials and running students
in organized courses... any objections to those priorities?

I don't buy the argument that it is not possible to tell
what is a game and what is not except for rare exceptions.
I agree that learning does take place in the games and
they do provide an introduction PLATO for many students
(including myself.) I feel that a policy such as is applied
here in which a large number of games are available during
off hours on a general sign on is very fair. People
who wish to 'learn' about spherical coordinates may do
so then. The social problem as I see it is that authors
have been given the privledge of using the computer
to entertain themselves whenever they wish something
the ordinary student cannot do. Creating a junior author
merely creates more of a caste system. ie. I was able to
get info on a dataset editor for my lesson. Imagine if
I had to get premission to add the dataset editor to my course.

 I think there is a simple problem here that no one has

game signon NOW but what will be the situation once that
comes into effect. As I see it to author during non-prime

     I have to disagree with the person who said you
can classify games and non-games. He said there were
a very few instances. I can whip off about 20 from the
top of my head which are controversial and have been
argued about a countless number of times. For example.
would you consider news a game or a " serious" lesson.
There's definitely arguments on both sides. Also,
site directors can now inhibit the games at whatever
times they desire if they want to, so it shouldn' have
to be done system-wide.

(Whether you agree with this definition or not is immaterial

I have some questions...
        To tracht of ced:
      About the "social problem" authors seem to have (this
is in accordance with response -$5 this note). I would as you
one question. Would you allow students the same access to
games as authors do, at ANY time as the authors have it as
it stands now? What would be the ratio of time spent in
instructional lesson versus time spent in a "game". I would
function of a student of PLATO? It certainly is not to
play games, But since the authors (this is considering that
all authors are working at some time on instructional
material) are programming the lessons which are to be used
by the students and are (I think) under more stress than
would a normal student, they should have some form of
temp. relaxation.

        And in response to the problem of game people who
are "stacked up" at the med center, I dont think that this
would bring cause to the adding of the junior author status
as much as it would a stricter eye from the site director.

        To fay of rtv362:
I dont see where Jim is clouding the issue at all. I should
ask you in a further response to relavently describe lesson
as a game or a worthwhile information relaying lesson and
reasons for that decision.

Gary Michael made an excellent suggestion yesterday about
the category system being worked on for the new version
of Notes...one which I hope Dave Woolley will implement...
namely that there be a category for arguments about games,
restricting games, restricting people from playing games,
how such restrictions violate the Bill of Rights, etc.
Then the people who want to can fight about these things
to their hearts' content and the rest of use can lock out
the category and forget about it.

Sorry about stopping in the middle of the last note.
I think a reasonable thing to do on the games would
not be to have a special classification of junior
authors, but rather to restrict the use of games
to non prime time for _everyone_. That would only
nessisitate deciding which lessons were games and having
them not condense during ptime (an easy task with the
ptime system word.) I can't help but wonder if all of
this talk about junior authors (and one resentment that
many of the students have is that authors can play games
during prime time at many sites.) is so that the senior
authors can continue their abuses. I can see no reason
why anyone===__=______ should be able to clog up the computer for
his won benifit while legitimate users are being autobreaked.

It is very difficult to classify something as a game or not.
What do you think of "how the west was won?" That is
definitely a game but I'm sure that many elementary math
students have learned a lot fron that lesson.

Restricting it until after ptime isn't feasible since
many of the kids who use it are rather young and may not
want to stay up all night just to do their math lessons.

---------- response 2

In response to the last note. I wish to further clarify my
definition of a game. My definition is a program that is
used for recreational use. If I am at a site where students
are learning basic math, How the West Was Won might be a
a worthwhile lesson. If I am a college student
 my use is probably at the game level.
I was mainly reffering to programs which are obvious games
such as moonwar. I see no reason why the lessons couldn't
be made to condense either for a specific course or only
during the off hours. Only lessons which have a record of
being abused would need to be classified as only condensable
by proper course or ptime. Although there are many games
on PLATO how many are used regularly enough to amount to
a significant amount of CPU time? Many of the games
I have seen are not enjoyable enough for me to play more
than once or twice.

The only problem with a hazy definition like that is that
you will eventually have to apply it to every lesson on the
system. Go into lesson -wordwar- or lesson -news- and tell
us whether they are games or not.

   P.E.E.R. people,

   Could you make public any statistics on the percentage
of the cpu and ECS taken up by what even MIGHT be refered
to as "game" type lessons during prime time?

   If this data has not been gathered I would suggest that
it be gathered since many people assume that the way to
minumize auto-break in their lessons is to restrict
recreational lessons during prime time. This will continue
to be a scape-goat for auto-break induced aggressions until
the statistics are made known from a reputable source.

  If indeed, these "games" use a major portion of the
available prime-time computer resources, they should be
delt with at an administrative level as soon as possible.

Be sure to include lesson "edit" as a game. I was once
thrown out of room 165 while editting a lesson because
(in the words of the instructor) "There is no game-playing
until after 10:00"...
        (I think lesson edit IS classified as a game, since
it is not used for instructional purposes. After all, what
has anyone learned from going through lesson edit? And how
many students in instructional courses use it?)

I must admit, when I first browsed through that lesson,

I won't belabour the point much further, but I do want to
