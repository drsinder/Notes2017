We're here to mark the end of this war, to honor the sacrifices of all
those who made this day possible, and to turn the page, begin a new chapter
in the history between our two countries -- a normal relationship between
sovereign nations, an equal partnership based on mutual interests and
mutual respect.

This is an asymmetric war.  In asymmetric wars, you want to pit your
greatest strength against the enemy's greatest weakness.  Our great
strengths are our ideals and our system of justice.
 
As it turns out, our enemies' greatest weakness is that they are bereft of
ideals.  If we can maintain our ideals, our sense of justice, in the face
of this, we can win.  What the enemy, what the terrorists want to do --
because they know they can't beat us militarily -- [is] they can try to
change us.  They can cause us to become more like them, and for them,
that's victory.

I grew up in Lebanon, and my two oldest brothers were on the cross country
team with Craig.  His accomplishments include:
 
* Wins in all 48 of the prep cross country meets he entered as a junior and
senior, setting records in 47 of them.
* Wins in 95 of 100 cross country races from his sophomore year in high
school to his senior year at Illinois.
* Nine Big Ten titles at Illinois -- 4 in cross country and 5 in track.
* Two cross country world championships.
 
His 1972 time of 13:50.6 in the Illinois State High School Cross Country
Championship still stands after 39 years.  He didn't run before 9th grade.

Today the poor are less often dismissed, I hope, from our consciences by
being branded as inferior or incompetent.  We also know that no matter how
dynamically the economy develops and expands, it does not eliminate all
poverty.                                   
 
The problem indicates that our emphasis must be twofold.  We must create
full employment or we must create incomes.  People must be made consumers
by one method or the other.  Once they are placed in this position we need
to be concerned that the potential of the individual is not wasted.

Holding: Attaching a GPS device to a vehicle and then using the device to
monitor the vehicle's movements constitutes a search under the Fourth
Amendment.
 
Judgment: Affirmed, in an opinion by Justice Scalia on January 23, 2012.
Justice Sotomayor filed a concurring opinion.  Justice Alito also filed a
concurring opinion, which was joined by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, and
Kagan.  The five concurring members of the Court do not resolve the
question of whether the search was reasonable in this case.

The right to travel enables the free exercise of the other rights we most
cherish.  We should not have to check our constitutional freedoms at the
curb simply because we decide to leave the house.  Sadly, freedom of
movement has been one of the most disparaged rights throughout human
history, and our country is no exception.  If we are ever to be truly free,
then we must possess an absolute, uninhibited right to travel throughout
America and the world free from interference by government.

trouble is that we have been appallingly bad gardeners.  We have not
bothered to acquaint ourselves with the simplest principles of gardening.
By neglecting our garden, we are storing up for ourselves, in the not very

doing it with all the bland complacency of an idiot child chopping up a

At the same time, our entire nation was in the throes of a massive economic

You say that I have been dished up to you as an antifederalist, and ask me
if it be just.  My opinion was never worthy enough of notice to merit
citing; but since you ask it I will tell it you.  I am not a Federalist,
because I never submitted the whole system of my opinions to the creed of
any party of men whatever in religion, in philosophy, in politics, or in
anything else where I was capable of thinking for myself.  Such an
addiction is the last degradation of a free and moral agent.  If I could
not go to heaven but with a party, I would not go there at all.  Therefore
I protest to you I am not of the party of federalists.  But I am much
farther from that than of the Antifederalists.

All power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  Great

authority: still more when you superadd the tendency or the certainty of
corruption by authority.  There is no worse heresy than that the office
sanctifies the holder of it.

All that Proposition 8 accomplished was to take away from same-sex couples
the right to be granted marriage licenses and thus legally to use the
designation of "marriage", which symbolizes state legitimization and
societal recognition of their committed relationships.  Proposition 8
serves no purpose, and has no effect, other than to lessen the status and
human dignity of gays and lesbians in California, and to officially
reclassify their relationships and families as inferior to those of
opposite-sex couples.

Beware the irrational, however seductive.  Shun the "transcendent" and all
who invite you to subordinate or annihilate yourself.  Distrust compassion;
prefer dignity for yourself and others.  Don't be afraid to be thought

be a spectator of unfairness or stupidity.  Seek out argument and
disputation for their own sake; the grave will supply plenty of time for
silence.

You cannot avoid making judgements but you can become more conscious of the
way in which you make them.  This is critically important because once we
judge someone or something we tend to stop thinking about them or it.
Which means, among other things, that we behave in response to our
judgements rather than to that to which is being judged.  People and things
are processes.  Judgements convert them into fixed states.  This is one
reason that judgements are often self-fulfilling.

Political rights do not exist because they have been legally set down on a
piece of paper, but only when they have become the ingrown habit of a
people, and when any attempt to impair them will meet with the violent
resistance of the populace.  Where this is not the case, there is no help
in any parliamentary Opposition or any Platonic appeals to the
Constitution.  One compels respect from others when he knows how to defend
his dignity as a human being. ...  The peoples owe all the political rights
and privileges which we enjoy today in greater or lesser measure, not to
the good will of their governments, but to their own strength.

Resolved [...] that it would be a dangerous delusion were a confidence in
the men of our choice to silence our fears for the safety of our rights:
that confidence is every where the parent of despotism; free government is
founded in jealousy, and not in confidence; it is jealousy, and not
confidence, which prescribes limited constitutions to bind down those whom
we are obliged to trust with power; that our Constitution has accordingly
fixed the limits to which, and no farther, our confidence may go; [...].

The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any
member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to
others.  His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient
warrant.  He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it
will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because,
in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise, or even right.  These
are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or
persuading him or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting
him with any evil, in case he do otherwise.

Some men look at constitutions with sanctimonious reverence and deem them
like the ark of the covenant, too sacred to be touched.  They ascribe to
the men of the preceding age a wisdom more than human and suppose what they
did to be beyond amendment.  I knew that age well; I belonged to it and
labored with it.  It deserved well of its country.  It was very like the
present but without the experience of the present; and ... years of
experience in government is worth a century of book-reading; and this they
would say themselves were they to rise from the dead.

will seek an initial public offering, and at an estimated $53 a share, you

Into this Garden of Eden each human being is born perfect.  We were all
born divine mutants, the DNA code's best answer to joyful survival on this
planet.  An exquisite package for adaptation based on 2 billion years of
consumer research (RNA) and product design (DNA).  Each baby, although born
perfect, immediately finds himself in a [sic] imperfect, artificial,
disharmonious social system that systematically robs him of his divinity.
 
Individual societies begin in harmonious adaptation to the environment and,
like individuals, quickly get trapped into nonadaptive, artificial,
repetitive sequences.  And the social systems?  Where did they come from?
 
When the individual's behavior and consciousness get hooked to a routine
sequence of external actions, he is a dead robot, and it is time for him to
die and be reborn.  It is time to drop out, turn on, and tune in.  This
period of robotization is called the Kali Yuga, the Age of Strife and
Empire, the peak of so called "civilization".

This relentless law of death, life.  Change is the rhythm of the galaxies
and the seasons, the rhythm of the seed.  It never stops.
 
If you've become a dead robot with your consciousness hooked into routines,
and *more* routines:
 
Drop Out - Detach yourself from the external social drama which is as
dehydrated and ersatz as TV.
 
Turn On - Find a sacrament which returns you to the temple of God -- your
own body.  Go out of your mind.  Get high.  
 
Tune In - Drop back in to express it.  Start a new sequence of behavior
that reflects your vision.  Be reborn.  Become your highest vision of you.
Death.  Life.  Structure.  The sequence must continue.  You cannot stand
still.

result of politicians and government appointees making decisions based on
their concerns about the security of their own careers if they don't act
tough on terror, and capitulating to public demands that "something must be
done." ...  This loss of trust -- in both airport security and
counterterrorism policies in general -- is the first harm. ...
 
In 2004, the average extra waiting time due to TSA procedures was 19.5
minutes per person.  That's a total economic loss -- in America -- of $10
billion per year, more than the TSA's entire budget.  The increased
automobile deaths due to people deciding to drive instead of fly is 500 per
year.  Both of these numbers are for America only, and by themselves
demonstrate that post-9/11 airport security has done more harm than good.

It might be crazy to believe that government policy will be something more
than the handmaiden of the most powerful interests.  It might be crazy to
argue that we should preserve a tradition that has been part of our
tradition for most of our history -- free culture.  If this is crazy, then
let there be more crazies.  Soon.

Here is the Golden Rule of sound citizenship, the first and greatest lesson
in the study of politics: you get the same order of criminality from any
State to which you give power to exercise it; and whatever power you give
the State to do things FOR you carries with it the equivalent power to do
things TO you.

But as long as it's doable I'm going to do it.  Because I know that guys
like Soros have been doing it for years, if not decades.  And they stay
below the radar by creating a network of corporations to funnel their
money.  I have my own philosophy and I'm not ashamed of it.  I gave the
money because there is no other legal way to do it.  I don't want to go
through ten different corporations to hide my name.  I'm proud of what I do
and I'm not looking to escape recognition.

In the midst of all my bitching, you might have noticed that I never
complain about politicians.  I leave that to others.  And there's no
shortage of volunteers; everyone complains about politicians.  Everyone
says they suck.  But where do people think these politicians come from?
They don't fall out of the sky; they don't pass through a membrane from a
separate reality.  They come from American homes, American families,
American schools, American churches, and American businesses.  And they're
elected by American voters.  This is what our system produces, folks.  This
is the best we can do.  Let's face it, we have very little to work with.
Garbage in, garbage out.
 
Ignorant citizens elect ignorant leaders, it's as simple as that.  And term
limits don't help.  All you do is get a new bunch of ignorant leaders.  So
maybe it's not the politicians who suck; maybe it's something else.  Like
the public.  That would be a nice realistic campaign slogan for somebody:
"The public sucks.  Elect me." Put the blame where it belongs: on the
people.

Our precedent demonstrates that Congress had the power to impose the
exaction in Section 5000A under the taxing power, and that Section 5000A
need not be read to do more than impose a tax.  This is sufficient to
sustain it.

Such dread was a large part of the post-9/11 decade.  A culture of fear had
created a culture of spending to control it, which, in turn, had led to a
belief that the government had to be able to stop every single plot before
it took place, regardless of whether it involved one network of twenty
terrorists or one single deranged person.  This expectation propelled more
spending and even more zero-defect expectations.  There were tens of
thousands of unsolved murders in the United States by 2010, but few
newspapers ever blared this across their front pages or even tried to
investigate how their police departments had to failed to solve them all
over the years.  But when it came to terrorism, newspaper and other media
outlets amplified each mistake, which amplified the threat, which amplified

Machines which ape people are tending to encroach on every aspect of
people's lives, and that such machines force people to behave like
machines.  The new electronic devices do indeed have the power to force
people to "communicate" with them and with each other on the terms of the
machine.  Whatever structurally does not fit the logic of machines is
effectively filtered from a culture dominated by their use.  The machine-
like behaviour of people chained to electronics constitutes a degradation
of their well-being and of their dignity which, for most people in the long
run, becomes intolerable.  Observations of the sickening effect of
programmed environments show that people in them become indolent, impotent,
narcissistic and apolitical.  The political process breaks down, because
people cease to be able to govern themselves; they demand to be managed.

It's hard to construct a scenario that is at all plausible in which
somebody fakes something like this.  The world is not really crawling with
crooked papyrologists.

So here's this video that someone posted a week ago (I recommend the
video).  It runs 7 minutes long.  And it was watched 3 million times during
the first week.  So that's 21 million minutes (35,000 hours (14,500+ days
(~40 years))) spent watching that video, in just the first week.  That's an
average of 2000+ people viewing this video at any given time throughout the
week.  That's +100,000 views since I first watched the video earlier today.
 
And according to the video, it took ~600 hours to produce the Rube Goldberg
device in the video.  So that's a viewing payback of almost 60:1 in just
the first week.

myself, but understood that I was obligated to tell the truth about
everything I knew.  So that is what I did.

reach across the aisle to do the people's work.  And we citizens also have
to rise to the occasion.
 
We look to our teachers and professors, we count on you not just to teach,
but to inspire our children with a passion for learning and discovery.  We
look to our pastors and priests and rabbis and counselors of all kinds to
testify of the enduring principles upon which our society is built:
honesty, charity, integrity and family.  We look to our parents, for in the
final analysis everything depends on the success of our homes.  We look to
job creators of all kinds.  We're counting on you to invest, to hire, to
step forward.  And we look to Democrats and Republicans in government at
all levels to put the people before the politics.
 
I believe in America.  I believe in the people of America.  And I ran for
office because I'm concerned about America.  This election is over, but our
principles endure.  I believe that the principles upon which this nation
was founded are the only sure guide to a resurgent economy and to renewed
greatness.

come from or what you look like or where you love.  It doesn't matter
whether you're black or white or Hispanic or Asian or Native American or

Seats in Congress, seats in the state legislature, that big seat in the

campaign resources, who have the largest bank accounts or own riches.
That, I submit to you, is no democracy.  It is an oligarchy of the already

I have always encouraged the creativity of an artist.  But one has to have
solid knowledge and know the rules to break it.  Improvisation does not
mean tampering with the authenticity of a classical raga.  I was probably
way beyond my time when I first started to experiment with western
instruments and western musicians.  Contrary to popular belief, I never
performed with the Beatles.  George Harrison came to me as he was so taken
by our music and became my student.  It was not a fad for him, he loved it
until the end and became very very dear to me.  John Coltrane was so
impressed by my music and had a few lessons from me, and again was so moved
that he named his son after me.

Democracy is an imperfect concept slowly seeking perfection.
 
However, I note that we Americans have been quite impatient with people of
other lands who have not embraced our democracy.  In some cases, we have
officially condemned these nations in very harsh terms, and, in some, we
have even used military force.
 
The question we Americans have debated over the decades is simple but
profound: "Should we impose our will upon other lands?  Or should we adopt
a more peaceful path in convincing others of the goodness of our system and
philosophy?" I suppose this matter will be debated for as long as we exist.

sufficiently fashionable to procure them general favour; a long habit of
not thinking a thing WRONG, gives it a superficial appearance of being

The tough mind is sharp and penetrating, breaking through the crust of
legends and myths and sifting the true from the false.  The tough-minded
individual is astute and discerning.  He has a strong austere quality that
makes for firmness of purpose and solidness of commitment.
 
Who doubts that this toughness is one of man's greatest needs?  Rarely do
we find men who willingly engage in hard, solid thinking.  There is an
almost universal quest for easy answers and half-baked solutions.  Nothing
pains some people more than having to think.

A host of positive psychological changes inevitably will result from
widespread economic security.  The dignity of the individual will flourish
when the decisions concerning his life are in his own hands, when he has
the means to seek self-improvement.  Personal conflicts among husbands,
wives and children will diminish when the unjust measurement of human worth
on the scale of dollars is eliminated.

State criminal abortion laws, like those involved here, that except from
criminality only a life-saving procedure on the mother's behalf without
regard to the stage of her pregnancy and other interests involved violate
the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which protects against
state action the right to privacy, including a woman's qualified right to
terminate her pregnancy.  Though the State cannot override that right, it
has legitimate interests in protecting both the pregnant woman's health and
the potentiality of human life, each of which interests grows and reaches a
"compelling" point at various stages of the woman's approach to term.

Here is a revolver.
It has an amazing language all its own.
It delivers unmistakable ultimatums.
It is the last word.
A simple, little human forefinger can tell a terrible story with it.
Hunger, fear, revenge, robbery, hide behind it.
It is the claw of the jungle made quick and powerful.
It is the club of the savage turned to magnificent precision.
It is more rapid than any judge or court of law.
It is less subtle and treacherous than any one lawyer or ten.
 
When it has spoken, the case can not be appealed to the supreme
    court, nor any mandamus nor any injunction nor any stay of
    execution come in and interfere with the original purpose.
And nothing in human philosophy persists more strangely than the
    old belief that God is always on the side of those who have the
    most revolvers.

the following circumstances: (1) where an informed, high-level official of
the US government has determined that the targeted individual poses an
imminent threat of violent attack against the United States; (2) where a
capture operation would be infeasible -- and where those conducting the
operation continue to monitor whether capture becomes feasible; and (3)
where such an operation would be conducted consistent with applicable law
of war principles.  In these circumstances, the "realities" of the conflict
and the weight of the government's interest in protecting its citizens from
an imminent attack are such that the Constitution would not require the
government to provide further process to such a US citizen before using
lethal force. ...
 
Finally, the Department notes that under the circumstances described in

Basically I'm an optimist.  Intellectually I can see man's balance is about
fifty-fifty, and his chances of blowing himself up are about one to one.  I
can't see this any way but intellectually.  I'm just emotionally unable to
believe that he will do this.  This means that I am by nature an optimist
and by intellectual conviction a pesimist, I suppose.

The United States military, as I've said, is not and, frankly, should not
be a 911 service capable of arriving on the scene within minutes to every
possible contingency around the world. The U.S. military has neither the
resources nor the responsibility to have a fire house next to every U.S.
facility in the world.

Each must act as he thinks best; and if he is wrong, so much the worse for
him.  We stand on a mountain pass in the midst of whirling snow and
blinding mist, through which we get glimpses now and then of paths which
may be deceptive.  If we stand still we shall be frozen to death.  If we
take the wrong road we shall be dashed to pieces.  We do not certainly know
whether there is any right one.  What must we do?  "Be strong and of a good
courage." Act for the best, hope for the best, and take what comes. ...  If
death ends all, we cannot meet death better.

In today's world, subject to so many rapid changes and shaken by questions
of deep relevance for the life of faith, in order to govern the bark of St.
Peter and proclaim the gospel, both strength of mind and body are

We did not see (as a result of brain scans of partisan loyalists) any
increased activation of the parts of the brain normally engaged during
reasoning.  What we saw instead was a network of emotion circuits lighting
up, including circuits hypothesized to be involved in regulating emotion,
and circuits known to be involved in resolving conflicts.  None of the
circuits involved in conscious reasoning were particularly engaged.
Essentially, it appears as if partisans twirl the cognitive kaleidoscope

reinforced for it, with the elimination of negative emotional states and
activation of positive ones. ...  The result is that partisan beliefs are
calcified, and the person can learn very little from new data.

Also, you claim that it is environmentally friendly to ride a bike.  But if
I am not mistaken, a cyclists [sic] has an increased heart rate and
respiration.  That means that the act of riding a bike results in greater
emissions of carbon dioxide from the rider.  Since CO2 is deemed to be a
greenhouse gas and a pollutant, bicyclists are actually polluting when they
ride.

The primary purpose of the DATA statement is to give names to constants;
instead of referring to pi as 3.141592653589793 at every appearance, the
variable PI can be given that value with a DATA statement and used instead
of the longer form of the constant.  This also simplifies modifying the
program, should the value of pi change.

to make a personal thought, a striking idea, an inner emotion perceptible
to other people's senses in such a way that there is no uncertainty about
the maker's intentions.

Character in many ways is everything in leadership.  It is made up of many
things, but I would say character is really integrity.  When you delegate
something to a subordinate, for example, it is absolutely your
responsibility, and he must understand this.  You as a leader must take
complete responsibility for what the subordinate does.  I once said, as a
sort of wisecrack, that leadership consists of nothing but taking
responsibility for everything that goes wrong and giving your subordinates
credit for everything that goes well.

The community as a whole doesn't listen patiently to critics who adopt
alternative viewpoints.  Although the great lesson of history is that
knowledge develops through the conflict of viewpoints.  If you simply have
a consensus, it generally stultifies.  It fails to see the problems of that
consensus and it depends on the existence of critics to break up that
iceberg and permit knowledge to develop.  This is in fact one of the
underpinnings of democratic theory.  It is one of the reasons why we
believe in notions of free speech and it's one of the great forces in terms
of intellectual development.

It's up to you whether or not you want to do work with no contract.  I
think artists do need to do work with no contract, because what we're
motivated by is not money.  We're motivated by a need to express ourselves
and to get our ideas out.  That's the motivation.  It turns out that when
people like it they frequently will support you if you give them a means,
but this is not a contract.

The basic drive behind real philosophy is curiosity about the world, not
interest in the writings of philosophers.  Each of us emerges from the
preconsciousness of babyhood and simply finds himself here, in it, in the
world.  That experience alone astonishes some people.  What is all this --
what is the world?  And what are we?  From the beginning of humanity some
have been under a compulsion to ask these questions, and have felt a

here at home.  Our service-members and their families have sacrificed far
more on our behalf.  Nearly 7,000 Americans have made the ultimate
sacrifice.  Many more have left a part of themselves on the battlefield, or
brought the shadows of battle back home.  From our use of drones to the
detention of terrorist suspects, the decisions we are making will define
the type of nation -- and world -- that we leave to our children.
 
So America is at a crossroads.  We must define the nature and scope of this
struggle, or else it will define us, mindful of James Madison's warning
that "No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual
warfare." Neither I, nor any President, can promise the total defeat of
terror.  We will never erase the evil that lies in the hearts of some human
beings, nor stamp out every danger to our open society.  What we can do --
what we must do -- is dismantle networks that pose a direct danger, and
make it less likely for new groups to gain a foothold, all while
maintaining the freedoms and ideals that we defend.

We must abandon the unworkable notion that it is morally reprehensible for
some countries to pursue weapons of mass destruction yet morally acceptable
for others to rely on them for security -- and indeed to continue to refine
their capacities and postulate plans for their use.      
 
Similarly, we must abandon the traditional approach of defining security in
terms of boundaries -- city walls, border patrols, racial and religious
groupings.  The global community has become irreversibly interdependent,
with the constant movement of people, ideas, goods and resources.  In such
a world, we must combat terrorism with an infectious security culture that
crosses borders -- an inclusive approach to security based on solidarity
and the value of human life.  In such a world, weapons of mass destruction
have no place.

DOMA's principal effect is to identify a subset of state-sanctioned
marriages and make them unequal.  The principal purpose is to impose
inequality, not for other reasons like governmental efficiency.
Responsibilities, as well as rights, enhance the dignity and integrity of
the person.  And DOMA contrives to deprive some couples married under the
laws of their State, but not other couples, of both rights and
responsibilities. ...
 
The federal statute is invalid, for no legitimate purpose overcomes the
purpose and effect to disparage and to injure those whom the State, by its
marriage laws, sought to protect in personhood and dignity.  By seeking to
displace this protection and treating those persons as living in marriages
less respected than others, the federal statute is in violation of the
Fifth Amendment.  This opinion and its holding are confined to those lawful
marriages.

The relative freedom which we enjoy depends of public opinion.  The law is
no protection.  Governments make laws, but whether they are carried out,
and how the police behave, depends on the general temper in the country.
If large numbers of people are interested in freedom of speech, there will
be freedom of speech, even if the law forbids it; if public opinion is
sluggish, inconvenient minorities will be persecuted, even if laws exist to
protect them.

What's important here are government programs and methods, not data about
individuals.  I understand I am asking for people to engage in illegal and
dangerous behavior.  Do it carefully and do it safely, but -- and I am
talking directly to you, person working on one of these secret and probably
illegal programs -- do it.
 
If you see something, say something.  There are many people in the U.S.
that will appreciate and admire you.
 
For the rest of us, we can help by protesting this war on whistleblowers.
We need to force our politicians not to punish them -- to investigate the
abuses and not the messengers -- and to ensure that those unjustly
persecuted can obtain redress.
 
Our government is putting its own self-interest ahead of the interests of
the country.  That needs to change.

A rational anarchist believes that concepts such as "state" and "society"
and "government" have no existence save as physically exemplified in the
acts of self-responsible individuals.  He believes that it is impossible to
shift blame, share blame, distribute blame ... as blame, guilt,
responsibility are matters taking place inside human beings singly and
nowhere else.  But being rational, he knows that not all individuals hold
his evaluations, so he tries to live perfectly in an imperfect world ...
aware that his effort will be less than perfect yet undismayed by
self-knowledge of self-failure.

And for those who resist that idea that we should think about something
like these "stand your ground" laws, I'd just ask people to consider, if
Trayvon Martin was of age and armed, could he have stood his ground on that
sidewalk?  And do we actually think that he would have been justified in
shooting Mr. Zimmerman who had followed him in a car because he felt
threatened?  And if the answer to that question is at least ambiguous, then
it seems to me that we might want to examine those kinds of laws.

Creativity is just connecting things.  When you ask creative people how
they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do
it, they just saw something.  It seemed obvious to them after a while.
That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and
synthesize new things.  And the reason they were able to do that was that
they've had more experiences or they have thought more about their
experiences than other people.

43:57.2 to cover 400 yards swimming (7:05), 6 miles bicycling (18:34), and
2 miles running (15:13), plus transitions.
 
Overall 29th out of 192 finishers, 5th in my (relatively fast) age group,
50-54; I would have been 3rd had I been 1:09 faster.  
 
Interestingly, the fastest age groups were 40-44, 15-19, 50-54, and 20-24.
The 40-44 group had 6 in the top 20, finishing 2nd, 4th, 6th, 12th, 16th,
and 19th.  Apparently going through your first mid-life crisis is key to
taking triathlon seriously.

There were 11 total age groups for each gender, so even the 4th-best Men's
20..24 group was above average (judged by number of, and relative, places
within the top 30).
 
Now that I've seen the full results, I see that the first place competitor
was also in the Men's 40..44 age group, giving them 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 16, and
19 among the top 30.
 
The oldest age group was 60+ with only 3 male and 3 female particpants, the
fastest male of whom was just 2 minutes off my time, for 39th overall.

Only ten people in American history have been charged with espionage for
leaking classified information, seven of them under Barack Obama.  The
effect of the charge on a person's life -- being viewed as a traitor, being
shunned by family and friends, incurring massive legal bills -- is all a
part of the plan to force the whistleblower into personal ruin, to weaken
him to the point where he will plead guilty to just about anything to make
the case go away.

I have been forced to make a difficult decision: to become complicit in
crimes against the American people or walk away from nearly ten years of
hard work by shutting down Lavabit.  After significant soul searching, I
have decided to suspend operations.  I wish that I could legally share with
you the events that led to my decision.  I cannot.  I feel you deserve to
know what's going on -- the first amendment is supposed to guarantee me the
freedom to speak out in situations like this.  Unfortunately, Congress has
passed laws that say otherwise.  As things currently stand, I cannot share
my experiences over the last six weeks, even though I have twice made the
appropriate requests.
 
...  This experience has taught me one very important lesson: without
congressional action or a strong judicial precedent, I would _strongly_
recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with
physical ties to the United States.

The Privacy Seppuku pledge is simple: if a company is served with a secret
order to become a real-time participant in ongoing, blanket, secret
surveillance of its customers... it will say no.  Just say no.  And it will
shut down its operations, rather than have them infiltrated by spies and
used surreptitiously to spread the NSA's global spook malware further.  You
can't force a company to do something if there's no company there to do it.
 
... That one that went thru with the seppuku?  She'll likely have a new
service up and running in a few days or weeks.  The customers who got
dinged by the shutdown?  They'll all get up and running on her new service.
This is all 1s and 0s, remember?  You don't have to demolish a car
manufacturing plant, after all - you're just wiping some VMs and
reincorporating elsewhere.  Lease new machines.  Call it "lavabutt" on the
new corporate docs, in Andorra.  Sign on to the Privacy Seppuku pledge, as
lavabutt, again.  Off you go.  Do you think it'll be hard to get customers
- old ones migrated over, and new ones alike?  Think on that: a privacy
company that shut down rather than be #snitchware... do you trust them,
now?

exercise our freedom; yet by concentrating power in political hands, it is
also a threat to freedom.  Even though the men who wield this power

power they exercise, the power will both attract and form men of a

The owner of Lavabit tells us that he's stopped using email and if we knew
what he knew, we'd stop too.  There is no way to do Groklaw without email.
Therein lies the conundrum.  What to do?
 
What to do? I've spent the last couple of weeks trying to figure it out.
And the conclusion I've reached is that there is no way to continue doing
Groklaw, not long term, which is incredibly sad.  But it's good to be
realistic.  And the simple truth is, no matter how good the motives might
be for collecting and screening everything we say to one another, and no
matter how "clean" we all are ourselves from the standpoint of the
screeners, I don't know how to function in such an atmosphere.  I don't

know how to do Groklaw like this. ...
 
My personal decision is to get off of the Internet to the degree it's
possible.  I'm just an ordinary person.  But I really know, after all my
research and some serious thinking things through, that I can't stay online
personally without losing my humanness, now that I know that ensuring
privacy online is impossible.  I find myself unable to write.  I've always
been a private person.  That's why I never wanted to be a celebrity and why
I fought hard to maintain both my privacy and yours.
 
Oddly, if everyone did that, leap off the Internet, the world's economy
would collapse, I suppose.  I can't really hope for that.  But for me, the
Internet is over.
 
So this is the last Groklaw article.  I won't turn on comments.  Thank you
for all you've done.  I will never forget you and our work together.  I
hope you'll remember me too.  I'm sorry I can't overcome these feelings,

The fact is, that civilization requires slaves.  The Greeks were quite
right there.  Unless there are slaves to do the ugly, horrible,
uninteresting work, culture and contemplation become almost impossible.
Human slavery is wrong, insecure, and demoralizing.  On mechanical slavery,

I have written my life in small sketches, a little today, a little
yesterday, as I have thought of it, as I remember all the things from
childhood on through the years, good ones, and unpleasant ones, that is how
they come out and that is how we have to take them.
 
I look back on my life like a good day's work, it was done and I am
satisfied with it.  I was happy and contented, I knew nothing better and
made the best out of what life offered.  And life is what we make it,
always has been, always will be.

Unlike NSA's collection of phone records under a court order, it is clear
to me that certain surveillance activities have been in effect for more
than a decade and that the Senate Intelligence Committee was not
satisfactorily informed.  Therefore our oversight needs to be strengthened
and increased ....  Unless the United States is engaged in hostilities
against a country or there is an emergency need for this type of
surveillance, I do not believe the United States should be collecting phone
calls or emails of friendly presidents and prime ministers.  The president
should be required to approve any collection of this sort.

Sitting in front of my fireplace, basking in it's warm glow gives me time
to reflect upon the sacrifices that it has taken for me to enjoy the
security of a good home, in a safe environment.  I can hear the soft
whisper of the snow as it caresses my window and covers the ground outside
in a scintillating display of sparkling lights under the full moon.  How
many times have our service men and women watched this same scene from a
foxhole, or camped in some remote part of the world.  Thankful for the
silence of that moment, knowing it won't last long.  Yes, Virginia, there
is a Santa Claus.  He/she dresses in fatigues and patrols the world
restlessly, ensuring that we can have this peaceful night.  Every day they
give us the gift of this lifestyle that we enjoy, and every night they
watch over us.  They are warriors, angels, guardians, friends, brothers,
fathers, mothers, sisters and brothers, forming a family that stretches
back to the beginning of the country.  So tonight when you go to bed say a
prayer that God watch over those who watch over us, and thank them for
their sacrifices, on and off the battlefield.  Pray that they have a
peaceful night, and will be home soon with their families who also share
their burden.  Without them we would not have this moment.

Miley's business judgement is sound, even if her moral judgement is
questionable.
 
= Not strictly respecting others' bad judgement, but respecting the right
of others to practice exercising their judgement, even if some of those
attempts are apparent failures.  
 
If they're ever going to get good at using and trusting their own
judgement, kids need to practice exercising their judgement in a setting
where they will not be overly criticized for the outcome.  It helps them
develop into autonomous individuals.  I've seen kids grow before my eyes
when they ask me for direction on some task, and I tell them to use their
best judgement.  Sometimes the results are not what I expect, and sometimes
I learn something new in the process.
 
The "greater good" is roughly "think globally, act locally", though in my
own case it took years to evolve from self to family to community and
eventually to society at large, with regular and significant lapses.

How does big government fit in this? (not saying you are or aren't in favor
it.) How is it "respecting the right of others to practice exercising their
judgement" if the government is going to force people to buy healthcare
plans they would otherwise never buy? You seem to argue that people should
be allowed to make choices, but with healthcare, lots of choices were
ripped from the us.  Or force people to wear seat belts?  How am I
exercising a right if my choice is punishable by law? You seem to be
arguing for self-government with a pretty libertarian world view. If
everyone learns and exercises sound judgement, then there would be no need
for government to provide social security, medicare, etc. (any program that
hits more than half the population.)

Well, the base note is meant as a family mission statement.  So, the
individuals practicing (not to mean "employing", but to mean "learning how
to use, through trial and error") their judgement are young siblings.
 
Personally, regarding health care, I think single payer is the way to go.
Something along the lines of Medicare for all.  We seem to accept that some
minimum amount of healthcare is a right.  The question becomes "how much
healthcare is a right?"
 
Right now, emergency rooms stay busy caring for people without insurance
who exercise this right.  That money has to come from somewhere, and we
currently, societally, pretend it doesn't.  Part of the higher medical
costs we pay today are due to higher rates charged by hospitals to recoup
their losses on the uninsured.  Those higher rates cost individuals
increased out-of-pocket, and higher insurance premiums.  We're already
paying for it, we're just not admitting it to ourselves.  Let's organize it
and make it more efficient than it is right now.
 
Doctors complain about the huge overhead of having to deal with dozens of
insurers.  See this excellent article in Business Week:
 
http://tinyurl.com/nsfqrlk
 
Forbes cites "... 85 percent of excess administrative overhead can be
attributed to the insurance system.  Administrative costs for physicians
are in the range of 25-30 percent of practice revenues and
insurance-related costs are 15 percent of revenues, according to a National
Academy of Social Insurance report for The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation."

Single payer fixes that.

Constitution of the State of Illinois
ARTICLE XIII, SECTION 5 -- PENSION AND RETIREMENT RIGHTS
 
Membership in any pension or retirement system of the State, any unit of
local government or school district, or any agency or instrumentality
thereof, shall be an enforceable contractual relationship, the benefits of
which shall not be diminished or impaired.

I'll be interested to see how that reconciles with the apparent 30%
reduction in the 20-year value of my pension that just got voted into law
in Illinois.

Easy.  You aren't getting it yet, therefore what you are getting isn't
being reduced.

The contract clearly says that the value of the membership shall not be
impaired.  It didn't say anything about the value of the pension not being
impaired.
 
In Dale's case, the 30% reduction is clearly justifiable.  Why should the
taxpayers be paying for all of that fancy photography equipment and trips to
Alaska?  Can you imagine the public outrage if a congressman tried to do
that?

1)  It is not a contract it is the state constitution.
2)  It does not say value it says benefits.  The pension IS A benefit of
    membership in the classs (of retirees).
3)  I earned that pension as a condition of employment.
4)  I contributed MORE than my half.  The state has consistently failed to
    contribute its half.  THAT is the source of the problem.
5)  Had the state not taken my contribution I could have invested it.
6)  WTF does how I spend MY money have to do with anything.  :)

Indeed, it's analogous to working as a non-government employee, and paying
your Social Security taxes, while your employer skips paying their half.
Then when you retire, you only get 70% retirement because your employer
skipped paying their half of the Social Security tax.
 
They're getting 8% from me up front, which is a higher tax than Social
Security's 6.2%, and they're denying me the option of participating in
Social Security instead of the SURS pension system.  The contracts
negotiated with the state that created the pension system included lower
up-front pay, to save the state money up front, in exchange for a
comfortable retirement.
 
Of course everyone knows that the weasle politicans would want to weasle
out of paying in the end, and it's that knowledge that led to the inclusion
of the BN text in the state constitution.  The fact that it's possible to
calculate the reduction in pension benefits to employees leads ipso facto
to the conclusion that the pension bill violates this constitutional
clause.  I expect, however, that the Supreme Court will let it stand.

[S]ome people continue to defend trickle-down theories which assume that
economic growth, encouraged by a free market, will inevitably succeed in
bringing about greater justice and inclusiveness in the world.  This
opinion, which has never been confirmed by the facts, expresses a crude and
naive trust in the goodness of those wielding economic power and in the
sacralized workings of the prevailing economic system.  Meanwhile, the
excluded are still waiting.

We understand that governments have a duty to protect their citizens.  But
this summer's revelations highlighted the urgent need to reform government
surveillance practices worldwide.  The balance in many countries has tipped
too far in favor of the state and away from the rights of the individual --
rights that are enshrined in our Constitution.  This undermines the
freedoms we all cherish. It's time for a change.
 
For our part, we are focused on keeping users' data secure -- deploying the
latest encryption technology to prevent unauthorized surveillance on our
networks and by pushing back on government requests to ensure that they are
legal and reasonable in scope.
 
We urge the US to take the lead and make reforms that ensure that
government surveillance efforts are clearly restricted by law,
proportionate to the risks, transparent and subject to independent
oversight.  To see the full set of principles we support, visit

I cannot imagine a more "indiscriminate" and "arbitrary" invasion than this
systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on
virtually every single citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it
without prior judicial approval.  ...  Surely, such a program infringes on
"that degree of privacy" that the founders enshrined in the Fourth
Amendment. ...
 
The question that I will ultimately have to answer when I reach the merits
of this case someday is whether people have a reasonable expectation of
privacy that is violated when the government, without any basis whatsoever
to suspect them of any wrongdoing, collects and stores for five years their
telephony metadata for purposes of subjecting it to high-tech querying and
analysis without any case-by-case judicial approval.

In the United States the question "Is money a form of speech?" is an
important legal question, because of the protection afforded speech under
the US Constitution.  In my (legally uninformed) opinion digital money may
make this issue more complicated.  As we'll see, the Bitcoin protocol is
really a way of standing up before the rest of the world (or at least the
rest of the Bitcoin network) and avowing "I'm going to give such-and-such a
number of bitcoins to so-and-so a person" in a way that's extremely
difficult to repudiate.  At least naively, it looks more like speech than
exchanging copper coins, say.

offer Mr. Snowden a plea bargain or some form of clemency that would allow
him to return home, face at least substantially reduced punishment in light
of his role as a whistle-blower, and have the hope of a life advocating for
greater privacy and far stronger oversight of the runaway intelligence
community. ...

If I take a letter, lock it in a safe, hide the safe somewhere in New York,
then tell you to read the letter, that's not security.  That's obscurity.
On the other hand, if I take a letter, and lock it in a safe, and then give
you the safe along with the design specifications of the safe and a hundred
identical safes with their combinations so that you and the world's best
safecrackers can study the locking mechanism -- and you still can't open
the safe and read the letter -- that's security.

We squandered the goodwill of the world after we were attacked by our
actions in Guantanamo, both in terms of detention and torture.  Our
decision to keep Guantanamo open has helped our enemies because it
validates every negative perception of the United States.
 
It is time that the American people and our politicians accepted a level of
risk in the defense of our constitutional values, just as our service men
and women have gone into harm's way time after time to defend our
Constitution.  If we make a mockery of our values, it calls us to question
what we are really fighting for.                            
 
It is time to close Guantanamo.  Our departure from Afghanistan is a
perfect point in history to close the facility.

In 1786, the Virginia General Assembly affirmed an ideal that has long been
central to the American journey.  The Virginia Statute for Religious
Freedom, penned by Thomas Jefferson, declared religious liberty a natural
right and any attempt to subvert it "a departure from the plan of the Holy
Author of our religion, who being Lord both of body and mind, yet chose not
to propagate it by coercions on either." The Statute inspired religious
liberty protections in the First Amendment, which has stood for almost two
and a quarter centuries.
 
Today, America embraces people of all faiths and of no faith.  We are
Christians and Jews, Muslims and Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs, atheists and
agnostics.  Our religious diversity enriches our cultural fabric and
reminds us that what binds us as one is not the tenets of our faiths, the
colors of our skin, or the origins of our names.  What makes us American is
our adherence to shared ideals -- freedom, equality, justice, and our right
as a people to set our own course.

better than destruction.  I prefer gentleness to violence, forgiveness to
vendetta.  I believe that in spite of the recent triumphs of science, men
haven't changed much in the last two thousand years; and in consequence we
must still try to learn from history.  History is ourselves.

When mistakes are made -- which is inevitable in any large and complicated
human enterprise, they correct those mistakes, laboring in obscurity, often
unable to discuss their work even with family and friends -- the men and
women at the NSA know that if another 9/11 or massive cyber attack occurs,
they will be asked by Congress and the media why they failed to connect the
dots.  What sustains those who work at NSA and our other intelligence
agencies through all these pressures is the knowledge that their
professionalism and dedication play a central role in the defense of our
nation.
 
Now, to say that our intelligence community follows the law and is staffed
by patriots is not to suggest that I or others in my administration felt
complacent about the potential impact of these programs.  Those of us who
hold office in America have a responsibility to our Constitution.  And
while I was confident in the integrity of those who lead our intelligence
community, it was clear to me in observing our intelligence operations on a
regular basis that changes in our technological capabilities were raising
new questions about the privacy safeguards currently in place.

[W]hat I believe unites the people of this nation, regardless of race or
region or party, young or old, rich or poor, is the simple, profound belief
in opportunity for all -- the notion that if you work hard and take
responsibility, you can get ahead.
 
Let's face it: that belief has suffered some serious blows.  ...
 
The cold, hard fact is that even in the midst of recovery, too many
Americans are working more than ever just to get by -- let alone get ahead.
And too many still aren't working at all. ...
 
But America does not stand still -- and neither will I.  So wherever and
whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for
more American families, that's what I'm going to do.
 
Opportunity is who we are.  And the defining project of our generation is
to restore that promise.

In light of the bill permitting guns on our state's college and university
campuses, which is likely to be approved by the state House of
Representatives in the coming days, I have a matter of practical concern
that I hope you can help with: When may I shoot a student?
 
I am a biology professor, not a lawyer, and I had never considered bringing
a gun to work until now.  But since many of my students are likely to be
armed, I thought it would be a good idea to even the playing field.
 
I have had encounters with disgruntled students over the years, some of
whom seemed quite upset, but I always assumed that when they reached into

I mean that.  I mean that Moscow -- look at it through Moscow's eyes.
Since the Clinton administration in the 1990s, the U.S.-led West has been
on a steady march toward post-Soviet Russia, began with the expansion of
NATO in the 1990s under Clinton.  Bush then further expanded NATO all the
way to Russia's borders.  Then came the funding of what are euphemistically
called NGOs, but they are political action groups, funded by the West,
operating inside Russia.  Then came the decision to build missile defense
installations along Russia's borders, allegedly against Iran, a country
which has neither nuclear weapons nor any missiles to deliver them with.
Then comes American military outpost in the former Soviet republic of
Georgia, which led to the war of 2008, and now the West is at the gates of
Ukraine.  So, that's the picture as Moscow sees it.  And it's rational.
It's reasonable.  It's hard to deny.

I think it's tough to pick any one thing and designate it as being the
highest, always overriding, value.
 
Here's an example regarding truth.  Back at the time of the first Gulf War,
there were accusations that the only reason Congress was willing to go along
was that there had been false testimony about supposed horrific depradations
by the Iraqis in Kuwaiti hospitals.  In my opinion (held firmly if not very
happily), if this was true, the people who did it did a right thing:  It was
more important to stomp on the brazen aggression than to stick to the truth.
 
Am I saying that as a general principle it's OK to lie in order to get what
you want?  Of course not.  I'm only saying that sometimes events present
only bad choices, and one should not shrink from the least-bad one even
when it may be very bad.

[The majority's] conclusion rests upon its own, not a record-based, view of
the facts.  Its legal analysis is faulty: It misconstrues the nature of the
competing constitutional interests at stake.  It understates the importance
of protecting the political integrity of our governmental institutions.  It
creates a loophole that will allow a single individual to contribute
millions of dollars to a political party or to a candidate's campaign.
Taken together with Citizens United v. Federal Election Comm'n, today's
decision eviscerates our Nation's campaign finance laws, leaving a remnant
incapable of dealing with the grave problems of democratic legitimacy that
those laws were intended to resolve.

the quickness of the mental jump, the daring of the youthful intuition, the

for a time much greater than the whole life of the man who thought it.

This past Saturday 26 April was the Illinois Marathon, and that day I ran
my first official *half* marathon.
 
My time was 1:52:03 for 13.1 miles.  That works out to 8:33 per mile, or
about 7.0 miles per hour.  I was expecting 1:57, and hoping for 1:55.
 
Placing:
Overall     : 927/5648  top 16%
Gender      : 663/2264  top 29%
Age Group   : 54/218    top 25%
 
Had it been 9 days later (my birthday is coming up), I would have been 26th
in my (older) age group.
 
Interestingly, the results page continues to change, even today.  On
Saturday night I was listed in the overall at 948/5670.  I have moved up 21
positions since then, while the total has dropped by 22 runners.  The other
placings have also changed a bit, including dropping from 50th to 54th in
my age group.  And my time improved by a second between Saturday morning
and Saturday evening.

Music will always find its way to us, with or without business, politics,
religion, or any other bullshit attached.  Music survives everything, and
like God, it is always present.  It needs no help, and suffers no
hindrance.

Who are you and who am I
    To say we know the reason why
Some are born, some men die,
    Beneath one infinite sky?
 
There'll be war, there'll be peace,
    But everything one day will cease,
All the iron turned to rust,
    All the proud men turned to dust,
 
And so all things time will mend,
    So this song will end.

Printer's ink has been running a race against gunpowder these many, many
years.  Ink is handicapped, in a way, because you can blow up a man with
gunpowder in half a second, while it may take twenty years to blow him up
with a book.  But the gunpowder destroys itself along with its victim,
while a book can keep on exploding for centuries.

Imagination has brought mankind through the Dark Ages to its present state
of civilization.  Imagination led Columbus to discover America.
Imagination led Franklin to discover electricity.  Imagination has given us
the steam engine, the telephone, the talking-machine, and the automobile,
for these things had to be dreamed of before they became realities.  So I
believe that dreams -- day dreams, you know, with your eyes wide open and
your brain machinery whizzing -- are likely to lead to the betterment of
the world.  The imaginative child will become the imaginative man or woman
most apt to create, to invent, and therefore to foster civilization.  A
prominent educator tells me that fairy tales are of untold value in
developing imagination in the young.  I believe it.

Technology has been a liberating force in our lives.  It allows us to
create and share the experiences that make us human, effortlessly.  But in
secret, our very own government -- one bound by the Constitution and its
Bill of Rights -- has reverse-engineered something beautiful into a tool of
mass surveillance and oppression.  The government right now can easily
monitor whom you call, whom you associate with, what you read, what you
buy, and where you go online and offline, and they do it to all of us, all
the time.
