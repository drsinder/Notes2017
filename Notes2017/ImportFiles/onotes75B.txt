hi does anyone have any lessons dealing with blood cancer
or leukemia.......it is important that i find some info
about this disease? Thank you.

suggest if you seriously need some information to check
with a physician... in this area a little knowledge is
very dangerous... if it is for a term paper, try any
good medical library, ask for the Index Medicus and
in the first volume of each annual issue, there is
a section which lists review articles, alphabetically
by subject... this would be a good starting point...

so would any textbook on "hematology"

to my knowledge there is no plato lesson which deals
expressly with this subject

if you want one of the more up-to-date texts on leukemia
i would recommend that you take a look at the
Univ of Rochester Clinical Oncology...
        i agree with george that it is very important to
look up info on this field for it is a rapidly changing
one, and it would be very dangerous if you wanted this info
to give to folks who are in some direct contact with this
group of diseases...

I suggest you leave a pnote for mary manteuffel, com.
col. biology coordinator (marym; biocc). she has cataloged
many of the biology lessons and could indicate what might
be useful, but i doubt if it will be as specific as your
request. pauline jordan

Anyone who is interested in working on an inter-school and
even an inter-disciplinary project whose purpose is to
coordinate and/or set certain data collection standards
in the continuing development of:

a) Lessons in mass communications;
b) Lessons in management of media as commercial enterprises
c) General broadcast lessons (production, news, management,
   programming, etc);

Please contact me. There is a discussion project underway
in which you might be interested. Our group has recently
organized such lessons as we know about into a general index
which allows the participants to review the work of others.

At what level are you collecting data (secondary, com. coll.
or univ. ?) There is a lot of work going on in the commun-
ity colleges: we have a reasonably complete list I could
send you. Our Communications faculty would be very interes-
ted in co-operating with this study, I think. If you could
t me know more about it in a pnote, I'll respond soon....

---------- note 21 mult restr
  04/15     10.41     meers       wright

Anyone who wishes to use the system router, yet wishes to
restrict certain multiples to certain logical sites, and/or
to certain days and times of the week, may do so with a
little work and some help which I would be willing to give.

        The system router allows the course director to
choose a sequence for any individual or group of students.
If you create a multiple, and send him into a sequence, you
are given the choice of sending him to the course index, or
of kicking him off - when he is finished with all the
lessons in that sequence.

        To control a multiple signon, simply create a
sequence of one lesson, and make him go through that
lesson before he is allowed to go to the index. Every time
he signs on, he will have to go through that first lesson
because he is a 'multiple' signon, and restart information
is not saved.

---------- response 1
  04/15     10.55     meers       wright

A student is only flagged as having finished a lesson if he
has first hit an 'end lesson' or a 'lesson completed'..
    To control the signon, simply place a number of checks
in the lesson using such reserved words as 'ptime', 'day',
'clock', 'sitenam' etc.
    If it is an allowable time, day, and site, branch the
student to a unit that contains an 'end lesson', or a
'lesson completed'.. If it is not an allowable day,
or if it is not an allowable time, or if it is prime time,
or if it is not your logical site, then branch the student
to a unit that gives him an informational message, and
the a 'pause keys=stop1,next' 'jumpout plato'..

---------- response 2
  04/15     11.32     meers       wright

¬?ˆa sample format:

unit    check
day     v1
jump    sitenam='wright',x,badsite $$ signon can only be
                       used at logical site 'wright'.
define  dow?int(7frac(v1=7)) $$ dow contains 0-6 depending
                       on day of week (mon=0 tue=1 sun=6)
jump    dow=5$or$dow=6,letemin,x $$ usage allowed anytime
                on saturday(5) or sunday(6)
jump   dow=4$and$(frac(v1)>(16/24),letemin,x $$ if it is
            after 4 (1600) pm on friday let em in
jump   ptime,notptim,letemin $mon thru thurs they cant get
            on if it is prime time

unit badsite write 'Bad Site!' pause keys =stop1?
unit notptim write 'not prime time ! press stop1'
     pause keys=stop1?
unit letemin press next  end lesson

  04/15     11.35     meers       wright

this technique has worked well, and with a little bit of
logic and intelligence, it can be expanded to allow certain
hours of each seperate day. the student does not see
any message if he is at the proper site on the right
day at the right time.. He only sees a message if
he is at a bad site or if he has come during hours
that are not open to that signon..

This is a pretty nifty idea. I might put it into the
playdo router since stud is a multiple. Then I can control
its use very carefully at our site, see how much use it gets
at other sites, and still do so without making it unavail-
able to the other sites.
In fact I would be willing to put other multiples in the
playdo router for exclusive use at other sites, and put
each in a special sequence designed to do ecs and cpu
checks with a "pre-router" lesson supplied by that site.

Anybody want that......(not all at once - please).

execution error: "tutor output buffer overflow"

This unit will cause it every tiem:

unit   one
calc   n1?n2?n3?n4?n5?'abcdefghij'
size   .8
at     801
showa  n1,50

It can be fixed by changing the -showa-s:
at     801
showa  n1,20
showa	n3,30

but I thought that "output buffer
overflow" was supposed to be fixed?

---------- note 30 access
  04/15     11.54     preece       cerl

I realize that all the arguments about games and access have
been circulated before, though I lack the energy to find
the instances in old notes, but I would like to know future
aims of plato. Anyone who has been at Dartmouth knows that
open access can work. It could work here, given expanded
capacity. Is it intended that at some future time all
students have access to the system?
More immediately, couldn't there be a signon available so
that anyone could get on during offprime hours?It seems
ridiculous that the body of educational material here is
only available to authors. If a student wants to study
a language, or mathematics in his free time, he ought to
be able to use the lessons that exist, whether or not he
is in a course.
Of course, I believe in games, too, but I agree they
should be for offprime use only at current resource levels.
The system is a resource, like libraries.

---------- response 1
  04/15     13.00     berger       users

We have a relatively free access. Most course directors
are happy to give someone a student signon if the sincerely
wishes to study a subject on his own. The problem enters
when the signon is abused, or when a person doesn't want
to study the material, but rather intends to use the signon
to provide access to illegitimate use of games.

---------- response 2
  04/15     13.25     golden       s

One of the differences between PLATO and time-shared comput-
ing as at Dartmouth is the fact that serious use of PLATO
takes an hour or more per use. We have 35,000 students.
Anything like free access would guarantee that those
students with PLATO assignments would be unable to find
terminals. Now if we had 2000 terminals on campus, it
probably would work.

---------- response 3
  04/15     14.35     preece       cerl

The size disparity is obvious. Curiously, the 2000
terminal guess is what I had arrived at, too. On the
other hand there are still times when the machine is not
saturated, and there are plans for upgrading the system;
I wondered whether some more free access could be made
available offprime now, and whether future planning
included open access as a goal.
More important than length of session is function of
session. Dartmouth students use far less time in lessons,
far more time in writing their own code. But a large
library of games is available all the time and has not
been a serious problem at any time.

---------- response 4
  04/15     15.14     hody       med

if i am not mistaken, the dartmouth system is extremely
careful about precise allocation of resources... thus
it is impossible for any student to degrade the system
performance in any way by anything (s)he does... further,
as bill golden points out, plato is much more terminal
oriented... with plato you can't do much away from
the terminal while at dartmouth it might be fair to
say most of your work would be done away from the
terminal-- leaving a lot of terminal time for
interactive games, i guess...

just out of curiosity, what are the parameters of
the dartmouth system in terms of no. of simultaneous
time=shared users; turnaround time; graphics capability;
resources available to each user; etc......

---------- response 5
  04/15     17.01     deiss       phar

Some of you might want to take a second look at the
mult restrictor note above (I think it is number 21?).

---------- response 6
  04/16     08.17     preece       cerl

the dartmouth system supports 200 or so terminals (or it
did the last i knew). every student has free use of the
system - your id number is your signon - and has about
4k words of disk for storing his programs. student
programs can be up to 16k(compiled) and can use up to 60
seconds of cpu per run. all of those parameters can be
changed on request if you have an even vaguely reasonable
purpose. graphics capability is defined by the terminal you
have - the machine will send any ascii character; numerous
graphics support routines are available for the various
terminal types (interactive 8?10 pen plotters are widely
available on campus, also).
in terms of allocation of resources, it's a fairly normal
time-sharing system. core residence and execution quanta
are fairly small. it pages off a drum. response time is
quite good, though mostly low baud.

---------- response 7
  04/16     08.26     preece       cerl

the terminal communications problem is passed on to a set
of communications processors, so the cpu gets only
complete lines of text from the terminals.
it is not possible for a game to hog the system because the
system is very fair about scheduling core quanta. the
system is also designed to get fast jobs taken care of
quickly (as your cpu increases the interval between corn
quanta increases, as does their lenght).
the only restriction on game playing is that work has
priority in terminal allocation - you can kick off gamers.
i don't think sessions are paticularly shorter than here,
but i would agree that the ratio of off-terminal think time
to on-terminal time is much higher. in terms of total
system utilization, however, i think they keep quite as
busy. 90: of all students there can program, and they do.

---------- response 8
  04/16     09.40     hody       med

another important point/question:

is there true interactive computer-based education
on that system? and if so, how long would it take
to respond to a typical student "request" or response
with all 200 terminals running?

---------- response 9
  04/16     11.33     preece       cerl

there is a significant amount of cai use of the system,
of all varieties. response time varies depending on load
and is sometimes degraded to several seconds for starting
a program (most programs are compiled each time they are
run and are not shared, although compilers are shared), but
time to respond after a student response is usually
nominal. some users are also heavy disk users (espcially the
sociology system which allows students to massage several
large data bases, and the library's cataloging and other
programs). an upgrade to newer equipment is currently
under consideration - the present configuration is almost
five years old (though disk space has increased in that
time). the system runs on the order of 15-20,000 jobs a day.

One other question:

Who pays for the "free" access (i.e. computer time, etc.)
Is it a resource provided to the students by the "U",
as a library would be?

---------- response 11
  04/16     20.26     carter       cs491

Yes, that is exactly the analogy Dr. Kemeny, President
of Dartmouth and noted computer scientist, uses.

---------- response 12
  04/16     22.41     hody       med

i think the difference in speeds between plato and the
dartmouth system has not been emphasized enough-- by this
i mean the response speed of the computer and of the
terminal, both... i have no experience with the
dartmouth system but i do not believe the plato system
can support totally free access at this time... i know
it can't-- it is having enough trouble with the access
it is now getting..

the problem, though, isn't that plato isn't great-- just
that plato doesn't seem to protect itself enough against
resource draining-- to retain a high flexibility for
unusual applications-- also the hgih response speed
(terminal particularly) promotes high rate of resource
use...
and doesn't want to classify lower grades of uses and
users than it now has... under those conditions it
can't be a library resource...

pity, though, it's a marvelous analogy...

I have 2 questions:
       First:How can you use a game illigitemately?
       Second,Why have the games at all it people
       can't use them? ...I see no reason to have
       games at all unless the average person can
       use them.Usually during non prime time hours
       there are empty terminals..if game playing
       is a problem with a multiple signon...just
       kick the game players out that night
       I think that HOARDING the games(and that is
       exactly what you are doing) is unfair to the
       student(UI)-some of whose money is going to
       plato!

---------- response 14
  04/20     22.13     silver       ve

The games are there because people wrote them, not because
it was decided to "have" them! The problem is allocation
of resources for the things that it was decided to "have"
-- education programs -- because these are what pay for the
system. How on earth one "hoards" games, I don't know, but
until someone comes up with a way for gameplayers to pay
their own way (and with games that do not use an inordinate
amount of cpu) I guess we will have restrictions, hm?

I like it.....did you take your comments straight from
Prof. Scanlan's (ClCiv 111) notes? They sound like
his style.

One comment: I started with part -c- and worked my way
back to -a-, and so didn't get any instructions on using
only Greek names, and got VERY frustrated while trying
to type in 'Ulysses' instead of 'Odysseus'. Maybe those
instructions should be put in the introduction to the
lesson.........

---------- response 3
  04/16     12.02     preece       cerl

The variation in style of instruction is interesting.
The hints in part a seemed generally intelligent. Part c
is really too easy - the combination of text and a testing
method that displays all names at once is too much of a
help.
I fell through from part b into part c, i trust that was
what you intended?
Feedback on performance at the end of each section would
be very desifable.

how about a system-implemented check to catch segment assign
overflows (¬+ set the segments value to 2?ˆseglength??-1 if
overflow is true) -- this can be -do-ne (-do-ed?) in a unit
and a faster way is to use a define like:?
fit(expr,seglong)=expr+(expr-(2?ˆseglong??-1))(expr>(2?ˆseglong??-1)

As michael does, so do I. I would hate to start getting
exec errors because of segment overflow. I do wish that the
few cases where ?int(exp) is needed to get a meaningful
number into the segment were cleaned up.

---------- response 3
  04/15     18.18     layman       matha

what i suggested was an optional overflow check, indentified
by some key in the define -- i didnt ask for exec errors,
but loading the segment w/ its maximum value -- now if you
try to store the number, 10, in a 3-bit seg, you get 2
instead -- the "8" bit is lost in the masking -- by setting
the segment to its maximum value you get a meaningful value
in the case of an overflow -- of course, you should try to
use segments that are long enough for any value, but you
might choose a length shorter than that if the overflow
case is either unlikely (but possible) or you arent
interested in specific values past a certain limit (but want
to know that limit was achieved) -- TL

although an overflow indicator of one sort or another
would be nice, the additional checks required would cause
segment processing to be even slower than present.
lessons which lean heavily on segmentation for efficeint
variable utilization would pay a heavy price in cpu time.

currently, segments require approx. 2400: the processing
time of full words. let's not slow it down anymore.

(that percentage was based on a simplistic benchmark of
10000 itterations, replacing n2?1 with d(1)?1 where d
is a 6 bit segment. loop processing was subtracted from
total proctims)

  04/15     19.26     alan       reading

What are the chances of increasing the upper limit (as long
as there must be an upper limit) of storage to 1500 words?
I am not familiar with why the limit was originally set
at 1000 words (ECS? - 3 block disk access buffer?) but it
would be nice if one could use all 1500 nc vars and it
would save (me) disk accesses.

---------- response 1
  04/16     05.06     blomme       s

   I certainly concur with a change from 1000 to 1500
in the limit in storage length--in fact, this question
was brought up just a week ago and I think that most of
us agreed that the reasons for the limitations are mainly
historical and somewhat outdated. It seems quite rational
to make the limit correspond to the vc vars limit of 1500.
Sorry, no estimate of when such a change might be forth-
coming, but someone will probably change that parameter
sometime soon I would guess.

What _were_===_¬___ ¬ the 'historic' reasons?

---------- response 4
  04/16     17.41     tenczar       s

The main historical reason was...-storage- came into being
when the system editor was re-written in TUTOR. The
editor needed to bring in (1) the directory block of a
lesson from the disk, (2) the source block that is
currently being edited, and (3) an extra block for the
save buffer. Three blocks, each 322 words long, yield
966 words of extra storage per user... so we just made
it 1000 for "cleanliness". Thus, at this time, -storage-
had no relation to the 1500 words of nc-type variables.
Also, although we allowed any lesson to use -storage-...it
was not encouraged...and now, it seems everybody wants to
use it...and we are able to account for it in the ECS
allocation scheme to each logical site (which didn't exist
at first).

Because all notes are numbered in the order they were

Just in case you people haven't read New System Features
for the last week or two:

        There are a couple new commands...
lesson incomplete and lesson completed

    'lesson completed' can be placed near the end of all
lessons, and once a system routed student has passed the
command, he can shift stop off, and still be flagged as
having completed the lesson. This is essential in lessons
where there is no actual 'end'. eg. news, talkomatic,
moonwar, dogfight, and any other lesson that might be
listed in an index..

        'lesson incomplete' does the opposite..
read up on it in New Systems Features..

and please start using it..

Note too that "end lesson" will set the lesson-completed
condition, too, so that if the student presses something
other than NEXT he will still get credit for the lesson
when he does finally leave. (It is still true that
!end lesson" will take the student out of the lesson if
he presses NEXT.)

checking to see if the person is registered in that course

it does save one disk access.

A suggestion, then:
It would require four bits per record in the course
directory to store user type. Not only could personal
notes then check to see if a person is an author, but
also this feature would make the proposed addition to
the "readr" command more useful: When the readr command
is able to read the course directory to make a roster of
names, one could make a roster consisting solely of
student names, and eliminate authors and instructors.

In order to know how important the extra disk acess would
be, assuming that the information on user type doesn't get
moved or duplicated, it would be interesting to know how
many notes get written per day and how many disk access
per day are already done. I do not advocate degrading
response time... and several 'you will hardly notice
this extra check' scattered thruought the system will
be noticed, but not making this check will cause the
note sender to type another note, consuming other system
resources while he does...

---------- response 7

          I sincerely doubt that the second disk access is
worth the effort and the overhead. How many times have you
tried to send a note to a student and did not realize that
he was a student? Unless someone can convinve me that this
happens an appreciable amount of times, the procedure will
remain the same.

4-second improvement to the X-searcher code:
have it calc something into n1 when the author
exits it.
For different options it could be different:
for "Read lesson list" it could be the name
of the lesson with the list, for "Type lesson
list" it could be the name of the first lesson
in the list.
In this way, a person forgetting the location
of a unit or reference and typing "X" to find
it wouldn't have to type the name of the lesson
again to get back into it.

X-search option so that the user can return to the lesson
he last edited without having to re-type the lesson name.
I think this is less confusing to the user than Warner's
suggestion, and is also more consistant with other options
available from the author mode page.

Fumento, that doesn't solve it; I just tried. The
X-search program may not zero n1, but apparently the
editor does, because after coming out of X-search,
pressing next on the Author Mode page does nothing.
(Sequence of events I used to test this: went into
a lesson (to the block data page), pressed back, X,
went through a few pages of X-search, then pressed stop1;
at this point, next key by itself was ignored.)

   No, the point is that LAB1 may NOT condense a lesson

function from the STOP1...LAB1 actually functions just as
if you had typed the lesson name on the AUTHOR MODE
display and pressed DATA to see it as a student.
...perhaps the process could be stopped in the case
where the lesson is NOT currently available (and a 
condense is required)--but this may or may not be
a simple change (and for what it is worth, does not
correspond to what happens from the AUTHOR MODE display).

Alan, I think what they're saying is that if you press

condense even if all condense flags are off; it doesn't
look at them before going to the condense queue. They
want LAB1 to work the same as DATA, so......?

slightly differently from DATA.

Also, another point is...
Suppose you enter a lesson which is condensed. You press P
and change all the condense flags from " " to "-".
Now, if you condense the lesson by pressing STOP1, you will
remove the lesson from ECS and replace it by the newly
condensed version -- empty except for the 47 words the
system attaches to all lessons.
But suppose you want to look at the lesson as it was,
without recondensing? Then LAB1 does the trick at least
part of the time.

Re. the announced new editor changes:?
1) Thank you for the advanced warning. It is appreciated.?
2) I'd like to ask that you leave the number of lines
displayed by pressing SPACE at the present 12. I have
found this to be one (perhaps unintentional) advantage of
the present 5 versus the old 8 lines. The reason is that
a lot of displays have at least a line or two which are so
long they take two screen lines to display; since two
space presses display 29 lines, and ? then takes me to
the next page, I can review whole pages without losing a
line or two at the bottom. This is a real advantage!?

I see the point, Gary; if every n-part file is now going

I haven't seen the support for the new disk system.
I guess I assumed that a 14-block file would still
I thought the 7 block files would bedisplay one block data page with blocks a-n. Will such
a file instead display two block data pages, each listing
only blocks a-g? If so, could someone explain why?
The present 14 blocks per page is convenient; it is always
a nuisance to have to move through block data pages to
the block you want, so it would seem that the more blocks
that are displayed per page the more convenient the block
selection would be for the user.

The reason for the change is to allow 7-block mini-lessons.
These lessons will be much easier to use, since they will
allow you to condense small lessons without going to all

while i agreed with prof friedman at first (about displaying

would take an extra keypress to access certain blox, that is
preferable to the longer display time of a 14-blok page --
with the time (¬+ processing) saved with the shorter display,
one might even get autobroken less ¬+ sneak in a few presses
to make up for the extra -part- choices (this may be wildly

 I still like the 14 block listing. If a lesson
is not an odd number part lesson,I don't think
that the lesson should be displayed any differently
than it is now. If it is an odd part lesson, then
display only the last part in the new 7-block format.
It would eliminate all the hassle of getting to part
18 of a lesson. I like to see a lot of block names
at a time.

        Though the 'SHIFT-0' idea is an interesting one,
it still doesnt solve problems to make things consistent
with note responses and personal notes.
        I'm not sure what will happen with displaying
parts on the page. A long time ago it was thought that
we would display only one part (7 blocks) at a time to
begin with, then change if nescessary after all the other
problems of 7 block parts are worked out.

        Remember, with 7 block parts it is possible to
show 3 parts on a single page! That might even be more
desirable than the present scheme of only showing 14 at
once.

        Thanks for the response, Kim.
        One method of dealing with the consistency problems
(vis a vis notes ¬+ pnotes) would be to use the same conven-
tion in pnotes, as Judy suggested, and in notes to have
the first numerical entry be direct and any successive ones
additive. Actually, of course, this would leave notes
just the way it is now, except that the Shift-3 type entries
would also work, as well as the regular numerals, and
one "leaping" keypress would suffice about 93: of the time.

   The only change that (we hope) a user will see is
that a current one part lesson in the new mode will
say "Part 1 of 2" and show only the 1st 7 blocks.
Please have just a little patience during this change-over
state--our main goal now is to continue to have a system
that works! Once the conversion is completed and
everything is working, THEN we can entertain possible
changes to various displays, etc. It IS the case that
plotting a 7 block directory display will take less
time; it is also the case that in order for the editor
to work for BOTH the current 14 blocks/part and the new
7 blocks/part during the change-over period that we
cannot make alterations to the editor based upon the
new allocation scheme. The change is being made mainly
because we will increase the total disk space by a 
factor of 13/12.

Re Friedman's point 2):

Why not have the best of both worlds by advancing 5+13+13?
However, if lines spill off the bottom, ? should only
advance by one less than the number of lines displayed.
This shouldn't be too difficult, because there is
already programming to suppress the extra lines that
would otherwise wrap around to the top of the page.
Thus the program must have the necessary variables
already available and set.

   Not so simple at all...actually, all the output for

With regard to 13 vs. 12 lines being displayed, Don, the
point is that we have now seen both ways of doing it:
fill up the screen, to 31 lines; and stop at 29 lines.
Frankel has announced a return to filling up the screen
to 31 lines, and I'm asking him not to. In this case,
it's not a matter of a feature we haven't seen yet.

Often I have to work on lessons that I can inspect but not
change which "use" code which I do change from time to time.
In non-prime time, it's murder to get an old copy of the
"using" lesson out of ecs if you can't do a stop1 condense.
How about some way for inspectors to ask for a recondense
as long as there are no users in a lesson?
...and while I'm asking,
a while back, someone asked, "why can't lesson xxx "use"
blocks which are in lesson xxx?", to which sys replied
(predictably), "why would anyone ever want to do that?".
It would be much simpler to maintain some sort of pseudo-
subroutine library if it were possible to "use" block xyz
of a lesson which contained the necessary "use" commands
for the use of that lesson. (note only one lesson being
"used"... then when it becomes necessary to change something
in the "used" lesson, no need to run down all the users.

As for autopress, I read a note from a sysprog recently

so easy. If this has been termed as "low priority", their
priorities are somewhat different than mine.

This is a real problem, because aside from the effects
it has on authors, students can be discredited an answer

Mr. Petry,

     You seem to misunderstand the situation. The change
is being made to allow more efficient disk space utiliza-
tion.
     Lessons that currently contain 14 blocks will still
contain 14 blocks when the change is made. Furthermore,
the maximum size lesson will be 18 parts, exactly double
the current maximum. In short, the only difference will
be that there will be more disk space available to all,
and hopefully, since they may be shorter, lesson space
will be more readily available.

---------- response 2

  To whom it may concern:

Was any type of study or analysis done on the most
efficient number of blocks to be used for "one" part
lessons? It seems to me that there must be an awful
lot of short lessons( <7 blocks ) for this 7 block
proposal. I do not see how we have doubled the lesson
size. If you have a full 9 part lesson now,that is equal
to 126 blocks( 14?9=126 ), when the change goes into
effect we will have 18 parts but we will still have the
same number of blocks;i.e.,126 ( 18?7=126 ). I can see
where there will be some space savings but I would imagine
that most PLATO lessons are longer than 7 blocks..

This maybe my inexperience cropping up again,so I'm

prepared to accept constructive criticisms......

That's correct. The savings in disk space will be trans-

 There will be much space saved though because many lessons

---------- response 5
  04/18     16.27     k mast       p
        The space saving will be more in terms of the
allocation scheme of the disks. It turns out that more
blocks can be allocated if we use 7 block parts instead
of 14 block parts. Please contact Rick Blomme (blomme of s)
for more information.

---------- response 6
  04/18     17.59     blomme       s

   One quick try at explanation of space gain:
There is room on each cylinder (410 cylinders per pack)
for 91 blocks.
   Currently we allocate 6 14 block spaces per cylinder,
thus using only 84 of those blocks.
   Under the new scheme we will allocate 13 7 block spaces
per cylinder, thus using all 91 of the blocks.
   The gain in space is thus a ratio of 13/12 for the
new way over the old, completely independent of arguments
regarding the usefulness of being able to allocate shorter
files (and without changing the number of blocks available
in currnet lessons at all).

Having read the pevious discussions of the new 7 block
parts, and the new systems feature note on the editor
changes to accomodate them, I, for one do not mind
having to page back and forth thru 2 pages of what is
now a one part lesson. However, it seems inefficient
to do this using the additive number system now used
in p-notes. What happens if I am in part 7 and want
to go to part 4? I have to press '-' 3 times or press
shift'-' and then '3'. Each of these entailing the
extra time of plotting the pages for the other parts
I have to go thru to get where I want to go. The
suggestion of pressing whatever number or shift-number
of the part I want to get to makes the most sense to
me, at least. Why are the proposed changes going into
effect rather than the apparently more efficient
suggestion previously made? Or, isn't it more efficient?

   Please give us some time to be sure everything is just
working at all with the new file scheme before handling of
these details is worked on and an optimum scheme produced.
No "ultimate" commitmetns have been made.
   Going to a particular part after initially entering
a lesson will still require only 1 key press and getting
to any other cannot take more than 2 (SHIFT "-" to get
to 1st block and then the appropriate number). Only
with something like a dataset might troubles arise--
and jumping multiple blocks backwards does seem strange.
   Whether more than just one part should be displayed
at a time and how to skip around in these files will be
more easily argued and the time will be available for
working on such trivia once the major conversion work
is finally done.

With code something like the above, the vast majority of

Is there any reason why you can't display two 7-block
portions on ONE PAGE, like you do now? The 7-b. pieces
would be two separate entities, but could be displayed

Initially we will show 1 part on a page ONLY because we
have much more important things to worry about. Once we are
certain that everything else is working, we will then have
time to discuss how many parts will be shown on one page,
NOTE: It is possible to show either 1,2,3,4 parts on one
page! (Not just 1 or 2) We do consider this a detail of
the much larger problem of just getting the 7 block part

  How about after you get everything working right,
giving the author a choice of format of the page.
Let the individual choose whether he wants 1,2,3,or4
segments of 7 shown on a page.
  Another thought...Say that from the first block pressing
the shift key along with a number adds ten to the number
like suggested before...and if one is in another block
hitting a number could advance you so many blocks like
suggested...now how about if in other than the 1st block,
having a shifted number move one back that many blocks.
For example if you are in block 6, hitting shift-4 will
move you back to block 2.

A strange thing has been happening in the editor lately.
(This also occurred to another person in the room or I
might have thought my eyes wre playing tricks.) Anyway,
I was testing out my lesson and decided that a line of
code needed chaging. So, I STOP1ed out of the lesson and
pressed NEXT to edit (since I already had the change code
typed in). BUT, to my surprise, I entered under INSPECT
ONLY! I then hit BACK to get out of there, sensing something
might be wrong. But then having a feeling that it might have
just been an optical illusion, I hit NEXT again entered my
lesson...this time without the INSPECT ONLY!!!! Then I tried
to go into block n of the lesson and I saw the n plot at
about 2715(gross grid- I assume that is where the arrow for
block editing is) and the screen just sat there for about

recapitulate  todays events, when celia of pso said (and
I quote) "how'd I get in inspect only?" So jumping on this
chance to prove my sanity, I asked her to go into block n
of her lesson. To both our surprises, the same thing which
happened to me, happened to her! but the second time she
tried to get into block n, it let her. Then I asked her to
NEXT. This brought her back into her lesson. But she was
NOT under inspect only as she was last time. No codes were

Got an even better one:

I was in the insert mode page, finished a line, pressed

f***ing arrow moved down a line as if I pressed -NEXT-.
I then said to others in the room "watch this", knowing
full well PLATO will never duplicate an error when you
want to show somebody. However I was fooled. The -BACK-

3 lines. What is with this magic machine today?

As it currently stands, an instructor does NOT have to know
the change code of the course his own record is registered
in, but does have to know the change code of any other
course he may need access to, EVEN IF THE CHANGE CODES
ARE THE SAME.

It would solve one of our problems if an instructor were
allowed access to any course for which he has the change
code OR which has the same change code as the course for
which he is an instructor. We either have to give out the
codes or create an instructor signon in each course; neither
alternative is appealing.

Create the instructor record, then sign in under that

Good idea, Rob. We use this technique for training new
authors. They have a lesson space to work in for which
the change code is the same as the inspect codes for the
other lessons. Upon creating his author record, we sign
in on it and -Shift-Data- from the author mode page and
choose option 's'...enter security code. He then has re-
corded for all time the inspect code for the course file
and all lesson files (so that he may look but not change)
and the change code for the 'experimental' lesson file
where he may blunder around to his heart's content.

Please do not change it so that an instructor can edit any

Our CS105 TAs each have a course for his students. All 6

First, I also use the system of several courses with the

from course to course, but each instructor has a record only
in his course.?
Second, I would be opposed to the change suggested in the
original note. I don't see the need for an instructor to
access more than one course (unless it is the person in
charge of a large course--in which case, he, or she, should
be trustworthy enough to be trusted with the code).

each class has a different course, but to m ke it easy
on the people who control the course, the three codes
are the same.. To edit each course the (poor) teacher
has to sign out and then in again.. This greatens the

You missed the point entirely... A deletion of a routed
student will cause havoc with most routers. Consequently
routed students should never be stop1 deleted ( at least
I can not think of any reason for it ). If one must make
that drastic a change, it is assumed that your project 
director can take care of getting the students out.
      I for one would fear for my life if I ever
attempted to delete students from a lesson, and I assume

Well, that all depends on your mode of operation. In
the CS case, students have assigned lessons, and an author
who recondensed one of these would be most unpopular with
the staff (as well as with the students).?
But we also allow the students to browse, and sometimes an
author must delete a browsing student to work on his lesson.
It would be kind of nice to be able to give him a sensible
message. However, I would also consider this to be pretty
low priority.

I believe there have been a few notes lately complaining

A recent RAND publication, S.M. Johnson's "Certain Number- 
Theoretic Questions in Access Control" (R-1494, Jan.,1974),
discusses schema to generate passwords to an information
system such as PLATO in which privacy if not security is
of critical concern re access of files, the system itself,
and so on. Beyond the number-theoretic aapects of the
paper, though, is this idea: should a system like PLATO
auto-generate new passwords for the users (at least for the
authors) such that each day (or whatever period is desired)
the user is automatically provided with a new password which
can not be altered by him/her?
Of course, this means that an author user would have to
write down each new password that s/he is assigned, but for
those extremely concerned about Access-control, that is a 
small price to pay. (CONTD)

---------- response 1
  04/21     09.48     don emerick       mtc

On the other hand, such a facility means that if the
VULTURES do get your password, you will immediately become
informed of the fact because you will not be able to signin
under the last previous password you were given.

     Since not all of us are so "concerned" about security,
perhaps this could be made an option along with the _five_
talk options with appropriate emendations of logic to
prevent the VULTURE from altering the password. That is,
the option would only turn off the auto-generator...never
allowing the author to select his/her own password. Thus,
Vultures would always leave a conspicuous gap in the
signon record of the victimized author!

Anyone got a better idea besides Ford?

---------- response 2
  04/21     10.00     md       csa
One of the nice features of PLATO's security is that it
allows a person to select his own password. If used
properly a person can ¬ choose a password so scambled or
so esoteric that even if a 'vulture' sees the password
typed in he won't be able to remember it by the time that
it is safe to try out his 'vultured' code.

One easy method of increasing external security could
be implemented by changing the ECS user listing so
that they only listed site-station, user type and ecs
usage. Thus even if a 'vulture' saw the password, he would
have trouble finding out who it belongs to.

Since when has Ford had any good ideas??
As regards the password feature, I don't believe such
Draconian measures are necessary. And even if they were,
they could be simulated easily by an author who simply
changes his password every time he enters! And if the
vultures can follow an author's typing of his own password,
surely they can find a way to grab it when the author makes
a note of it after it has been changed!?
I do not believe changing the E-list scheme will help any,
either, since any vulture who watches an author type his
password will simply watch him type his name and course!?
(By the way, a most effective password to defeat vultures
is your name spelled with one keyboard letter changed,
i.e. "sikas" for me. (No, that's not it.) The vulture
sees what he expects to see, and cannot get in by typing
what he _thinks_ he saw.

  Previous discussions of this problem indicate that the
present situation is NOT satisfactory to at least some of
the authors in the user groups. The NICE feature of a 
system option is that THE VULTURE MUST LEAVE A TRAIL under
the outlined proposal and that the trail is not dependent
on the authors's remembering that someone might be playing
with his/her signon (ie, remembering to check records of
on system signons). Moreover, those who dislike changing
their passwords all the time can turn the option off.

One minor problem with the auto-password scheme. Nowhere
was it mentioned that the user ever finds out what his new
password is.

Assuming that the user's next passsword will be displayed

new pasword off of the panel than to watch the person type
it in?

It sure is...
   Any system where password is given to user and then user
must enter it back is less secure (2 points of entry) than
one where user selects own password (1 point of entry).

   Absolute security demands total contron of environment.
(This includes carrying a cloth to cover your hands when
you type if you are that paranoid about "vultures").

  Why not have a feature in general notes that would
allow the writer of a note to specify that he wants
to continue his note with responses, and then set a
flag preventing others from responding to the note until
the writer of the note specifys that he has finished
the continuations.

Except that it would then allow someone to write a note

inhibiter to make it work right.

This feature is not really necessary in a small notes file.

Every user has an input buffer, so it is often possible

receiving outputs. However, if you are computationally
bound, keys may be lost. They come in but are ignored
because there is not CPU time available to deal with them.

(1) A change is coming soon--hopefully the final loose

(2)  The change will NOT
    a) require any special action by any user

(3)  The basic visible indication of the change will be that
    when starting to edit a current 1 part (14 block) lesson
    you will see "part 1 of 2" and the 1st 7 blocks will be
    shown. (Please save arguments regarding format of
    displays, etc. until after the initial conversion is

(5) Because not all of the disk space that is actually

    the new way will actually give us more usable space
    on every disk pack...the ratio of disk space available
    is 13:12 for the new way over the old.
(6)  We currently have no more space to add additional
    codewords and other important lesson associated
    information; during this change-over we will also make
    the changes necessary so that such space will be
    available. Again: no changes to any lessons are
    required by anyone in order for this to be accomplished.
(7)   This has unfortunately taken much longer than expected
    and a great deal of speculation and mis-information
    seems to have been propagated. Please be patient, this
    will be completed soon; it will be virtually invisible
    to everyone and simply provide us more disk space.

In any case the point was not to smooth out displays but

        If you wish to specify a common of N blocks, you
may do this by simply indicating N?322 words. Also, a
rough approximation of your desired length may be specified.
Since an entire block must be allocated, any request from
1-322 words will yeild a 1 block common, 323-644 will yeild
a 2 block common, etc. Therefore, using 300 words/block as
a rough estimate, will yeild the correct number of common
blocks if the desired number of blocks is less than 15.

In light of the fact that only full blocks of common

imply partial blocks of common can exist.

One small suggestion:
I can't see anyone requesting a 15-or-less-word common,
so can the common creator accept lengths of 14 or less
as _blocks_ rather than words?
Perhaps a message might be instituted saying
"Press NEXT to create a 14-block common
       LAB to create a 14-word common"

Silas, you can request 25 blocks of common......

---------- response 9
  04/22     20.35     blomme       s

   It is possible that the size of a block may change
at some future date. Numerous "block size" dependent
things must be worked on before such a change will be
really possible. Since commons are handled as totalities
(the entire common being brought into ecs at one time),
there are no "optimizations" that users can make based
upon knowledge of block size. Of course, you may not
want to take up more than a certain number of blocks,
but that is a somewhat different issue. At any rate,
we certainly don't want to introduce any MORE places
where a 322 word size is assumed for a block. The
addition of information giving the current "conversion
factor" between blocks and words is a possibility.

There is another possibility which does happen very oc-
casionally:

When you edit a lesson or course, that file is "attached"
to your station, and subsequently "detached" when you are
finished working in it. Sometimes (but VERY rarely), an
error causes the file to remain attached, even after the
person who was editing it has signed off the terminal!

When a file cannot be attached because someone else has
already attached it, it checks to see who is at the station
the file is attached to -- so if someone else signs on at
that terminal, he will be listed as editing the lesson/
course...

Lesson 'X': Why may one enter a lesson with a blank or open
inspect code and look around, but not be allowed to search
the same lesson w/X less (w/o the security code, that is).
Unless there are some overriding reasons for this state of
affairs I think it would be a real convenience to be allowed
to use lesson 'X' for lessons w/open inspect codes.

---------- response 1
  04/22     10.16     jim g       reading

The reason given previously was that is a matter of
resource allocation. The X search program obviously has to
do a large number of disc accesses.

---------- response 2
  04/22     11.25     al       mfl

As explained to me, the X search lesson attaches the lesson
to the person doing the search and therefore doesn't allow
the owner to edit his lesson.

---------- response 3
  04/22     14.07     fumento       p

        System policy for the X-search option is similar
to that of requesting printouts.

        A lesson is only attached when it contains a leslist
or source block containing the names of the lessons to be
searched (when options b and d are used).

Yesterday, I added a feature to our course note file which
would be nice to have in 'notes'. It allows a reader
to go backwards from a response to the previous base note
rather than to the base note to which the responses were
written. This is especially nice for someone like me
who reads notes backwards chronologically. It also
saves a disk access.

Not exactly high priority but it was simple to do.

a couple of days ago i timed my watch to plato
figuring it would be accurate source.

now it turns out that the time is roughly
thirty seconds off. i doubt that it is my

calibrated.
my question is : how accurate is plato with
its time over the long run (weekly) and how
do you set it.

---------- response 1

        The actual TIME that it is is determined by a
wall clock at the time of loading! This is hardly accurate,
and is just a good indication of what time it actually
is. The actual accuracy of the pulses that trigger seconds
to be ticked off is something that you will have to
determine yourself... or ask the engineers...

  04/23     18.58     steve       cornell

     I suggest you find another source for accurate time.
The system time is set by the operator looking at a wall
clock and entering the time that it reads. You can see
how this might not be accurate to the millisecond.
     Until they implement some better way, call the
National Bureau of Standards at (303) 499-7111.
Unfortunately, this number is in Boulder, Colorado; you
might not want to call too often. Another source is the
tone you sometime hear on network TV shows on the hour.
Or, call a local TV or radio stations.

---------- response 3

The operator doesn't type in the time the clock says;
he types in some time which often has something to do
with the time on the wall (i.e., it is not very accurate
at all!). Soon, however, we will be connecting up a
new device built here to automatically enter the time
and date, so not only will it be more accurate, but has
a good chance of being reasonable, too.

If you really want to get accurate time, several radio/

        It might worth noting that even the new clock,
the one Dave Frankle described, might not be all that
accurate. Due to fluxuations in voltage, and there is
always some, the clock can be thrown off by about .01
of a second, and this could build up after a while
so that the clock would not be too accurate, but it will
be a lot better than the one they have now.....

Having an accurate clock, I am sorry to say, is
only half the battle. Many times, if/when the
system goes down during prime-time,
we are rushing to minimize the down time.
Therefore, we often do not have the opportunity
to enter the time to within +=?- 2 or 3 minutes.

The engineers have talked about hardwiring a 
clock to the computer, but I am afraid that we
will have to make due till then.

if you are closer to Canada than you are to Boulder,

"time-standard" counterpart to WWV. i think one

   For goodness sake! You people all seem to think
that ENTERING a very accurate time will mean that the
time thereafter will be super accurate! The time (after
initial entry) is updated via a computer hardware "clock"
that increments every microsecond and is a 12 bit entity:
i.e., turns over every 4.096 ms) While quite accurate,
this update scheme is nowhere near perfect.
    Having an automatic time enterer would be valuable
mainly as a time saver and a means of avoiding the
occasional entry mistake... having the clock reflect the
time correct to the nearest minute seems precise enough.
(If someone can illustrate a pedogogical reason for
accuracy to the second or millisecond, I'm sure there
are many people who would be interested to know about it!)

Voltage swings do indeed vary the time in digital clocks.
Most digital clocks (electronic) use either a crystal or
digital integrated circut for the base frequency. Both
devices are voltage sensitive.

Digital clocks of the variety now available in consumer
stores obtain their time base from your good old rotating
reference source: The Power Company's generator... they
do allow it to slow down a little during peak load, and
then they run fast at night, so that over the entire day
you get exactly enough cycles so that all clocks are right.

As for a way to set your quartz watches, why not call
175-9-228-8000, which is Illinois Bell's time number in
Chicago... its sync'ed to WWV, and all you need is a
Tie-line-accessing university telephone.

If they (digital clocks) use a Schmidt trigger connected
to the power line and have their low dc voltage supplied
by a well designed (regulated) power supply, my comment
holds. Since this arrangement should be much cheaper
than a crystal controlled clock, I would be surprised
if it was not more universal.

  As to WWV: there are several frequencies on which it
broadcasts, one of which can usually be recieved at any
time. They are : 2.5, 5, 10, 15 (?-I think), and 25 MHz.
Also, there is the Canadian station CHU which broadcasts
on 7.33 MHz which can almost always be recieved here in
the midwest. (A note about the WWV freqs: the lower
frequencies can be recieved best at night, with the
middle-to-high freqs being the best bet during the day)

---------- response 16
  04/24     23.58     eric       cornell

CHU freqs are 3.335 MHz and 7.335 MHz.
WWV freqs are 2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0, and 25.0 MHz.
        probably 2.5 for night and 10 for day would be best
        for those in illinois.
WWVH freqs are 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, and 20.0 MHz broadcast from
         Hawaii.
WWVL freq is 60 kiloHertz.
WWVB freq is 20 kiloHertz.
The last two are very accurate (better than a millisecond)
because the radio signal does not use the ionosphere to
propagate itself and is not subject to its fluctuations.
There is some phase delay in these stations which occurs
slowly thru the day (a 12 hour cycle if you plot it).
The shortwave stations (first 3 in the list) are probably
good to within a few hundred millisecs.

        Instructors should now be able to read/write
Personal Notes again. The error was a side affect of
recent changes to the way instructor were handled on
the system.

        I've also found and fixed one source of the
recent rash of 'Recovery Errors' that have plaqued us. It
may take a few days for all the indivual directories
to get fixed.....and it may have not been the only source
of the error. Please keep reporting these errors, I do
want to get all this corrected.

       My apologies to everyone for these errors,
especially to those in course 'matha', who seemed to
have the most trouble. (They send and receive over 10:

   Does anyone know how the "size" command clac's ?
As to say rather, if I have two objects one drawn in size
.9 and the other was drawn in size 0. In reducing both
drawings to allow for more text at the bottom of the page
I had to size the drawings (which are in rdraw) to do this.
  One drawing (.9) was reduced to .6, and the other was
reduced to size .7 (this I figured would keep it the same
and wouldn't mess up the drawing..
   HOWEVER much to my surprise the drawings didn't size down
right..the .7 drawing was larger than the .6 size......
    Can anyone comment on this?

---------- response 1
  04/24     09.00     friedman       csa

Well....my first reaction is, did you type in what you

say was) larger than the .6 size drawing.

---------- response 2
  04/24     09.02     lo francis       mtc

size=0 is a special case---it is equivalent (in the case
of rdraws) to size 1. For text, size 0 and size 1 are the
same size, but one is drawn with line segments one, with
plotted characters. To acheive the same size with both
-rdraw-s they should both be .6 (or .7).

---------- response 3

If I interpret your question correctly, you should either

As a point of general interest: uiuc dept. of riv is in the
process of putting a lesson on as part of its Plato
curriculum which is essentially training for the 3rd phone
w/broadcast endorsement (element 9). The lesson should be
completed within the next couple of months as it is to be
used in the fall. SIU has a lesson dealing w/the 2nd class
license, but this is a little beyond the needs of the
average 'transmitter babysitter'. The lesson is 'siu9'.

     Please note that you need elements 1 and 2 for the
third, _and_ element 9 if you want the broadcast endorsement.
The third class exam is incredibly trivial; the hardest
part is getting to an FCC office within the 15 minutes

as I already have a 1st class commerical, extra class
amateur, etc, etc.

        However, students here have recently taken their
tests for element 9 (bdcst endorsement) and discovered
to their dismay that the test has been made considerably
more difficult in recent weeks than the ameco book shows.

None of you raise the philosophical question of whether
there is, in fact, any such thing as "time", or the lesser-
order question of "accuracy" in semi-consciously determined
constructs. While you're chuckling, this is a real question
with a great deal of material written on it. But I suppose
we will all go on pretending that there is such a thing as
"time" no matter what metaphysicians might say....

---------- response 6
  04/25     18.41     mike b       cornell
Whatever metaphysicians might say, most users of
PLATO are probably empiricists, if not scientists, engineers
or other rational thinkers. To us, time is a measureable
property of the universe; specifically it is the property
of an event or entity which we call "duration." As such
a quantity, it is as real to us a mass--and anyone who does
not believe in mass should try the simple experiment of
dropping a rock on their feet on a high-gravity planetary
body. Many are confused by the relatively recent discover-
ies of physics, which seem to indictate that the measured
time of an event, or duration of a body, are not absolute
quantities. But the relativity of time is just the same as
the relativity of other fundemental properites, such as
mass and velocity. Thus, I think the existene of time as
a measureable quatity should not be doubted. --M- ike.=====?B

In general, your exhortation is very well taken. In this
case, it is not that Marty screwed up and got an announce-

it is the case that he ventured on his own initiative to

how ot use it in stan7, student mode. There is an

I just finished a long programming stint, and so there

room 165 users come over to your office and said "can I use
your phone?. " Of course you can not let them use it for
they allways would be tying up your phone.
        A solution to this is very easy. Why not make
the phone at the east end of the first floor hall be
able to make phone calls to other than just university
numbers? This would not only be inexpensive but of great
use to the thousands of users of room 165. Something like
this has been needed for a long time. One thing that

  Well....Ma Bell wasn't happy about that...seems that
too many folks were using the free phones instead of the
pay phones...after several months, the University acquiesed
to pressure from Ma Bell and agreed to the restriction of
the Union phones to just internal numbers.
  For a long time there were (still are?) apologetic notices
above the newly restricted phones explaining that it was
against Bell tariffs to have "free" phones in public places.

The pay phone is the best idea presented in this whole

thing necessary.

Also, a sign, plainly visible, perhaps with large RED
letters should be posted in 166 saying: "This phone for
operators only!". It might cut down on the number of
requests anyway. And the operator on duty can always just
point to the sign if people insist on asking.

   The statements made by glass regarding warnings given
and the time involved are both false.
   However, again: if there  IS someplace that a backout
procedure does not save info (assuming no action by a user
with respect to warnings), we do not know of it currently
(other than personal note writing) and welcome such info.
   The actual time that system work was in progress is
DOCUMENTED in the system log because of the nature of
the work being done--it shows that this interval was
20 minutes (during which people could sneak onto system).
Before this work started, a 5 minute warning was given,
then a standard 1 minute countdown backout done. The
message said "system off for 5 min" (it was 20 instead).
When system work was completed, an "instant aneous"
backout was done (rather than just killing the system) to
preserve the work of anyone who had ignored the warning
and snuck back on the system.

       The statements made by myself are both quite

sitting next to me told me that he had just lost 45
minutes of work. "...during which people could sneak onto
system." As far as the users and the operator knew that I
talked to that night, the system was 'up'. (95 users on).
then all of a sudden some minutes later came the message at
the top of the page "system going down now (finially) " or
words very close to those. Then 5 seconds later, bamn,
down went the system and all of this kid's work.

   I certainly hope that my patient and careful explanations
are sufficient to convince those users not present and
not involved in this incident that the system staff is
indeed greatly concerned with providing every possible
protection and warning for users and do so to the best
of human ability. I trust also that the nature of the
situation has been clearly explained and that the correct
determinations as to the actual sequence of events, their
duration, and the intent of the systems staff can be made
by all.
   Although the request for info regarding any place
that a backout COULD miss updating was ignored in favor
of continued polemics, we HAVE found out about a way that a
user of service could manage to lose work (see later general
note on topic) and this will be corrected immediately.

You must be kidding blomme, unless you think that

Your request for info regarding the place where the

I wrote a reply saying that it was a problem with service.
Remember this happened to the person sitting next to me

With the following sort of code...
arrow   1010
long    2
answer  30
write   matched
no
...when will a response of 30 be judged no?

After nearly an hour of trying to run down the reason, it
turned out to be because of a -specs allwords- about
eight blocks before.
I was aware that "allwords" is in effect until the next
-specs- command is encountered in the _condensor_, and it is
true that specs for other arrows were in joined units,
so that even though there were probably 2 dozen arrows
between the "allwords" and the above code, the "allwords"
was still in effect....
BUT...should that have made the tag of "30" in the answer
command unmatchable? If it's an unavoidable adjunct of the
"allwords" option, it should be specifically documented.

---------- response 1

If you ask for the "allwords" option in lesson aids...you
will find that there is a note warning you about what
happened.

There are several other commands that have the same
potential danger in their use...and we are trying to
figure out a way to improve the situation. The main
problem is that condensing is a linear process white
executing is very non-linear.

---------- response 2

   I admit bewilderment at BOTH the preceding remarks.
(1) I have tried the exact code (with interspersed
   specs allwords, of course) given in the example and
   was able to get 30 judged correct--other tests with
   other entries also seemed to work. So: EXACTLY what
   was the code that produced an unmatchable answer?
   (I am willing to believe that there indeed could be
   some obscure difficulty in this area, by the way).
(2) The original note complained but mildly about the
   "carry-over" effects of the allwords tag but seemed
   mainly directed at the fact that the answer simply
   couldn't be matched with allwords specified. Either
   Tenczar missed the point or I have missed some
   description somewhere in aids saying something about
   cases where allwords does not work (aids DOES mention
   the "carry-over" effect, of course).

---------- response 3
  04/28     09.49     kimble       ustaf

Right...I was not really complaining about the fact that
-specs allwords- remains in effect until the condensor
encounters another -specs- command. The problem is with
the answer command acting strangely.

There wasn't room in the original note for all the code
involved...I have left you a personal note, Rick, that
directs you to some sample code that illustrates the
problam. It is repeatable.

---------- response 5
  04/28     19.44     blomme       s

   Yes, I understand now...everybody is right (but me)!
To explain:
   The problem is that in the EXECUTION code there was
NOT a specs allowords in effect at the arrow BUT because
of another preceding (condense-wise) specs allwords
directive, the answers had all been condensed as if
it WERE in effect. The "allwords" treatment of numbers
differs from the regular treatment--the representation
of a number under "allowords" is as a character string
rather than simply as a number in the normal case.
Thus, if condense and execution time specs re allwords
differ at an arrow, then any answers that contain numbers
cannot be matched! If a specs allwords had been placed
after the arrow, then the answer 30 could have been
matched (as a character string.); if a specs (blank) were
used, the condensor would have stopped "allwording" and
the number would have matched (as a number!)

No, not exactly. The C search might be already loaded with
a different search item. That shouldn't affect the option
I am suggesting. One could hide a C*mark like search
permanently under the -next1- key so that one could return
to the *marker line at any time, even when you are already
in the block and independent of any item loaded into the
real C search. It would automatically take you to the
line if you enter the block with a -next1-. If there is
no *marker comment in the block then it would put you at

john... i am confused...
whether of not there is a "*marker" line in the block,
will the entire block have to be read through
to find a potential "marker"?
if so won't this make the editor very slow?
most times the screen won't plot fast enough...i sure
don't want to have to wait while each line is searched
on the off-chance that the "C" command should have its
associated word changed.
but if this problem can be overcome then it would be
good feature....

Oh, boy...
You don't know it (maybe), but you have just stumbled
into the most common problem of PLATO. These little
folks (usually referred to as vultures,little mamzers,etc.)
have to be periodically chased off the system in order
to allow authors to work. If you get real trouble
with one, call the operator using "alert" or at
333-2375.
?P.S. I am not at CERL, but the problem is universal.

Quite a few of them have legitimate signons in order to
learn to program and/or just become exposed to a different
sort of learning environment. If you don't like their
presence or the pedagogical rationale, I suggest you take
it up with the projects who are funding such activities.

I don't mind the legimate ones, just the ones that

   Giggling, screaming and fighting are bad if they interfere
with your work. If this is the case, the person
doing the giggling screaming and/or fighting should be
reported whether or he/she is a kid or a 55 year old
professor. (lesson -alert- is quite adequate)
   "Kids" are an important part of the PLATO community
whether they are playing games or doing authoring for
some project, The experience they are gaining from
this exposure to computation will be invaluable to them
later on whether it is -dogfight- or -edit-.
   Keep in mind that the ones that are bothering people
will benifit from learning that they have responsiblities
to the other users. They will learn it more effectively
with positive reenforcement of good behavior if you have
the time to spare on it.

  Read this year's Engineering Open House publication

being speaking for him. It is something to the effect
of what I said in my original note. Give them the
resources, the motivation and the correct reenforcement
and you have an evolutionary learning process which is
extreamly viable.
   -edit- is better for this for some personalities.
   Some games are extreamly powerful motivational tools
which have brought a large precentage of the functional
programming efforts on the system.
  Contact with those should be encouraged to the point
that they interfere wiht those who have already been
motivated by observing other's creativity.

After much research, as far as I know, the machine cannot
be driven at those speeds using present PLATO IV system.
The terminals can be driven much faster than that using
a separate driving computer system (like an attached
PDP11 or micro-processor [upcoming PLATO IV]) The infor-
mation passing etc. is just not fast enough, as is the
(from what I here) pretty inefficient -calc- code...
It would be best to stick witht low cpu usage games that

FILE CONVERSIONS...

I'm sure there will be a number of notes on this topic from
people who are confused about the system file conversion
from 14 block pages to 7 block pages. Allow me to be one
of the first:
        I think there is a screw-up which occurs when con-
densing the converted lessons. I got a condense error on
one of my converted lessons. It told me the error was in
2-g. I looked, could not find it, and condensed again. The
same condense error occurred allegedly in 2-g again. Upon
looking again and not finding it I entered lesson X to look
for it. Lo' and behold! The condense error was occurring
in _3_- g, not 2-g. Has the machinery which gives condense
error messages been confused by the lesson conversion?

I think this was a viable discussion necessary before the
change. The person said that he did not like the 7 block
arrangement and would like it left at 14, not a complaint
about operation at 7 blocks. (such as previous remarks).
A response like:

         "The change to 7 blocks from 14 has
been discussed previously. It has been shown that for
more efficient use of resources, especially cpu time,
the 7 block display will help greately. The 7 block
system also has increased the amount of disk space that
is useable. We are presently trying new methods for
access to the blocks to make the editor more useable."=
would have been a little nicer than "We dont want to

Did I miss something or have I encountered on of PLAT<'S
famous unannounced features?

The limit on condensed code seems to have been increased
(at least on this present version of PLATO). I put several
lessons together and came up with about 11750 words of
condensed code. 1500 words storage and 8050 words of common.

Is this new limit temporary, due to increase still more,
bound for a sudden drop to old levels, or what?

I assume the increase is related to AMS or something like it
or is it something to take everyone's mind off the disk

Lesson binaries________ (code) can only be 8192 words long
(that's 2?^16 Or something close). When a lesson gets
to be 8000 words long in the code, you get a warning.
Commons can be up to 8964 words long (that's 27 blocks
or one 2-part lesson) with comloads, and storage can
be up to 1500 words. This means that in theory you
can run a lesson that is 18656 words long.

That is the way it was, I agree on that. I ran a foul of the

In editting a lesson  i ran over the 8000 word warning limit
and no warning. Being daring I said to myself (after
stop1 condensing twice to make sure) hey neato no message
where did they move it (the message limit to). On cramming
bunches of code into a lesson I condensed it and lo it was
11745 words condensed code. I quickly slapped an 8050 word
common on it and added 1500 words of storage and viola!
(11745+8050+1500=20295 words total)

0/0 is an indeterminate form, so it is technically equal to
anything.
1/0 is an undefined form that is interpreted as being
_greater_ than anything.
These forms will behave exactly as you would expect, un-
less used in conditionals. In a conditional, 1/0=0. In an
explicit compare, however, 1/0>0. Thus

judge  1/0,no,ok,no  $$. judges ok
judge  1/0=0,ok,no   $$  judges no

Aside from this anomaly, the forms behave exactly as one
would expect. If you have any complaints, blame it on

A suggestion for the condensor people to keep them busy
while the editor people debug seven-block lessons,
What about a command called, say, "default", that
would change the the value of "x" that the condensor
puts in whenever it cannot find a unit?
Example, suppose you are testing a lesson which is
unfinished. At the present, any reference to the
unfinished parts goes to "x", which simply leaves
the student floating around in a haze, seeing
"done" units and other garbles. With a "default"
command in place, the student could be taken to a unit
which says
        "I'm sorry, this lesson is not finished.
        Press -NEXT- to go to the index."
(If the default unit does not exist, presumably a
condense error or execution error would result.)
Not high priority, but nice.

---------- response 1
  04/29     20.35     fay       rtv362

I have an alternative suggestion: put one unit in all
lessons on which you are working called "incomp",
then, when coding, write something like:
        unit nextone$$unit under construction
        do . incomp$$unit which presents message.
        *
        *
        *next physical unit

This would take very few lines of code, very little effort,
and would not necessitate the development of a new feature.
The unit names under construction could all be grouped to-
gether in one block named "contruct" or something for ease
in finding them later to put in their proper places.
        Just a thought....

No, no, no, you've got the wrong idea. He wants the
condensor to, when it comes to a unit it can't find,
substitute a real unit name, rather than the x it
substitutes now.

This might really be all screwed up, but:

As I understand the way the condenser works, it doesn't know
when it encounters a non-existant unit name, so it just
says 'Go to (do,jump,join,etc) the address in this table'
which will be filled later with the actual address of
the unit (when it is found). If it is not found, something
is substituted which says to fall through. If this could
instead be replaced with a real unit name, then lessons
with units that aren't found could be tested more
accurately than is now possible.

        Please correct me if I'm wrong, but this concept
appears to be very easy to implement.

        I was just wondering what the criteria for word

I suppose that the specific answer depends on how one writes
the code: but the problem is ageneral one in linguistics:
linguists are very reluctant to answer what seems to be an
innocent and intelligent question---"What is a word ?"
variants include "How many words are there in language X?"
The only answer is "nobody knows." Take "drug store"
"drug-store", "drugstore". All have been used as normal
forms. If there sis a moral, I guuess it might be that
we have to be very careful in determiniing what we will
accept as answers: "exact" could produce all kinds of
trouble in some instances, for example. P.S. Looking in
dictionaries won't always help much, either.....

In the tags of -answer- commands, the author may use only
spaces as his word boundaries. (If I missed some allowable
thing, please tell me, people!) The student may use space,
any of the black keys on the left, any of the shifted number
keys except percent, underline, single quote, and any of
the punctuation keys except double quote.

Thus student responses of "hot-dog", "hot?dog", "hot(dog",
etc. all match the author response of "hot dog"; but
student responses of "hot:dog", "hot_dog", etc. do not.

The student can use as many separators as he wants, e.g.
"hot:::!!::dog". A single backspace by the student is not
taken as a separator.

the following command

instead of producing tabs after the 8th letter, 16th,etc.
produces tabs at===6_ the 6th, 14th, 22nd,etc.
In other words, add 2 to every tabset setting in
order to get the tabs to come out right.

   The tabset command was one of those old quickies
written to get the editor working--we settled for absolute
screen position. The command is quite consistent and
easy to explain--and also rather an atrocity for any
human to have to deal with. Perhaps some day someone
will fix up both the form of the command and its function.
   P.S. I just fixed something concerned with the TAB
key function that fouled things up in strange places
in strange ways...it used to be the case that with the
arrow and tab columns located exactly in the right
relative positions that a space would be entered but
no judgment forced in case of a long 1! If spaces ARE
entered by pressing the TAB key, the proper checks for
forced juding are now made.

Once we get it through our thick skulls that -tabset- sets
_absolute_ screen positions, then it's not so bad to work
with. Since -tabset- remains in effect for the whole
lesson unless "unset", I think that absolute positions are
the only ones that make sense.

This makes the screen vertical, usually eliminating the

   We now understand (as apparently a number of others
have for some time but have just not bothered or managed
to communicate the exact details to us before) ONE way
that people can lose work during a system backout.
   People who enter the service lesson directly rather
than via the SS option in the editor will lose all their
work currently unless they manage to specify a lesson
and block to put the code in before the system backout
occurs.
   This will be changed as soon as possible (we may be
forced simply to rule out entries other than via SS in
the editor) and we apologize for the lost work this
situation has caused some people in the past!

       Suggestions:

1)     An optional vote be taken on each general note to
       deside its fate (life, temporary, death).
       The fate might be descided using some kind of
       confidence interval sceme.

2)     Each note be classified by the author according
       to its purpose or content, for instance; this
       note would be about notes, and voting.
       Unlike the present form, a short _list_ of keywords
       would be kept.

       Then the library option in aids could scan
       the classifications, if the user wished,
       looking for one or more of these keywords.

       Hopefully, this would make notes a better

this happened -- will try to find out. Course directors
should reset these options before adding new students to

I think I have found a bug in the calc compiler.
I have some code that looks like (different but same idea):

doto    i,i?1,n
branch  i<k,1,x
doto    1,j?1,n
calc    array (j)?x
1
This bombs with an array error (j is 0) in one lesson but
refuses to fail in a test unit which uses the identical
code...identical defines, etc.. the problem appears to be
that sometimes the branch from the terminus is to the inner
doto where the index is set/incremented, sometimes to the
first statement following the doto.??
I know about branching to the terminus of a doto.
I know how to fix it to make it work.
The above code probably won't fail.
The real offender has of necessity been "fixed", but I
can/will reproduce the error upon request.

     I have also encountered the same unpredictable

share a single end statement, and have a conditional
branch between the two doto statements.

by using two different end statements. This removes the
ambiguity of which doto ends where.

The way the terminals is built, there are only 126 slots
for built-in characters. When we switched from PLATO III
to PLATO IV, the request went out, "Which of the 'special'
characters do _you_ want on the terminals?"

Then after 50 or so terminals, the built-in characters were
changed again. Suggestions were solicited, but not many
came in. (Satisfied users tend to keep quiet.)

It is not possible to include everything in 126 characters,
but there were indeed some poor choices made. It is dumb
to have ¬n (micro-n) and ¬; (micro-;), since we realize now
that one can be easily made from the other without needing
to occupy a precious built-in slot.

---------- response 5
  05/01     09.50     judy       pso

These characters are "composed":
(They are made by automatic combinations of already
existing built-in characters.)

¬0 and ¬1 (the embed symbols)
           are parentheses ( ) plus backspace <>
¬,        (the delimiter for -writec-)
            is ¬X , backspace, ¬W
c¬c       (the cedilla or 'tail' part)
           is   ¬e lowered by 9 dots
I have requested that ¬q¬e be added as an accent to complement
the ¬x that we have already. ( ¬q + backspace + ¬e)

Suggestions of widely useful "composed" characters are
welcome.
Rules: "composed character" cannot comprise more than
3 or 4 keypresses.  Characters cannot be repositioned
except vertically, and possibily by half-spaces.

Use of the ellipsis (...) to end a sentence has a fairly

speech. Not to mention it's use to indicate a normal pause
in speech, or an interrupted sentence.

I will admit to a certain prejudice, since I use the ellipsis

  They can also be used to indicate a pause in the

finishing the sentence. It also comes from term

Suggestion:

        I have the following suggestion for a new addition
to the PLATO system's already large collection of special
jargon.
        As we all know, TUTOR supports the segmenting of
variables to simulate arrays (actually, they're vectors,
but nobody minds a little cribbing). I'm sure that the
more mathematically inclined members of the PLATO community
have noticed that segments sizes 1,2,3,4,5,6 all create seg-
ments which fit evenly into the CDC machine's 60-bit word.
Now a number of bits handled as a unit of storage is gener-
ally called a "byte," but I belive that, because of their
special property (divisibility into 60) and their small
size, these small bytes should recieve the special name
"nibble." Thus, a byte of up to 6 bits is a nibble.
        Further, as many of us are aware, most byte sizes

over 6 bits leave unuseable bits at the end of the word.
I submit that these unuseable bits be called "crumbs," and
that we say "your 17-bit byte will leave a 9-bit crumb."
Of course, as indicated in the quote, segments of more than
6 bits will remain bytes. Leading the sublime author to
the realization that nibbles are neat, and bytes leave
crumbs.

I like it but reading most any IBM text tels you that such
a term as "nibble" already does exist and means a 4 bit
unit which is half a byte and represented by 1 hexadecimal
digit. I think "crumbs" is very descriptive’ though.

     requiring them to go into the lesson to partial-in

to moor of mfl... I don't like the "use" idea myself very
well, but I believe that I know intimately some of the
_least_ ?’naturally talented?’ programmers around. I am
constantly amazed at what they CAN do and ARE doing.

It sounds as if we are going to need a DATA page for
?’how to run this lesson?’ + a page for ?’author information?’.
A less crowded page would be easier for the author to
understand.

GUESTION: I have lessons where the _placement_ of the -use-
is very important. In the proposed scheme, this does not
seem possible. Where would the -use-d blocks appear?
Putting them at the beginning fouls up the ieu; putting
them at the end fouls up those who -use- define sets.

Judy, I don't think Rick is suggesting removal of the
-use- command; my impression is that he means the command
would be placed wherever you wanted it, as now; it just
would not specify the lesson name, but only the block
name. So I don't think your problem will arise (I hope).

---------- response 11

I'm sure this has been considered, but why not have both.

If the -use- lesson is designated on the lesson data page
it would be the lesson -use-d from, but if the -use- lesson
is left blank then a two tag -use- command would be allowed
just as it is now.

A two tag -use- different from the -use- lesson setting
would cause a condense error (or alternatively over-ride
the default -use- lesson).

The idea of a default -use- sounds good to me.

   Wow! My "use" remark seems to have generated mis-
conceptions at an incredible rate.
   No, we cannot have both schemes--the purpose is to
make condensing more efficient and also to move another
of the lesson name items to a place where a system change
would be easy. It will also help in checking for "outside"
connections that a lesson has when it is to be "published."
   The ONLY difference would be that all your use commands
would look the same: i.e., specify a block name; and,
rather than specifying the lesson name to be used as
the 1st argument of the 1st use command, it would be
set on the lesson data display.
   P.S. I assume that the lesson data will become two
displays--one of codewords, used lesson, date/time of
last edit, etc. and one of descriptive information on
the author and the purpose of the lesson.

---------- response 13
  05/02     20.36     blomme       s

   One more remark on the used lesson business (while we
have been diverted): we could easily show the name of
any used lesson on the main block display. It seems
to me that this would actually be a help to people trying
to understand strange malfunctions with someone else's
(or even their own!) lesson.
   Further uses for the new 30 words of space:
time of creation
   we should keep both date and time of creation of a file,
   especially considering that one of these days some sort
   of temporary or ?’24 hour?’ file is likely to come into
   being (down you hungry users! probably not for many
   months!)
an additional line (6 words) for lesson description info
    a single line of description information is really
    quite limited...we probably can spare 6 words to
    provide a 2nd line

---------- response 14

        What about using 3 words to store a name and
course of a person responsible for that lesson. It would
then be possible to allow reviewers of lessions to send a
note directly to the author of the lesson. (Or in the
case of some of our transient authors, his superior.)

        Also, as the concept of a group begins to become
established’ perhaps one word could be used for to store
the name of the group with which the lesson is to be
associated. This would be set at time of creation, and
may only be changed by system personnel. It might then
be feasible to allow a few people to edit any lesson
within the group, (without having to have matching
security codes.)

Ah, Kimmy!  Our group could really use a "contact" listing
as well as the author listing.

We have many programmers who come and go every year (some
even graduate!), so we list our lessons under the designers'
names who are responsible for the lesson content.

It would be important that this "contact?’ name be included
somehow in catalog, since this is the person that is to be
contacted.

   Judy: the advantage of an edit micro would be to have
the micro automatically loaded each time you enter the
editor (over-ridden by a micro set immediately before?).
The way it is now, each time you condense your lesson

any micro you want to be using. I am VERY much in favor
of the automicro word!

to judge an answer right or wrong within a certain area,

'Ntries'. Although this is also low on priorities  i think

  05/01     23.32     michael       english

Many lessons now contain various security provisions based
on name, course, user type, or password routines. In order
to standardize some of these uses, and in recognition of the
fact that name and course checks will be a hindrance to the
concept of a "published" lesson, I think the following com-
mand would prove extremely useful:

   at     someplace                 $$ XXXXs echoed here
   access condeword1,codeword2,codeword3
  <access condition,codeword1,codeword2,codeword3>

This command on being encountered would invoke a system
security routine <if and only if the condition in the first
argument were true>. Once invoked, the person would type in
a word; the system variable *secure* would be set to equal
the index position of the codeword matched, or to negative
one if no match were made.

How about an example, Gary?

Many lessons are restricted for "this site only" or
"not prime time". As we grow to a more library-like
concept, it would seem that these restrictions would not
be appropriate for "published" lessons.

As for data-keeping lessons, should they BE "published"?

¬[ And please don't name it "access". I have gray hairs

---------- response 2
  05/02     10.12     michael       english

Examples:

1) Editors which create or modify databases. Which options
   are open to a given person depends on her/his security
   rating.

2) Complex simulations which require a high degree of
   human maintenance and/or intervention.
3) Programs which display restricted data, such as student
   scores, progress, or personal data.

Such lessons already exist, and invariably exercise entry
control via name and/or course checks. Since ANY file
on PLATO can only be as secure as the password entry page,
I think it would be useful to standarize all security on
the system by allowing the author to use a command which
would essentially duplicate the system security routine.

        I tend to react against more places where a person
has to 'type a security code' in favor of name and/or
course checks. It is then up to the individual on that
'special' list to keep his records secure.

---------- response 4
  05/02     16.16     friedman       csa

I disagree, Kim, Coding the name/security checks into
a data base, or hard-coding into the tutor code, is no
more secure than what Gary is asking for, and can be a
lot less convenient. E.g., in a lesson I'm working on
to format course records to show the data stored in
nr variables by my router, I want to allow access on the
basis of the course security code, typed in at execution
time.

---------- response 5
  05/02     17.59     michael       english

In addition, keeping a 'special' list requires that space
be set aside in common, dataset, or source for this purpose.
Not only is it wasteful of space -- it's even worse if you
have to duplicate the security code routine in several
lessons --, but it means you have to be constantly updating
the list in common dr source as signons come and go. A
better way of implementing the idea might be:

secure at,condition  $$ at=where to plot XXX;
                     $$ skip command if condition false

Then *secure* would be set to 1,2,3 or -1, depending upon
whether entry matched code 1, 2, 3 or none. The 3 codes
would be attached to the lesson along with the change,
inspect, etc. codes, yet would be changeable even after
publication. Thus a violation of security could be
handled without changing the source code.

The following tutor code may be used to make the term key

profit from this. (Have you ever been in a lesson and not
been able to find an arrow so that you could respond to
someone wanting to talk to you? This happens in long ?sequences of text where pauses are used to break it up.)

---------- response 2
  05/02     20.11     jones       mcl

Right you are...

I think in that case that the pause with no tag should be
replaced with 'keys=next' in most if not all cases. This
should be made clear in AIDS, even with a warning against
use of the blank tag pause. With the exception of games
and the CS editors, pause is mostly used for breaking up?long writes, and nowdays mostly with the wrong tag.?
I wonder, is there any case where a black tag pause is
really required? Possibly the blank tag should be ¬) to
the 'keys=all' tag; that is what I thought on my first
through n-1?^th?? reading of the AIDS section in the first
place.

There may be uses of the blank tag pause, and for these
I would propose a special hard to find tag so that most
users would not be likely to use it by accident.

By using  -pause keys=all- you can make the TERM key
active at a pause. If you do not specifically include
a -help-, -back-, -lab- etc, then those keys will just
take you past the pause as if it were a -pause (blank)-.

I still don't see the need for fancy programming in order
to make ?’term" active.

---------- response 6

    Right, Judy, but just remember, as Brand pointed
out, that "unsuccessful" -TERM-s will break through the
-pause-, so you would probably want to catch such an event
and -branch- back to the -pause-.

may also turn out to be useful. if special keys like
-BACK- and -HELP- are not defined to take you anywheres,
they will NOT break thru the pause (only -NEXT- will
break the pause). -TERM- functions normally.

  05/02     18.46     mike b       cornell

     Now They Tell Me Dept.

     It seems that arithmetic operators are illegal in
the tags of word-oriented judging commands, such as -answer-
-wrong-, etc. This has just cost me at least a half-hour of
work, especially since I made the (illogical, I admit) as-
sumption that -specs allwords- would take care of any such
problems.

     It seems to me that there are certain advantages in
allowing arithmetic operators in these commands, such as in
judging literal equations without writing long, involved
-ansv- -wrongv- routines. And I can't see any real reason
for making them illegal, except, perhaps, that it is part
of the punctuation ban in TUTOR judging code. I understood
that this limitation (no punctuation) was to be eliminated;
are we likely to see this soon?

---------- response 1
  05/03     09.25     b sherwood       s

If you are trying to handle algebraic responses, you really
must use those commands which do this: ansv, wrongv,
store, ansu, wrongu, storeu. The word-oriented commands
such as answer and concept will handle simple expressions
(3 cows and 4?5 sheep) but not full-blown arithmetic
expressions (the most complicated thing they handle is
scientific notation, as in 3.52?10^-^4). See the book
"The TUTOR Language" for a detailed discussion of how to
handle algebraic responses. I would be very surprised if
you indeed found you had to use "long involved ansv
and wrongv routines". Often a single ansv will do the
job. Also, see lesson "bas" for some examples of
algebraic judging---and it has no inspect code.

---------- response 2
  05/03     09.27     b sherwood       s

The new "specs allwords" was an attempt to help people
who were specifically NOT looking at nomerical responses
and were having trouble due to the fact that the answer
command does in fact normally do a little bit of numerical
processing. This specs option certainly will not help you
do algebra.

---------- response 3
  05/05     10.53     celia       pso

I think the systems personnel recognize the need to let
authors specify which punctuation marks they want ignored
and which ones they want looked at. I believe, though,
that this can't be implemented for a long time...like years.

  05/02     20.12     curly       iu

   About the leslists.....
From the descriptions of commands in aids I was led to
belive that one could store up to 30 characters in a
leslist position. When I wrote a test unit I found that
one could only store 10 characters. I assume the 30
character format is for some future plans....BUT
I noticed that there were only 321 leslist positions
while the leslist occupys _2_ whole blocks, or 644 words,
or 2 words/position. Now my question is, what is being
done with the 322 unaccounted for words? Are they just
sitting around collecting dust while waiting for future
plans to come through or what? Just want to know where
my lesson is going to...........curly=====-???^?^?^curly

---------- response 1

They are there to insure that when we do change to a new
filing system, your lesson doesn't lie around collecting
dust because it is unuseable because it has a leslist that
is in the wrong format because you didn't want to protect
your lesson with that extra block because of some strange
because.

I was just wondering, since the EDITOR is due for
modifications anyway because of the switch to 7 block parts,
is there any possibility of getting the copy key at the
AUTHOR MODE arrow back (it sure was nice).

Since the problem seemed to be that one could retrieve
lesson names other than ones own, how about only making it
available on backing out from the block page or other places
where it was entered at the arrow to begin with.

I realize that the EDIOR is no simple program, but surely
a flag could be set aside to handle this case.

Computer Simulation Researchers,
        I am interested in knowing what problems were
encountered by those authors who attempted to use PLATO
as a multiple input simulation device and data-gatherer.
Specifically, I am planning a simulation of international
relations as part of on-going research. I need some
8-10 "decision-makers" to represent game participants.
In addition to the telecommunications problem, I need
data storage and analysis of each game played.
        Thus, is PLATO a viable mechanism to accomplish
these tasks or must I settle on the local IBM/370
with local game participants?

It sure would be nice if the editor had a replace and

would then put you into replace mode for line X and
then upon hiting next, would automaticlly goto insert
mode. Im sure many people have had to replace a line,
press back, and then do an insert. It sure would replace
lots of display time and keypresses.

        A friend of mine looking over my shoulder just sug-
gested a better idea.  This would be to have the LAB key
toggle you between insert and replace when in either mode.

        This would be more generally useful since it often
happens that one wants to replace several lines and _then_
go into the insert mode. I have no idea how difficult this
would be to implement (since I have never seen the editor
code), but if possible it would be very much appreciated.

It is done that way if you pressed -NEXT1- on the author

Amen!  All that typing is an unnecessary pain in the neck!

There are "standard" micro tables available here and there.
The current problem is the two-months-or-so-ago change
which made it impossible to copy -charset-s and -micro-
tables without the change code.

Until they get this problem solved, you will either have
to keep doing all that typing, or call somebody who has
the proper codes and ask them to copy it into your lesson.

        I dont think that you will see any effect when
they finally get done testing this round. (Other than
the fact the certain portions of the system may run
20-30: faster!)
        Essentially we are trying to combine the portions
of the system that format output to the terminal and
send output out to the terminal into one 'job' to reduce
overhead.

inordinate amount of time, effort, or interruption to his
chain of thought (i hope) -- with so many PLATO users who
are computer or programming oriented, there is a pool of
interest in observing the creation of a unique system that
may have far-reaching implications in society once it gets
off the small, experimental scale it is at now -- if even
such a terse communication is too much trouble, then farm
out the job to a hireling --

Do not try to suggest that the micro editor be made into
something at least partially useable.  That would require
a complete overhaul, massive changes, a total rewrite,
and the systems programmers are too busy.  Besides, the
way the system loads the "official" micro whenever some-
one sneezes, there is no real use for this eminently useful
feature.

Can the routine that accepts search objects in the editor
be altered to accept the access and font keys? It is
inconvenient, to say the least, to want to find an
embed with the commands "x¬0a," and to find oneself
looking at a piece of code containing '0a'
If it is not convenient to cause printing of the proper
acessed and fonted characters in the editor, then
represent access and font by constructs, say,¬, and ¬A=¬D.
While it would be less convenient for the novice this
way, it would at least allow searches.

---------- response 1

It will accept access (shift square), but not micro.
It will not accept font, but you can search for font
by entering a search string in the -m- option.

You _can_ search for a FONT in the string.  As best as I can
tell, the command pseudo-arrow is a pause loop which plots
out valid keys as it comes across them. Thus, when it
plots access, no apparent change occurs.Similarly, when
a FONT is plotted, you can't see any difference.  However,
it _is_ there.

RE:  *list symbols

Can this option be changed so that it does NOT compile

now, it will gather all symbols it can find including
strange symbols taken from each sentence of a NOTES block

Better yet, the *list symbols command should have following

the locations of the blocks:

*list symbols (start,defines,blockx)

*list symbols [1a-1f,3c,15g]

if you have a *list parts in the 1st bloc, it will still
include as "symbols" some things in that bloc whether the
condense flag for bloc -a- is on or off -- i have gotten
some prints with fragments of notes I stored in the bloc -a-
which we usually use as a notes ¬+ misc info bloc -- you have
to * out all lines so they are not taken as tutor "code"

A simple change that ignored symbols in uncondensed blocks
would be a plague to those who have lots of "use" blocks
stashed here and there in spare spaces (to get a complete

or unwanted ecs use if those lessons happened to be
condensed while waiting for the print).

        Actually, it was my understanding, from those dis-
cussions way back when, that it is the performance of the
lesson which can_not_ be copyrighted. If I remember correct-
ly, Maggs of law , et. al., stated that, in order to copy-
right lesson materials (as the system people wish to do
eventually), it would be necessary to print the _text_
_displayed_ and relevant graphical displays, and then copy-
right _that_. This is not the same as copyrighting the per-
formance of the lesson (whatever that might be defined as),
it is more like the regular copyright procedures for text
books. The facts is, that copyrighting computer software
(such as PLATO lessons) has a dubious legal status, due to
Supreme Court action within the last two years.
        This was my understanding of the issue. If I'm

I notice that the editor's method of handling access keys
has changed again. If one writes a string of universal
delimiters like
test¬,¬,¬,
all is well, but an attempt to use the edit key to replace
the final t results in
tesl,¬,¬,
with the access code being dropped for the first delimiter.
Furthermore, using the edit key to pick the entire line up
and lay it down again yields the following results per press

(1¬Dtest) (2¬D¬") (3¬+4¬D¬,) (5¬+6¬D¬,)

Was this change intentional? Is it permanent?

One major reason for the recent changes of EDIT handling
was to make strings such as
  FONT, a, MICRO, FONT
behave the same way with EDIT as they behave with the
ERASE key. ERASE treats the string above as a single

You are asking for it. The incredible "male chauvinism"
(to use an overworked and therefore nearly meaningless
term) among author-users of this system has been a source
of dismay to me since becoming a PLATO user. I have been
reluctantly forced to conclude that this attitude is the
result of the fact that so many users are from the
engineering-math type curriculums, which are dominated, to
say the least, by males. Of course, a case could be made
that the reason some people are in a curriculum like this
is the "male sheild" set up makes it easier on them.

Unfortunately, Grohne was right, and so is Nawrocki: notice

alas, (b) a kind of unthinking maleness: check out not only
poor "talkomatic" but pseudonyms in games, etc. But the
further aspects of the question Jean raised need time and
space to deal with(Grohne's mentioning of the all-boy cul-

Sorry for the trouble. Discuss has needed a major overhaul
for some time. It was never designed for the heavy use
(greater than 25 users) it has received concerning this
topic. I never realized this topic would be so popular.
The experience is valuable in designing future programs.

The useful life of a plato lesson is quite short. Looking
at two year old code is quite a shock. No records (courses)
segment, student data, most branches, many system variables
the entire storage/common/dataset mappings. A tremendous
amount of progress on the system is evident. Probably
lessons authored now will have similar troubles two years
hence. Writing a plato lesson nearly commits one to a
lifetime of updating their code. Some commands are changed
significantly, some perfectly usable code two years ago
now is too inefficient to run properly.

I've often been angered by the entries in these notes that
I considered trivial, inane, thoughtless, obscure, or
insensitive; but I've also found that others don't share
my views of particular notes, and that out of the welter of
opinions one or two provocative ideas occasionally emerge.

The 'best thinking' of the kind you seem to want is already
readily available in easy-to-curl-up-with hardcopy media.
Since your purpose doesn't seem to be interaction, why
choose an interactive medium?

An alternative thought: if you could get some of the
'leading thinkers' on today's issues to 'publish' articles
in your journal, and could then get them to follow up with
an on-line Q and A session (not real-time like talko, but
in a NOTES format), you would be doing something innovative
that made greater use of the system's unique capabilities.

use these to comment on PLATO, lessons, and to vent

Dr. Hody's comments are completely irresponsible. The
transmission of journal type information via a
computer-based communications medium is a well recognized
scientific concern. Indeed, those that advocate such
systems claim major benefits in the disemination of
scientific (and literary) information. One of the
most significant is a dramatic reduction in the 1 to
3 year lag time of many scientific journals. As the
reduction of this lag time could become a crucial need
of future world problems of enormous magnitude, experience
with potential solutions is to be encouraged. NSF's Office
of Scientific Information (I hope I quoted the title
exactly) has been concerned with this problem for some
time. The Atlantic Monthly is the best editted magazine
I know of. Good Luck, Cornell, if your effort reaches

There is a continuing effort by some plato users (again,
most notably Dr. Hody) to label certain uses of the
plato system "educational", "games" or "communication"
with the implication that narrowly defined "educational"
(student interacts with a lesson written by a teacher)
uses should receive highest priority. This distinction
is meaningless. The educational effectiveness of certain
"games" has been demonstrated by others. I personally
believe computer-based educational facilities using so-
called "communications" lessons will be at least as
important as the other, temporarily dominate, mode.
Derek J. de Sol la Price's book, Big Science, Little
Science, is useful in understanding how this could come
about, particulary through making "invisible colleges"
(the communications which occurs among the leaders of a
discipline) "visible" through computer-based means.

  I wish to emphasize that this is an issue of the
highest importance. I am thankful that the PLATO staff
is, and has been, far more open-minded than some members
of its user community. Once a severe regulation of
lesson material is implemented, the system will cease
to be a viable educational resource. I might point out
that perhaps the most thoughtful criticism of the PLATO
concept is the increased degree of centralization of
education possible, as noted in Professor Slotnick's
Miller lecture a few weeks ago. Some form of computer
based conferencing arrangement using a centralized system
is the only way I know of avoiding the potential problems
noted in this lecture. Hence, the journal idea and
conferencing advocates perform a valuable service to the
system by making it less susceptable to such criticism.

Of course, there's nothing wrong with the idea of a literary

there is no implication whatever of any experience,

        Hmmm... That may be so, but I'm sure that there is
at least one experienced, opinionated, interesting party
out there somewhere (any ideas, Hody?).

        The fact is that there are irresponsible authors on
PLATO (or perhas just authors without much to say), but
there are also irresponsible doctors, lawyers, and --let's
face it, folks--educators, too. As in all those pro-
fessions, the per-centage of such driftwood is low. The
fact is, there are many professional, highly competent peo-
ple on the PLATO system who would, we think, enjoy hearing
the opinions of their fellows on issues of the day.
        As for the alluded-to long-windedness of our group,
I can only say that our initial note specifically and ex-
plicitly asked that these responses be directed to my

Just to answer a few dangling charges:

1) Sorry I took "bump obscenities" seriously. I honestly
   don't know which of Dr. Hody's suggestions are tongue
   in-cheek, and which ones are not.

2) To Dave Frye:

       There are about 10,000 graduate students on this
campus. This substantial student group is not likely
to obtain significant educational enlightenment from an
interactive explanation of fortran do loops, chemical
titration procedures (titrate) or basic genetics (fly),
no matter how well these lessons are authored (the latter
two are excellent). The use of the PLATO system for
graduate education is a topic which is relatively
unexplored. I am concerned specifically with the thesis
research-original contribution stage of learning. What
sort of lessons are likely to be most valuable here?

---------- response 27
  05/10     13.21     carter       comm

My tentative conclusions on this issue are that the use
of interactive tutorial programs written by teachers will
play a relatively minor role. Far more valuable to a
graduate student would be computer-based conferences with
other researchers in his(her) discipline. Journals such
as proposed by the Cornell group would make recent research
results available much faster than is now possible. The
necessity of staying abreast of the state-of-the-art when
attempting to make an original contribution should be
self evident.

        I am sorry Dave has taken such a narrow view of
"benefiting students" and the nature of a "curriculum".
I occasionally have such feelings as well. I take it as
a sign that I have been involved too deeply in detail
(whether it be programming, circuit design, etc.) and
need to spend some time contemplating what it is all
about.

A few more dangling accusations:

1) Dave, I don't think I have ever forced anyone to do
anything. If you have no interest in communication with
other researchers in you specialty, there is no coersion,
just as there is no one forcing you to learn chemistry
via PLATO.

2) Regarding Dr. Hody's concern for the economical use of
file space, I can only reply that my contributions are
infrequent, and only large when I consider the issue to
be of exceptional importance. I am willing to bet that
the disk space required my all my notes since August 72
is less than the space required to store the games tirades
inspired by Dr. Hody.

        It would appear that our concept of an electronic
journal has evoked considerable interest and controversy.
We believe Mr. Carter has put forward our philosophy
most succinctly. The concept of the electronic journal
is to provide with a rapidity and availability heretofore
unattainable, scientific and literary ideas and opinions
        The sciences and the humanities
are crippled by what may be termed a communications
bottleneck. Selectivity is forced upon the traditional
journals due to sheer volume of contributions, thereby
shutting off the only general outlet for serious
scientific, philosophical, and literary work for many
contributors. Even those contributions accepted take
months to years to progress from the submission to
publication state. Computer telecommunication systems
would appear to provide the solution to this most critical
problem.

finally we agree on something, russ-- computer
telecommunication would be a magnificent contribution
to the problem of keeping scholars updated...

but if you've ever tried to work seriously in the

any quantity, you'll realize that plato doesn't have
the resources to provide even much of a research-- much
less a service-- tool in this area.

     The reason I termed Dr. Hody's comments irresponsible
is that his concept of what is educational is severely
constrained. As a result, he terms serious educational
efforts of others as "questionable". This is inexcusable.
Computer-based education is in such an early state that
it is impossible to determine at present what the most
effective strategies are. The PLATO adminstration has
diversity of material.
   Diverse uses are particulary essential in the early
development of a new medium since they may influence its
development. This influence could be essential to the
survival of the medium (plato). There is a growing body
of people who see so-called "personal computers" being
able to duplicate the traditional plato lesson without
the disadvantages of a centralized system within 10 years.
Clearly, diversity is essential.

"an issue of the greatest importance"... Well, is it? True,
we as authors are always experimenting with new ideas here,
and I personally like the idea of a journal. But IS IT THAT
IMPORTANT? Is it, when we wonder whether or not we'll hit
the 500-terminal mark and still have the CPU punch to edit?
Is it, when author groups and remote sites are clamoring for
more and more file space, and the space is not there to give
them? Is it. when we hear increasingly often about stolen

there are sections of our router where the router variables
are undergoing complex manipulations -- these sections
should not be interruptible , but the kids do manage
to hit shift stop during execution of this code. This
leaves the record in a bad state ( unless we abort
the record in the finish unit, which has other undesirable
side effects)

perhaps a command to create an uninterruptible state for
a limited time , with an execution error for not turning
the state off within a given period?

Use the 'return' command before you start executing
your critical section (CS). I believe the stop1 key
will not be processed until the next time slice, thus
you are assured your code will be executed. It might
be wise to test your CS's to make sure that they do
not exceed 1 time slice.

You assume, of course, (a) that all the needed code can

(b) is no longer true either.

How about:

nostop N $$ where N is a time in seconds

Any press of STOP1 before N seconds have elapsed is held
in abeyance until the time limit is over, THEN processed
normally. Thus a press of STOP1 is executed as usual, only
NOT in critical sections of code. The maximum permissible
value of N would be on the order of 3 - 5 seconds I assume.

---------- response 4

True, but I use this method with great succes. BUT
I never have critical sections more than a few calc's long.
Perhaps what is needed is the following:

* non-critical section
*
reserve record $$insure this code is executed
*
*critical section
*
release record $$return to normal execution
*
* non-critical section

Thus the lesson could delay processing of any keypress
until the release record was executed or x number of
timeslices had been used.

        Mark, John Risken is right about timeslices. Tests
now indicate that a timeslice can be as little as 4-10 msec
(and it can vary....) Thus no amount of testing in advance
can guarantee that a certain section of code will always
be executed in one timeslice.
        Gary's suggestion seems quite worthwhile, as
finish units can now even take 5-10 seconds to be completed.
It would probably be nescessary to have the stop1 key
come through at the end of the restricted period, which
might be a little hard to implement.

A guarante of "nostop" for some specific real-time
interval may increase the probablility, but does not
provide certainty that code which may take more than one
timeslice to execute will be completed. BIG autobreaks
could eat up the whole guaranteed interval. Maybe a
specific allotment of proctime? Even that might fail if
one had to fiddle around a lot waiting for dataset
operations to be completed, etc..
maybe:?
nostop $$ commands following will be executed before any
       $$ new key is processed
.... any command in this sequence which ordinarily would
     permit input, i.e. arrow, pause, waiting at the end
     of a unit, some provision for fatal loop, or exec of
     "okstop" would terminate the effect of the "nostop".

 I think that the stop1 should not be echoed. When the
student presses stop1 and it doesn't work he will become
frustrated and press it several times.Then instead of being
returned to the router he is thrown entirely off the system.

While revising the lesson data, would it be possible to

security code, with only this "master" code having the
ability to change security codes?

I have recently discovered some student authors who were
to share a lesson had changed codes. I believe it was
not malicious, and as they had not changed (or had left
blank) the "change" code, I was able to repair. But the
potential of one locking out the others (and the instructor

---------- response 5
  05/09    11.21     white       p

Another idea suggested would be to have two levels
of security codes on the lesson. The top level
(group level?) code would be known by the group
director, and maybe a few others, and would allow
changing anything in the lesson, including the
lower security code. The lower code would allow
changing anything in the lesson other than the
top security code. Thus a group director can
"give" a lesson to some author in the group, the
author can do anything to the lesson he wishes, without
the current bother to group directors of keeping a list
of codewords on lessons.

This differs from the suggestion in the original note
of this sequence, since it assumes competent authors
knowing the lower security code.

to k mast of p:
        Your suggestion would help,as then I could always
        untangle the mess. But student authors could still
        be locked out of a shared lesson by classmates until
        I got on to repair the security codes.

to white of p:
        Your idea sounds excellent, providing the top level
        security code is required to change the lower one.

        The assumption of competent authors is a very
        hazardous one. Some provision for beginning authors
        to learn the basics without the risk of interfering
        with others is needed.

minor because with all the other major changes in structure

We currently don't keep that information during condensing.
It would be possible to add it, but you probably don't
want condensing to take any longer than it does. I would
suggest you use lesson search for the few times you need
such information.

---------- note 103 X-search
  05/10     12.08     judy       pso

It would be very convenient for me if the X-search had
an option which would let me specify that I was searching
for an entry in the command field. I find the "C" option
in the editor very useful.

For example....

I am searching a whole -leslist- of lessons because I have
a complaint that "some of the lessons don't have the proper
-end lesson-". So I search for "end" and get all sorts of
extra garbage like "apprehend the criminal".

---------- response 1
  05/10     12.23     rick       mflu

When I need a command search in the X-search option, I
type the command followed by enough spaces to make the
search object eight characters long (the size of the
TUTOR command field). True, it's not the best solution,
due to long commands like jumpout, compute etc., but
it does work most of the time--It's not too often that
you'll find something like "apprehend the criminal"!

---------- response 2

A unit search would also be nice.

---------- response 3
  05/10     15.50     judy       pso

Yes, the "extra spaces" technique is a sneaky fix, But
wouldn't it be faster for the X-search-er to only examine
the command field?

---------- response 4
  05/10     16.03     white       p

No, it wouldn't be faster to just examine the command
field. The current routine can search an entire block
(or there blocks?) with a single search command. The
routine you propose would involve, inplemented the
simple way, finding the end of a line, and then looking
to see if the start of the line has what you are looking
for.

I would suggest you learn to search the "sneaky" way (as
you describe it). That is, when searching for an
"end lesson", you search for "nd les", or when
searching for unit test, search for "t test" (or
"y test", as the case may be).

I agree, it would be convienent to be able to search
the command field, or search for a unit.

---------- response 5
  05/10     16.06     judy       pso
Sigh! I just searched for "use "and got umpty-zillion

thing....

---------- response 6
  05/10     17.27     white       uimatah

Thats strange, since -pause (blank)- can only have three
blanks after it (unless it also has a comment after
it), and a -use- must have at least five blanks. Are
you sure you searched for "use  " instead of "use "?

---------- response 7
  05/10     20.16     judy       pso

You're quite right.. I didn't get enough spaces after
"use  ".

---------- response 8
  05/11     12.08     frankel       p

By the way, searching for something at the start of the
line WOULD be a fair amount faster, since a FIND command
could be used, rather than SEARCH.

        The catchup command is not working as advertised.
        A test unit shows that output is aborted, and a
full screen erase executed long before output initiated
by a -showa- is completed. Long ago, there used to be some-
what of a correlation between the stated function of catchup
and its actual execution characteristics. I noticed a
change in it a while back that would cause some output to
be aborted before all the output generated was done, but
could be fixed with 2 -catchups-

     What he wants, is the last date the student was

changes had been made so that you could let the student
know if anything was different since he last came on.
That info in available through readr, but it is possible
that this would be useful for other  types of lessons
which are used by a diversity of students.
     I agree that this would be nice. but it's probably
not "of high priority".

  05/12     19.42     frankel       p

In case anybody is wondering what happened to PLATO earlier
today, here's the story, in chronological order.

6:45AM A power cable from the U of I power plant to various
        university buildings was cut (no one knows where,
        how, or why yet). Naturally, our building was one
        of those hit, and the lights (and other accessories,
        such as the computer) went off.

7:15 After a spare cable was connected, power was
     restored. Our computer engineers, who had been
     working on the computer when the power went off
     (preventive maintence time), proceeded to turn the
     computer power back on. It is known from experience
     that a sudden shut-down, such as a power failure,
     can often cause minor damage to the computer. So,
     the engineers prepared to run some tests to insure
     that...(continued)

        everything was in order. When they pressed the
        button to load the tape, nothing happened. It
        looked like the PPU (a small computer used, in this
        case, to load the tape) was failing, and a PPU
        memory stack was replaced. The second attempt to
        load also failed. The hunt for the problem
        continued until around 6 PM, when it was discovered
        that access to Central Memory was being blocked by
        a defective circuit. A module was replaced and
        everything was working (except, of course, for the
        standard ECS failures, which took only half an hour
        to fix). It turns out that had documentation about
        the maintenace tape (furnished by Control Data) been
        correct, the problem probably would have been fixed
        before noon.

6:30PM PLATO returned.

The long introduction pages exist for these reasons:

1) The lesson was originally designed for first time
   Plato users who need plenty of explanation.

2) The lesson was implemented before the advent of
   course recored, making entry more involved.
   This feature has the advantage of permitting truly
   "delphi" (anonomous) comments since the true name
   is not stored at all!! The conferencing literature
   confirms the advantage of this facility in encouraging
   free discussion.

3) One of the intro pages was inserted by systems in
   response to pressure from federal authorities
   concerned about the use of the program by Stuart
   Umpleby who provided a test case of free speech
   via a computer-based communications medium. He lost.

4) The lesson in nearly obsolete and will be replaced as
   soon as I hustle some funding for some experiments.

How much time was actually used by the system and how
much was used by used lessons? Now how much time is used
by the system and how much is used by user lessons?
(i.e. The system consumed 1/5 of the amount of CPU consumed
by user lessons)

---------- response 9

The system itself uses only a few percent of the machine.
This change had to do with the users part....creating the
output words specified by your lesson and delivering them in

      Since there is no more room for responses in the
original note, we will continue the discussion of our
journal idea here. We are happy indeed to see that our
idea has provoked so much spirited debate among members
of the PLATO community.
     For those who have asked, we are in the software
development stage of production. We are currently writing
the Editor and Formatter, which will be used to enter and
prepare articles for publication.

     standard is kept high. I will be most upset
     if I realized that I just wasted some time to

     Although the forum should be open to any idea,
     there should be some insulation between the
     contributors and public circulation. I propose
     that you guys organize a board of editors first.
     If anybody puts in an article, the board should
     collectively review to decide whether to publish
     , rejet, or return it to the contributor.....just
     like journal. ??It's for protection of readers.
Part of Dr. Hody's suggestion is legitimate. There should

-show- type commands with a specified length of zero do not
do anything (as one might properly expect)--with one
exception: a -showo- with a specified length of zero
which immediately follows another -showo- (or -showe-, but
not -showa-; I have not checked the other possibilities),
results in an exact repeat of the output from that preceding
-show- type command. Still worse, a -showo- with length zero
that is the first -show- type command in the unit results
in the plotting of random garbage (mostly, but not always,
numerical...sometimes nothing...once in a while really
exotic garbage). This is not a huge problem, but I thought
I should report it. It can be confusing.

It is possible to assemble individual programs in which

   It doesn't say "assembly completed" but rather
"completely assembled"--which lovely jargon is meant
to indicate when ALL the (50 or so) sub-programs were
re-assembled (around a 30 minute or more job even when
there is lots of CPU time available). This is normally
done only when a change is made to the parameters or
tables that are common to all routines.

what this world needs, in addition to a 5c=/ cigar and
a $1000 PLATO terminal is a system option for comments.

* the suggestion is that a student or author could
type term "comment" anywhere in any lesson. They would
get instructions and enter a one line at a time comment
(max about 10 lines at a time) on the bottom three lines
of the screen (which good authors leave empty or unessential
anyhow, right?)... the information would be dumped for
a dataset belonging to the author group responsible for
the lesson and a special editor would be available to
the author for read out, printing, and transfer of comments.
*
the readout would include automatic record of the sign
on name and course, date and time, lesson, and main, base
and current and perhaps the current area if one was
specified (continued in reply i hope)...

now-- what about an editor for the student? well... a
feature which would enable the student to edit one line
at a time, roll forward and back, would be nice-- as would
the option to see all comments upon leaving the lesson
and perhaps edit them then (maybe leaving by a DATA1 instead
of SHIFT1?)-- but that would be sheer frosting-- the comment
is the important thing, edited or not.
*
what about the plans for "group notes" which would
do almost the same thing but, i believe, a page at a
time... well, the full screen (or part) erase is pretty
undesirable.
*
is one line at a time enough! you bet it is... try
some of the proprietary versions of this around and you
will see with a little experience, it works great...

        A facility such as Dr. Hody suggests is planned, in
fact your ideas strangely enough almost exactley correspond
to what my thoughts on the matter have been recently. That
a one or two line editor be developed to allow students to
write comments to be sent to a file attached to the course
that the student is enrolled in. Instructors and course
directors will be able to look at the comments, respond to
them and even re-send them either to a person as a personal
note, or to a group notes file of sorts. Though details
have not been worked out, I expect to see some type of
comments facility within a year.

Such data is plenty easy to collect. Geo. Carter designed
a general comments lesson a couple of years ago which
collected some of the material you mentioned. See lesson
comment or comments. Interconnection is one of the easiest
things in the world. However, you are cautioned that some
of the features used are outdated (by Carter's own ad-
mission) but an updated version would fill many of the
needs you mentioned. You probably shouldn't try to
interconnect to the lesson w/o contacting Carter (carter of
comm) first, though. I'm not suggesting his lesson as a
model, but as an example which has served well for two yrs.

  I agree with Dr. Hody. I made a similar suggestion
about two years ago. Don't use my lesson, "comments",
it is obsolete for general use purposes. In fact, one
reason such a facility needs to be implemented at the
systems level (other than the ecs savings) is that systems
would then maintain it. Maintaining PLATO programs is
not a trivial matter.

  On the philosophical level, I have often been puzzled
by the existence of elaborate data collection facilities
(student data) that totals nearly every keypress
presumably so that the data will lead to lesson improvement
but no system facility to collect student comments,
despite the large number of "comment" programs that have
been written. Having a system facility to enable students
to tell an author directly what is wrong with the lesson
seems to be such an obvious feature.

   The SHIFTed square key is called (access) because it
provides access to several characters in the terminal
memory which are not available by single keypresses.

  i.e. ¬a, ¬m, ¬t, ¬I, ¬$, etc.

This use to the (access) key _is_ documented in aids.
These characters can also be accessed via MICRO-keypress
if a MICROtable has been defined using the access key.

---------- response 4

  In other words, if you have your own micro table loaded,
you can still access the standard micro table with the
shifted square key. As for the unshifted key working on the
edit buffer-- it also works on the copy and buffer. EXTREMELY
handy! (When you have the copy and edit buffers, the square
pulls chars first from the copy buffer, and then the edit.)

The square key was revised last semester to "pull" the
characters from which ever buffer (copy or edit) was last
used. [Originally, it would take characters from the copy
buffer until it was empty, then from the edit buffer.]

---------- response 6
  05/14     13.12     warner       iu

Not quite right about the unshifted square key...
It indeed pulls characters from a buffer, one at a time,
and adds them to the arrow. If there are no characters
left in the buffer, the square key does nothing. Now...
as to _which_ buffer, obviously the edit buffer is used
if there is no buffer for the copy key. (Note:
for further details about the EDIT and COPY keys,
see aids, DATA edit and copy.)
If both edit and copy buffers are active, the square key
is switched between them according to which key was last
pressed. Pressing the COPY key causes the square key to
take its next character from the copy buffer. Hitting EDIT
causes the square key to extract from the edit buffer.
As soon as the copy buffer is empty, the square key
takes only from the edit buffer.
It's complicated, I know, but it results in the square
key working the way you might intuitively expect it.

      I believe that the  "where" position is saved

it. Thus, to change the "where" permanently, you must
do an -at- after the arrow. I suppose this is so that
the system default of 3 lines down doesn't mess up
people's carefully organized programs. I believe it
should stay this way.

Almost. I believe that the position is changed because

It might get changed sometime in the future; like we

you use a regular -at- with an absolute value for now.

In fact, it is a property of any number processor (including

rounded numbers. For example, 1/12=.0833...3 so
6?7.0833...3)=.4999...9 no matter how many decimal places
are retained despite the fact that 6/12 is exactly .5 .
This can also cause problems in situations like
sqrt (a?b-c?d) where a?b = c?d but rounding causes c?d to
be one bit larger (giving a tiny negative value and a

data should be collected in a particular lesson. Why not
try specifying two different starting points in the in-

that data should not be collected for that student, then
the router would start him in a unit which had a 'dataoff'.
The default option would be that all students would be

Request:
Users have been given the capability of using more than one
dataset in one lesson. Since usually the same routines are
being used with one as with the other, it is sometimes
necessary to know the length in blocks of the current daya-
set, so that appropriate measures can be taken. The way
this seems to be handled now is: read through dataset blocks
until -error- is set to 2, and subtract 1.

I want the number of blocks there are in the dataset, not
the number of words. After all, you access a dataset with
the block number, not the word number.

Therefore an "n" seems appropriate to me.

I stand corrected, eight letters is too many.
How about "ndset"?

By the way......no, I don't read in every single block
until I find one not there to determine the number of blocks
in the dataset. But the calculation is still a pain.

a time-consuming search (and, of course, the

   I might suggest the use of the "X" option

Well, no matter how you look at it, whether you go through
and look block by block or whether you could have a search
option which would look through the blocks for you and take
you to the block (and unit)  in which unit unitname
actually occurs, you still have to do the same disc amount
of disc accesses. Now the one thing you have going for you
is that at some time you might remember where you put the
unit whereas the search would invariably find it (if it is
found at all)  in the last block it would search thru. So
a little brainwork might be better than having a routine
to waist disc accesses. But if you were so desperate as to
have to find it right away, there is lesson search (either
type in search at the author mode page or a capital x(X)
on that same page), which will look thru user specified
lessons for a specified object (allowing for the fact that
you know the change code to the lesson.)

As far as I could determine in a couple of quickie tests
I just tried. lesson search _doesnt_ put the name of the
first lesson in the list (if that's what you meant) but
simply doesnt use n1 in the lesson at all.  Therefore,  if
you went into a lesson, then went into lesson search
and did some searchin', and then left the lesson, you would
find that the name of the lesson you last were in before
going into search would be in n1.

        Wishful thinking, but it would be a good idea
nonthelless. Since most people just do into search to look
for a particular thing and then back to editing, it
would be a convenience to be able to go to the first (prime)
lesson name in the list.

Oh well, another one for the low priority bucket.

Strange, I get the feeling this subject has been discussed
before. Seems to me the option was always there. It is
just when you took your normal "abnormal" exit from lesson
"X" aka "search" via the stop?1 key that n1 didn't contain
the last lesson you were editing.  Seems to me most of
the utility lessons around are like that, and have been
for quite a while. Who ever thought of stop?1ing out of
"S" aka "type your security code"? Did you ever notice
that THAT doesn't zero n1? Did you ever thank anyone for
it? Could it be that that is the normal way to do things?

what I understand, they generate square waves from

Both of these systems allow the composed to write programs

There seems to be an important difference between
"end lesson" and "lesson completed" other than that the
student is able to shift/stop in the latter and still have
the star recorded on the index page.

Here goes: when plato sees the "end lesson" it immediately
takes the student to the index if he presses next (or
if he presses an appropriate no. to take him to the end
lesson unit); on the other hand, when plato sees the
"lesson completed" message it immediately takes the
student to the next physically located unit when the
student presses next!

This is crucial for authors to know in that if "lesson
completed" is used, it normally would need to be placed

The Navy Personnel Research and Development Center has
developed a lesson model for learner control of lesson
strategy which will be of interest to authors looking
for a paradigm which lets the student control lesson
strategy. It will also be of interest to authors looking
for a way to prepare lessons without getting all wrapped
up in branching and control problems. The lesson is
'learner'. It contains instructive content designed to
tell how to use it and what it does. Our experience with
it has been most rewarding. We'd be glad to have others use
this model for different kinds of lesson materials; hence
this note. Please direct comments to gf lahey, course mtc.

It does seem to be an implementation of Bunderson's model.
Putting pedagogical considerations aside for the moment,
I must say that your choice of keys to implement the branch-
ing functions leaves much to be desired. Even allowing for
the habit-patterns acquired from years of authoring on
PLATO" I don't think the key functions chosen are readily
assimilable, and will certainly present problems to the
student familiar with so-called "standard" PLATO key con-
ventions. Possibly my criticisms are unfair, since the
PLATO keyset is quite unlike Bunderson's, but I think the
point should be made.

It's actually left-justified into the second of the three-

that the system does not guarantee exactly how the string
returned by -lname- will look in octal, just that a -showa
name,30- will display the lesson name properly. You'll
either have to write a leslist alphbetizer which will

        While we are on the subject of leslists,
I'd like to bring up a little point. I was doing some
looping involving pulling lesson names out of my leslist,
when I got a very neat execution error. This is what the
code looked like:
doto    1check,times?1,322
lname   into,times
     *..some code..*
1check
        Now, this would cause an execution error on lname.
Adding a little counter to find out on which loop it blows
up on, I found that this number varied. The reason for the
error was the fact that leslists are numbered 0-321 instead
of 1-322, and I was going out of range. Two questions:
Why number leslists 0-321?????
Why did the number of loops very when it blew up?????
(I'm assuming the cause to be a out of range type error.)

---------- response 4
  05/20     12.28     friedman       csa

Well, for one thing: If leslists were numbered 1-322,
then the variable -error- after certain leslist commands
(e.g., -addl-) could have a negative value or a positive
value, but never a 0 valde. That could lead to some strange
looking conditional commands.?
Besides, what's so special about 1-322? Computers always
count from 0(well, frequently, anyway).

---------- note 390 release
  05/19     17.53     eland       csa
In my lesson there are certain "critical sections" of code
surrounded by "lock" and "unlock" primitives to implement
mutual exclusion. The lock and unlock are implemented
via reserve and release.?
If someone stop1's out while holding a reservation, (i.e. he
was the last to do "lock"), I want to abort common. But if
he has executed a release, I do NOT want to abort common.
The easiest way to test whether to abort is to execute a
release and see if it succeeds. UNFORTUNATELY, the
release seems to succeed even if he does NOT currently hold
a reservation. It is my impression that the release will
fail only if someone else has a reservation.?
If my impression is wrong, could someone please set me
straight. Otherwise, could someone set the behavior of
release straight: if one does not could something, how can
he successfully release it??

According to -aids-, -zreturn- is set in exactly the
same way for both commands. A quick check shows this is
so. Apparently, you are going to have to keep a flag in
the student bank. Have fun.

---------- response 2
  05/19     21.18     white       p

After looking at the code:

   There is no difference in *zreturn* if you do a -release-
and it isn't reserved, or if you do a -reserve- and you
already have it, so your lesson can't tell by using these
commands if this station already has it reserved.
   The solution the system could give you would be a return
of, say, -2, if the reserve or release didn't do anything,
ie, it was already reserved at this station or it wasn't
reserved, respectively.
   The solution I would do until then would be to have
a different -finish- unit set in the critical section of
code, one that aborted common and jumped to the regular
finish unit.

Note: currently, if in the finish unit, you do a reserve
or release, and someone else has it reserved, you get an
exxecution error. This will be fixed on the next Plato.

Thanks for your informative response. I hope the system
will give us something like the idea of setting zreturn to
-2. In the meantime, I will retain the flags I was using
before return and release were implemented. Thanks!?

I am going to be leaving soon, and would like to leave my
work in its final state if possible.

White:

Your interim solution is elegant, but leaves one tiny hole.
Which happens first: setting the finish unit or
executing the code to reserve the critical section?
Unless both are done at the same time there will
still be a problem.

Seconded. Returning to a router with what one believes

Given a multiplier of the order of magnitude of 10ˆ4 implies
that every set of numbers, a?i and a?j in a 'random' series
such that ¬Ia?i-a?j¬I<10?ˆ-4 ??implies a??i+1 ?ˆwill be highly
correlated with a??j?1?ˆ. This does not seem bad until one
considers that in a series of 10ˆ4 'random' numbers the
expectation of the number of times ¬Ia?i-a?j¬I<10?ˆ-4?? will occure
will be 10?ˆ-4??[10ˆ4(10ˆ4-1)/2] which equals about 5000.

else is there at this time)...that way there is no extra
keypress and hardly any extra time involved...it is
an improvement over what it used to be before the last
improvement to author signon...seems nice.

I'm all in favor of the "last signed on at" idea. Shouldn't
get too many people upset about the extra time involved in
displaying such info. Anything else is readily available
from the author mode page.

I am not sure I understand. Is there still the possibility
of someone writing a phoney sign-on lesson to steal a
sign-on, I was under the impression that was fixed with
the -shift stop-. You could always press - shift stop-
no matter what was on the screen to eliminate this problem.
Also the best way to prevent sign-on thefts is to frequenly
change your password. So I donn't think the change is
necessary.

They arnt talking about phony author pages in lessons..
These have been stopped for the most part.

        If, when an author signs-in in the morning, he
wants to check his last signon time and date (to see if
someone has stolen his code and used his records) he
has to remember to press LAB after password instead
of next, then DATA, then finally NEXT before he sees the
'Author Mode' page.

        If warner's suggestion were implemented,
authors would see the last time and date info along
with 'Author Mode' the FIRST time they saw author mode.
The info would not be shown once the person starts
working...

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:
        I'll be in C-U all summer and I need to find a job
on PLATO. I've been programming since early '73 and was on
the system before then. I've had jobs with emphasis on
graphic display and judging, most of the judging being in a
program for the Elementary Education department. That
lesson is called eled. It's not very imaginative but is
what was wanted. Because of that lesson I've had quite a
but of practice with many different phases of judging and
a lot of work with -concept-. The basic program design was
just rewritten using -judge quit-, a feature I requested
in January. If you know of any openings, please contact me.

Thank you.

     I believe there is a need for an answerc command.
It would work exactly like the exactc command except that
it would do spelling checks, etc.. I think that the command
could be written very easily and would only save system
resources(cpu,ecs.) Consider the following code:
arrow   1010
at      910
write   Who was the ¬0s,number¬1 th president?
answerc number-2,Washington,John Adams,Jefferson,...

This would take less processing time than having many answer
commands and judging using anscnt, and it would use less
ecs than having many separate answer units that are joined
at the right time.

when a judging or graphing command is requested in AIDS,

option of requesting additional details ¬+ examples by
pressing LAB. is this format more useful than the previous

In the dataset editor, if you enter a block and press

     Maureen Hoffman and I are painfully aware of the

space. Sometimes you get space within minutes of making a
request and sometimes it takes a week or more to learn you
won't be getting any for a while. There are several legiti-
mate reasons for it taking so long, but that doesn't ease
the anxiety caused by waiting.

To help ease the pain, I have asked Maureen to try to
respond to every request within 24 hours (or the next
working day in the case of requests entered on the weekend
or in her absence).
This doesn't mean you will get the space you request that
fast. Rather, you will get a note asking for clarification
of your request; or saying that part of the request has been
filled and the rest will or will not be at some specified
date; or that we won't know until some specified date
whether you may have the space you requested.

I hope this helps. Let me know.

Recently, EDIT and COPY were changed so that an access code
sticks to the preceeding character. As a result, using the
EDIT and COPY keys on a string containing access codes be-
comes a total farce. For example:
assume you have

writec n1¬,*¬,¬,

in your copy buffer, You want to type

Obviously, you type COPY COPY AC=CCESS COMMA COPY1.
This gives you the abominable string

writec n1¬¬,,*¬,¬,

which contains a double access code. Now, if one could see
access codes, this would be fine, but one cannot, and there
is no documentation of the behaviour of EDIT and COPY

anywhere on the system, so the average joe, i.e. someone
who does not know all the gory details of this absurd and
illogical process, will be totally lost. He will probably
end up with a TRIPLE access code before the first comma,
and the resultant condense error will proceed to stump a
consultant for hours (be.warned, consultants, to watch for
this in the future). Now, was this done to make EDIT
inconsistent with the ERASE key, or merely to make PLATO
harder to use for non-experts?

It was done in an attempt to fix things somewhat for
the language people whose students type:
   alge¬elala
and then want to change the e¬e. French uses their own
character for the ¬e , so the accent is provided via a
micro table, etc.

Well, in order to make ERASE work nicely, the string
FONT, letter, ACCESS, FONT is treated as one "unit" by
the ERASE key. However, the EDIT key does not (did not?)
treat this string properly, which made the nice ERASE
features of FONT, letter, ACCESS, FONT completely useless
for the language people.

Don Lee has been suffering for a long time typing to get
a set of conventions installed which will work consistently
and "sensibly" for all of the editting keys.

Ok. Let me get this straight.

You wanted ACCESS-FONT to stick to the previous character.
and since FONT already was sticky, you made ACCESS the
same way thus making all uses of ACCESS before punctuation
unworkable so that one special case would perform logically.

This is a plot to get me committed, right?

Bruce is right, despite (?) his manner of stating the case.?
I'm happy for the language people, but I now wonder how
many triple-access strings I have in my lessons!?
Surely a convention can be found which will make font-
letter-access-font stick together, but NOT (something)-
access-(something other than font)! PLEASE!!!

As Judy has related, when the backwards-looking FONT was
introduced, ERASE was fixed to handle FONT...ACCESS-FONT
strings properly as units, but EDIT was not, making the
ACCESS-FONT useless to languages (and leaving them with
as earlier problem that ACCESS-FONT was invented to solve).
Recently, EDIT was changed to ignore FONT boundaries alto-
gether, and this was found an acceptable solution (this is
what is meant by "the language people like the current
arrangement"). The problem Bruce points out is the result
of a different, preceding change, which could be rectified
without changing EDIT's attitude toward FONT boundaries.
(Although, ultimately, I think everyone agrees, EDIT and
COPY should join ERASE in handling FONT...ACCESS-FONT
strings properly as units.)

Random numbers:

        After an evening and a day with Knuth, Chapter 3,
I have implemented a random number function for PLATO.
Run lesson

                    for random integers in any range.
Read or copy unit genrand in lesson wjh1 for details.

(Knuth shows that a random number generator 'selected
at random' has a high probability of very short cycles.
By following his guidelines, my generator has a cycle
??of 2ˆ4ˆ7 and other non-degenerate properties.)

   The pseudo-random number generator implemented in the
system has been run through extensive tests for
serial and pair-wise correlation. For any truly
serious use of random numbers, of course, a user
should run THOSE SPECIFIC TESTS (runs, triplets,
whatever) that are the crucial ones to his work and
develop a generator that meets the necessary criteria.

---------- response 2
  05/23     11.13     michael       english

The problem is that the system needs a SEEDABLE random
number generator so that simulations can repeat a run
of data over and over, modifying only the simulation var-
-iables. The system -randu- has met most of my needs for
non-repeatable random sequences, but often repeatable runs
are desired. Everyone I know who does such things has had
to develop their own, and whereas creating a seedable
function is fairly trivial, testing it for randomness is
not.

---------- response 3
  05/23     12.05     whansen       csa

The random number generator in -wjh1- unit -genrand-
is seedable. Merely replace the assignment
        x?clock
with    x?any seed .

Blomme:
1. Yes, any random number generator should be tested before
"serious" use.
2. Most PLATO applications are not "serious" in the same
sense as a monte carlo simulation. As long as the cycle
is long and no obvious patterns appear the student will not
detect non-randomness.
3. According to Knuth's method, the random generator in
-wjh1- meets the pairs test and serial correlation tests.

---------- response 4
  05/23     17.00     blomme       s

   You must have had spectacular access to some computer
to run those tests...taking chi squares on the distribution
of chi squares over a series of many runs takes a good
deal of computer time. we spent probably a week or two
when a problem was noticed with the old generator in order
to do the "best" we could for machine/tests we were running.
   "Seedability" is a reasonable type thing to desire,
and we can probably make this available--but will probably
not be available immediately since currently everyone
on the system shares the same generator/seed.

As some form of reasonable substitute, it might be nice
to be able to turn off the coordinate display because
there are sometimes when all you wish to do is design
a display by "eye" and not worry about the actual screen
locations. Anyway, since SD is fairly quick anyway, if
you did need to know some rough idea of the coordinates
you could just go back to the block and look at the
generated code and return to SD.

        Or another such substitute might be to have a
special keypress which would give the current position
(such as the current update keys f and g.) Also when
you change mode (draw, rdraw) would be the only time that
this information would be shown.

        I would like to know though why it is necessary
to erase the two whole line at the bottom of the screen
when these two statistics are shown?

?         The apparent advantage of loading a charset via?the "C" option from the author mode page instead of
from the lesson itself is that you don't need to change?your security code or your lesson-last-edited flag. How-
ever, I notice today that the "C" option now changes?your lesson-last-edited flag to the name of the lesson
which has the charset. Could this flag be kept intact,?and so preserve the stated advantage of "C"?¬??¬??--paul

As far as the part about the advantage of loading the
charset into your terminal from the C option on the
author mode page, it does allow you to look at the
charset if you know the name of it in a lesson which
has the security codes so arranged so that you cannot
look at it normally. But I dont see any difference in
loading the charset from the editor (to say, in a lesson)
or from the C option. Both allow you to look at the
charset and matter of fact, if you didnt want to be taken
to the index page  for the charset you can just load it
and be taken back to the directory page of the lesson with
less problems. Having the last lesson name preserved is
nice but since the maximum a lesson name can be is 10 chars
I dont see where typing the lesson name is so difficult.

Many user groups have developed a large number of lessons.
Most of these groups have developed or are developing
their own system for collecting data concerning the use
of the lessons. Such items as number of references,
time spent in each lesson, number of times completed,
etc. are most often included.

Wouldn't it be nice if the system would provide this
data collection service? And wouldn't it be nice if
it was done before a large number of similar routines
were written by individual groups this summer?

One way to do this would be similar to the keeping
of student data. There would be a new command "useron"
which would indicate that use data would be kept.
The tag could contain the name of a "userset" or
"userfile" in which the data would be stored.

How about it systems??

A very general purpose "files manager" is now available
(and has been debugged and improved -- many thanks to all
who contributed suggestions).

Some of the features:
1. passworded entry, if desired - 3 security levels.
2. names in list can be classified into (max. of) 10
   user-specified types, and types can be selectively
   displayed in any combination.
3. ability to attach 2 types of records to (file) names
   stored in the list - one record is restricted access.
4. ability to edit the list or any records attached
   at any time.

The best way to find out more about it is to set up
one of your own... see lesson "bork" blocks "manager1"
and "manager2" (author mode) for more details.

It requires a dataset (any size) and must be -use-d.

     I would like to see a system feature that would
let you inspect the charset _currently_ loaded in your
terminal, possibly also giving the lesson and charset
name (if this information is indeed available). There
have been many times where a charset was in my terminal
that I needed to find out what chars were in it.
     I realize this could probably be done by editing
an empty charset (maybe), but this still wouldn't tell

It wouldnt take much time to write a simple unit to
plot the characters which are currently in the alternate
character slots but I dont think there is any way to
tell what lesson and character set was last loaded into
the terminal since I know that sometimes I have sat down
at a terminal which has been turned off and upon testing
the alternate character set (by pressing the shifted-micro
or FONT key for all you key buffs) found a strange and
foreign charset loaded in the terminal. It would therefore
be pretty hard to keep the name of a loaded charset around.

     I realize that such a feature would simply dump
all 128 (126 if you're picky) slots, but the main point
of my suggestion is that a way to find the charset
id of the loaded charset would be very useful.
     It's possible that this info isn't kept in useable
(i.e. lesson name and charset name) form, but rather as
a hashed number stored in the terminal. I would appreciate
a systems comment on this, however.

     The option in "testor" does indeed show all the
chars, but trying to match that display with the associated
charset slots is difficult indeed. I would like to see
a format similar to the current charset editor's.

I would guess that the systems people would not go for the
idea of telling you lesson name, charset name because you
could use such a feature to determine lesson names in
various packages (i.e., sample), and as we all know that is
a no-no. It would be rather difficult (read impossible) to
determine which lesson names, charset names an author can
legally be shown. Of course, they could show you the name
if your change/inspect codes matched, but I think disk
accesses could be used as an excuse there. Charset names
alone would seem to me to be the best compromise. This
would not disclose lesson names, but would allow an author
to distinguish among various charsets(with different names).

As for the point of seeing the altfont memory chars, it is
easy code to write yourself. There probably is some lesson
around with the proper display.

Because Sangamon State is a new school, it does not have
established policy yet in some areas. I'm on our faculty
senate, and would like to introduce legislation about
workload adjustments for people teaching courses through
PLATO.
   This is the question: if a faculty member has a course
set up in PLATO, will he get credit for it on his workload?
I.E., does it count as a full-time course (1/3 load, or
whatever)? I would like to hear from faculty at schools
which have estableished rules for this, and/or from faculty
who =se schools have no rules, but who think there should be
some. Preventing PLATO courses from counting on the load
could be a way for schools to raise their student =/faculty
stats, but is it fair to the teacher ? I'd appreciate
your thoughts....

---------- response 1

If the faculty member is also expected to develop the
lesson material used in the course, the question becomes
one of a GREATLY increased course load rather than
a reduced course load. In many areas, the extensive
use of PLATO changes the nature of the responsibilities
of the staff, but often does not result in a reduction
in the total time spent, although the quality of the
instruction may be improved by the use of well
designed instructional material on PLATO.

Hinton, would you please clarify what you mean by a course
on plato? If you mean a complete course solely on plato you
may run into problems with amount of material available
and/or the material presented on plato not fitting the
material presented in the classroom version. This leads to
the previous response.
        On the other hand if the class uses plato as a
part of the class (1 hr. or so a week) then there will be
material in a number of curriculums. This is the method
utilized in the Chicago Community Colleges at the present
time. The teachers workloads are not affected by this usage
Teachers receive the same amount of credit for both plato
and non-plato classes.

Well, I can conceive of either situation occurring, though
I must admit that using plato for part of a course is more
likely---that's ==how most of the things I am writing will
be. In that situation, if, say, students are spending _x_
hours per week on plato: isn't that rather like lab hours
for science faculty ? and shouldn't faculty get credit on
their load the way science fac get credit for lab super-
vision ?

On the other hand, a colleague and I are developing a course
that =, when done, will be taken by all entering Communi-
cations majors, perhaps for 1 hour credit, perhaps for 2.
Shouldn't someone in Commun. get credit for teaching that,
if he/she oversees it, debugs, collects data, etc ?

You are approaching many different ideas in your note. Maybe
if I explain how things are set up here in Chicago it will
give a point of reference.
        Basically plato is utilized as another resource, the
library, a-v material, etc. It is generally used in place of
a regular class session. Therefore teachers don't get credit
for another class session over and above their normal load.
        Supervision of those students who come in and use
the terminals outside of class time falls to the site
directors and their assistants. Rarely do they do any work
on a lesson unless it was one of theirs. They do have the
ability to manage many of the courses which utilize the site
along with the teachers and the subject matter corrdinators.

At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, there
are currently no official rules regarding course loads as
related to plato course. In other words, whether a
professor teaches 3 lectures per week, or teaches two
lectures per week and has the students on plato one hour
per week, the course load is credited the same.?
Some people here find this obviously inquitable, but
several things impede change: (1) There is, of course, a
natural lag in changing such administrative practices.
(2) Perhaps even more important, it is not obvious HOW
the practice should change; as Stan Smith pointed out,
during the development stage, the actual load a person
carries is actually higher; and even after that stage
has passed, administration of the plato effort and more
personal attention to slower students could easily make
up the difference in a professor's load.

In the VERY long run, it seems clear that some courses
might be delivered mainly by PLATO, in which case there
should be a rise in teacher productivity. Presumably
this will result in a reshuffling of jobs more than in
a decrease in the number of teaching jobs. As has happened
with increases in industrial productivity, new markets
would surely open up -- markets that could not be exploited
as long as education was so labor-intensive. But it will
take us a long time to get there. In most areas the
PLATO materials just don't exist to make a marked change
in the number of students a teacher can handle.

to paraphrase old abe, you can't please 'em all and
if you express definitive views you are often going
to encounter hostility-- it is unfortunate that
people frequently are unable to limit their animosity
to the issues and extend their feelings to the personality
who has expressed the point they disagree with. usually
those who attack on personal grounds have the least
evidence to support their views and when cornered by
valid arguments, simply lash out any way they can.

does anyone think you can learn much about someone's
personality through an exchange of notes on a limited
group of subjects? .

it appears that the press command puts its pause in front
of the actual key echoing. try this code --

pause
press  key
showo  key,3

and press 2 different keys in rapid succession; the 2nd
key (if you're fast enough) will be the one pressed.

it seems to me that the pause in the press command ought
to lock out intervening keys; it was a surprise to
find out that i could get more than one key in after a
pause command.

press key

does not insure that -key- will be pressed before execution
resumes. For example:

press  funkey  $$ begin pressing funkey
pause          $$ intercept funkey press
press  next    $$ begin pressing next
showo  key,3   $$ shows o200=funkey; next still
c                 pending
pause          $$ intercept next press
showo  key,3   $$ shows o202=next

In general, your lesson won't be aware of the press until
the timeslice ends.

You don't understand, Read the oiginal note more carefully.
The key that the press command presses is the _second_ key
pressed. In the example, "a" broke throught the pause, but
"b" was the key pressed, apparently because "b" broke
through a system-generated -pause- inside the press
command.
A systems response to the original note would be
appreciated.

---------- response 3

I'll hazard a guess:

When you press a key, *key* gets updated, whether or not
a -pause-is pending. This is helpful when you're in a
tight loop and branching on, say, the STOP key, but you
can't do a -pause-. So....

IF you press a key at the -pause-, then press another
key BEFORE the -press- is executed, *key* contains the
NEW key value, not the old one.

And, as Bruce suggested, this can happen if your timeslice
ends before the -press-, since *key* will be updated then.

Bob and John, you are correct. The -press- command does
do its -return- before evaluating the tag of the command
and doing the press. (You reasoned very well with few
clues as to what was happening.)

It would be possible to to fix this, but I doubt if
it is urgent enough to be kludged in before major
changes are done in the internal time-slicing structure.

to do them.)

No. Please ask the author of the lesson to remove the
"jumpout sample". My feeling is that such statements
should in general be removed from lessons, partly because
lesson sample may someday go away (replaced by some kind
of catalog) and partly because of the circuitous paths
opened up by "jumpout sample". Hopefully we will this
summer finally get around to giving all users an option
in signing off to sign in again without typing name and
course, which would make it possible for a student to make
another choice, even after hitting shift-STOP. This would
take care of the browser who hits shift-STOP to leave a
lesson but does not want to sign all the way out (an option
already available to students under the system router).

Bruce: Please clarify....do you mean a user (any type) will
be able to shift-stop out of a lesson and be taken to a
page reminiscent of the old 'student mode' page in order to
make additional choices? Or, as I suspect, do you mean
the _routed_ student (not sys. router) will be taken to
either an index (something like the 'shift-stop to sign off
for now' message in use w/the sys. router now)?

---------- response 3
  05/29     09.45     b sherwood       s

Similar to present system router: when a student presses
shift-STOP, he would get a choice, something like
"shift-STOP to sign off, DATA to sign in again without
typing name, course, and password". Then if the student
presses DATA it would be EXACTLY as tho he had signed
out and signed in again, but he would be spared all the
extra sign-in typing. As you can see, a multiple signin,
even unrouted, would be much more pleasant to use.....

cannot copy-a-block the lesson. Why?

Harry G. Mairson

---------- response 1
  05/29     08.48     alan       reading

The restriction has nothing to do with PLATO policy (a few
months ago you _could_ copy-a-block with just the inspect
code). Rather, the file must be attached to the user doing
the copy-a-block. This means that no one else can write
on that disk space while it is attached. It is undesirable
to allow someone who only has the inspect code to prevent
someone who has the change code from editting the lesson,
thus the restriction.

Tried to see the curriculum statistics for a course, every
time I pressed that number I was bounced out to the "last

anything else in the course.
It turns out the instructor file had been destroyed, when
another file was attached the statistics were available.

without any router being hooked up. Anybody clear this up?

As long as records thinks your course has an instructor

info page) it will try to get the instructor file.
If you clear that entry you should be able to see

For anybody that is curious...
        This morning, a friendly air-conditioning man from
the U of I physical plant dropped in to oil some fans
on the roof. Naturally, he threw the switch that turned
off the air-conditioning equipment for the computer room.
Luckily, out automatic back-up air-conditioner switch-over
equipment switched to the other system, and things were
fine, for a few minutes. Then, the air-conditioning man,
realizing that he had turned off something, came back and
switched the original air-conditioning system on. That
did some bad things to BOTH systems, and it wasn't until
a while later that another air-conditioning man arrived,
figured out what was going on, and got one system to run.

        We then proceeded to turn on the 400 cycle power
used to run the computer. When that was attempted, however,
part of the Motor-Generator blew up, and we decided to

switch to a stand-by unit, That, however, didn't work (of

fixed.
        Meanwhile, back on the fourth floor (the Motor-
Generators are in the basement, which caused problems until
we found some walkie-talkies), the air-conditioning had gone
out again. Luckily, the air-conditioning man had stuck
around, so that got fixed relatively quickly.
        Finally, the computer was running again, and after
our engineers got it working correctly, PLATO was loaded.

       This report is slightly abbreviated. I've left
out the parts about the blown circuit breakers and the

  05/29     15.41     alan m       block

I would like to propose the following suggestions for Tutor:

1)A 'rat' command - "relative at" to replace "at wherex?d,
wherey+c". Tag should be "d,c" (d and c are numbers). Re-
lative commands are not without precedent (ex:rdraw). The
rat command should be embedable.

2)Allow -at- to be embeded in the -erase- command. I am not
sure how this would compare in efficency to the present
method but it would make a lesson with a lot of selective
erases easier to follow.

3)Make the -writec- command paragraphable. For example, why
couldn't: writec n1,¬oat,505¬1xxx,,
          writec n2,¬oat,606¬1xxx,,
be replaced by:writec ni,¬oat,505¬1xxx,,
n2,xxx,,
       Alan M. Malakoff

---------- response 1
  05/29     16.48     b sherwood       s

1) I don't quite see the advantage of -rat- in terms of
typing, whereas an -rdraw- may have dozens of arguments.
 i can see in the very long run that there might be some
point in specifying that successive graphics be relative,
since a more intelligent terminal might accept specs in
terms of relative addresses.
2) Many of us are esthetically uncomfortable with
proliferation of embedded things. Not entirely rational
of us, I agree.
3) Your -writec- suggestion, if I understand it correctly,
is untenable. There may be dozens of arguments of a
-writec-, which take more than one line to specify, so
successive lines are continuations of the first, not parts
of a paragraph of some kind.

---------- response 2
  05/29     16.55     galcher       uimatha

As far back as I can remember, someone once a month or
so has suggested the embedded at in an erase comand and
always with the same answer. (Which by the way, is that
it is not worth the time to put it in.)

        But as for the paragraphable writec, as far as
I know the writec is paragraphable but not with more than
one variable. This makes for ease in reading the operands
of the writec and also it helps when you cannot fit all of
an argument on one line. Say you have the following:
*
writec errcond,You have not finished the exercise,
       You have finished all but one exercise,
       Congratulations! You have finished the exercises!,,
*
This wouldn't fit on one line if the 120 character limit is
still in effect in the editor, And not only that, it is
much easier to read in this form.

   I would guess you "notice" wrong; the two argument

pseudo-random fraction (which is between 0 and 1). No

talking about a rand_p_, then updating appropriate flags

Better yet would be a manual reload feature. This would
solve your problem and in addition would allow one to
get around the problem of reloading in those cases which
the system is fooled by monitor mode and transmission

it might be better just to reload only the characters that
had been currently edited on BACK1.

---------- note 82 release
  06/01     17.03     eland       csa

Hypothetical sequence of events:?
1. Student in lesson A executes a "reserve" command.
2. Student then does jumpout to lesson B.
3. Student presses SHIFT STOP while in lesson B.?
Question: will the system properly release the common as it
would if the SHIFT STOP had been pressed in lesson A???
The basic issue here is whether it is possible for a student
to "get away" while holding a reservation. While developing
and testing some new code, I had forgotten to include a
"release" on one of the possible exits from my lesson. The
student signed completely off the system, yet the common was
still reserved by him. The only way I could get it released
was to sign that student back on and get him to execute a
"release". This strikes me as a potentially serious
problem. How can we preempt a reservation which is held by
someone who will never release it??

lesson expression,completed,x
is rejected. How about allowing this form? It seems
perfectly reasonable; "x" would mean "make no change in the
lesson completion flag".?

"expression" above, but coding "x" is much more straight-

Hey! here's something I didn't know....

Did you know that a -pause- command can be continued
like the -calc- or -write- command? For example, you
can say

pause (this is a blank tag)
      .75
      3
      n47

and when it's executed, you get

blank pause, then
.75 sec pause, then
3 sec pause, then
pause for (n47) seconds!

Continued commands are (unfortunately, on occasion) a basic

---------- response 2
  06/02     14.37     friedman       csa

With commands that have no specific convention for
continuation lines (like -pause-), a blank command field
is interpreted by the condensor to mean repeat the same
command. This is what you are seeing; those lines are
taken to be three separate -pause- commands, not one
continued command.?
Commands allowing for continuation are -write-, -calc-,
all commands with expected conditional forms, and
I don't know what else....you get the idea.

---------- response 3
  06/02     17.37     bowery       rhrc

Sorry, I don't get the idea. It seems that your definition
of "continued" is slightly apart from the one I have run
into while dealing with TUTOR jargon.

  The idea that a -write- is continued in the same way that
a -calc- is continued seems strange. ie:
write aaaa
      aaaa

*¬+
write aaaa
write aaaa  $$ are different whereas
calc  n1?n1+1
      n2?n2+1

*¬+
calc  n1?n1+1
calc  n2?n2+1       $$ are equivalent

  The most common usage of "continued" on the PLATO system
has been to indicate whether you need type in the command
feild more than once. PSO's comments on this'

---------- response 4
  06/02     19.54     blomme       s

   My standard distinction is between "continued"
commands (like write, calc, etc.) and "implied" commands
...if a command cannot be continued, but the next line
is blank, then the same command is "implied" again.
(P.S. I've never much liked the "time saving" feature
provided by "implied" commands because of the strange
and confusing effects it can often also provide.)

---------- response 5
  06/03     10.08     frye       research

But a -pause- command CAN be continued! And I can think
of at least one case where this method of condensing could
cause problems...

you can say:
pause  .75,keys=a,b,c,d,e
        f,g,h,i,j,k,l $$ continued line

and you can say:
pause   .75
        keys=a,b,c,d,e,f,g $$ implied NEW -pause-

but you CANNOT say:
pause .75,
      keys=a,b,c,d,e,f,g, $$ where "keys=" is a continu-
ation! And suppose instead of ".75," you have a long long
calculation (rare, true), and there isn't space for "keys="?
 How do you continue that -pause-? I am well aware of the
"implied command", and am disappointed that it cannot be
consistent in the current scheme.??Dave

---------- response 6
  06/03     14.54     friedman       csa

Hmmmmmmmmm......good point. I guess -pause- was NOT
a "continuable" command before the "keys=" feature came
along; now, if it acts like you say, it seems to be
inconsistent.?
Unfortunately, for those commands that ARE explicitly
contiunable (like calc, write, etc.), there is not a
really consistent definition of what the continuation
implies. For example, in -write-, a continued line implies
a CR; in writec, if a line ends with a delimiter (¬, or ,)
a continuation line does not imply aCR, but if a line ends
otherwise, a CR IS implied. It's all useful, but can be
confusing.

We have an application which would benefit from the
following capability:
   writein variable, text-ow/embed¬1
which would execute a write command but store the
generated text into memory beginning at the location
specified by "variable".
        Others might find this useful for generating
messages to store in common or a data set.

---------- response 1
  06/02     23.17     bowery       rhrc

  Perhaps a better implementation of this would be a
command which would set a flag for all text generating
commands to divert their internal code " output" to a
set fo variables. Thus any text generating commands, ie:
the -show-, -write-, or -plot- type commands, would
automatically "output" in internal code to a set of
variables.
  If my understanding of the way the text stuff works
is generally accurate, all of these codes are presently
written onto a bunch of "variables" anyhow (with some
pointers) which is then passed to the outputing routines
  The diversion of this data could be extreamly useful
to MANY applications I can think of.

While wondering through the vastness of AIDS yesterday, I
came up with (I thought) an idea which might warrant some
opinions.

        How about an option in the editor which allows you
to type the name of the command (with specs okspell of
course) and upon acceptance of this command, the bottom
3 lines of the screen would be erased and a very short
synopsis of the command syntax would be shown. I cant
remember how many times I have gone paging through AIDS
for sometimes up to 4 or 5 minutes looking for the syntax
that I wanted.

        This of course does represent some problems such
as what happens if you have a command like jumpout which
has many forms. In this case, a possible cure could be
to show one of the forms and have the option of NEXT to
see more or BACK to return to the editor.

Re: comment by s stone - How expensive is AIDS= then? I am
suggesting a similar effort.

Re: comment by fuller -yes, but that is exactly the point
I am making. Possibly you didnt read what I had said
correctly. The idea is: say you dont want to fish thru all
the info on a command just to find the two lines of the
description that you were looking for. Then having a two
or three line description appear at the bottom of the
screen which would tell you exactly what you wanted to
know might be a little more helpful.

        I'm not trying to suggest that AIDS is not a
good source of information but sometimes it is a bit much
to have to go thru all the indexes and the background
on a command when all you want is syntax.

Matter of fact the referenc to the book "TUTOR Users Memo"
is what I had in mind. When you go home to write some code
because you're eyes are tired, you can still use the book
"The TUTOR Language" as a 'take-home' AIDS (though it is
slightly outdated by now), but when you come back to
PLATO, you cannot refer to an on-system TUTOR Users Memo.
You have to go thru all the description in AIDS. So
basically what I am suggesting is a concise form of the
users memo quickly accessible from the editor.

Every time I use the Q option from the editor, typing in
a command name from within a block, it takes me right to
the page listing the command and its syntax. SHIFT-NEXT
The idea sounds only marginally faster than the present
method, and certainly not of crucial importance.

Ok. Maybe what i am thinking of is the fact that if you've
been sitting at a terminal for a couple of hours and need
the one command syntax, by the time you get back from AIDS
you may have forgotten the thing you went to look for.
Having a short synopsis on the page I guess is easier than
writing it down on paper...

I also find the command write-ups in AIDS generally
excellent and convenient. When all I want is the syntax,
I refer to the Tutor Users Memo entitled "Summary of
Tutor Commands and System Variables" by Elaine Avner,
which has been mentioned in earlier responses. This is a
small book (blue), about the size of the folded printout of
a modest-length lesson. I always keep it with me when
programing, and like it especially because I can consult
it while keeping the problematic code on the screen at
the same time. Between this and the direct access to the
AIDS command write-ups, as mentioned by michael/english,
I find all my needs well covered. I cannot imagine that
the "helpop AIDS" requested would be worth the enormous
effort it would require.

As to the Summary manual being "slightly out of date",
I personally keep mine up to date by writing in the
updates which Elaine puts into Aids (currently option u
from the main Aids index). Some of the more extensive
updates, I have copied on the Varian copier and simply
tucked into the back of the booklet. But I almost never
sit down at a terminal to author without my updated Summary
close at hand.?

There are indeed some commands in AIDS which do not give

We are trying to make it so that "Qcommand" will always

The system functions would take space in the system
that most people would not be using. By defining the
arguments in your own define it cuts down on that type
of waste. However, consider if a function is used a
lot, then there would be many copies wasting ECS space,
Another consideration is that cpu time is used much more
when one uses one's own defined function. Thus, I would
think that now since ECS is lightened (not necessarily
permanently) cpu time is more important, as well as user
time in finding the arguments in aids ("an obscure lesson"?
(I hope pso folk arent offended).

Before those are added we need to think (again) about

As a suggestion, damon, I would recommend NOT looking at

If you need something to look at to help you learn about

examine the sections in AIDS on calculations (section k),
display techniques (section l), systematic lesson design

        Dear David:

        The best, and certainly the most imaginative
programming on the system is contained within games such
as Damon listed. Your rational as to why more Goonwar's
are not desirable is certainly valid, but a look at said
programming, and someone that is willing to answer
questions will help this aspiring programmer to programming
greatness. A look at a working program is better than

I have a suggestion which would greatly aid in the

an addition to the -define- statement.?
define setname,previous?
which would cause the new define set to be added to
any previous define set, no matter what the name.
Present -use- structures -use-d by multiple lessons
require either that the author of the -use- blocks

has anyone ever considered (or tried to implement) an
option on plato so that people who had trouble seeing in general(poor vision handicapped)could type in some code which
would expand sections of the screen(perhaps in quarters) to several times the size characters are now to make
reading on plato possible ( or easier). also, have the characters that are being used now ever been
studied so as to determine how easily they can be read? (this is easily determined since it is probably related
to the number of lines per inch that are needed to distinguish any two characters form each other)
it would be a good idea to design a character set which was
the easiest to read given the restrictions which the dots and size of the characters impose.
im sure these characters would have applications even for well sighted personsin facilitatings ease of reading, speed,
and reduction in eye fatigue.

The matter of visibility of characters has indeed been
carefully examined during design and several subsequent
years of use (resulting in several modifications of the
standard character set). The brilliance and high contrast
of the plasma display makes these characters much more
discriminable than would be the case for printed letters on
paper (though, as you may know, light characters on dark
backgrounds tend in general to be more easily seen than
the reverse case). Several "legally blind" authors have
used terminals for several years without undue hardship
since the display is easier to read than most normal
printed text. Al Avner (PLATO Ed. Evaluation
and Research Group)

        When you've had more than seven blocks in a lesson

I'm not really sure about this so someone who knows will
probably correct me, BUT...

I think the second number (...of ¬_$_) refers to the total
available space "reserved" for your lesson. As an analogy,
if you have code in only five blocks, "f" and "g" are not
displayed but are still available for you to put code into
at any time. Thus the ¬$ refers to POTENTIAL (not necessarily
actually used) space.

According to what Dave just told me, he had a regular
14-block 1-parter before the changeover, but had less
than 7  blocks used. After the change it said part 1 of 1,
he thinks. Then he added blocks to go to part 2, and got
the blocks, and the editor then said part ¬$ of 2, and
stayed that way even when the lesson was pared back down.

I think it was probably a bug in the editor at that time.

   I think the report is most likely confused and
that there was no bug in the editor. Is there ANYthing
that anyone else can currently see which is not consistent
or does not work as advertised? (Sorry--these things
were checked in hundreds and hundreds of cases and have
since been used thousands and thousands of times
with no errors--and files were NOT shortened in any
case during conversion; all former 1 part lessons became
AT LEAST 2 part lessons). It IS possibly that the lesson
directory or lesson itself has been screwed up on the disk--
in this case the error should be quite evident and
repeatable and perhaps other strange things should be
happening with the lesson as well.

To (hopefully) one who has fair amount of control IN PLATO

I am rather disturbed to find so many unauthorized users abusing the system by paying games during prime time. I am
speaking primarily concerning the 14-odd children whom
I have just counted playing games, all of whom are under 12
years of age, so it would seem.
It enangers me primarily due to the fact that there are
no doubt people who would like to get on PLATO IV as an
author, or at all, to learn about the system, as was my case.

---------- response 1

As I was sayig, this seems to be poor control on the part
of the operators and those parents giving their children
access to PLATO IV. Remember, this is an expensive
item, and nota toy to keep one's children occupied.
Why isn't there a policy that will teach persons to
program in exchange for that peson programming in return?

---------- response 2
  06/05     16.32     berger       mfl

Mr. Rowlen,

     First, you say that these people are unauthorized.
What gave you that impression? I know several of the
people that you are referring to personally, and they
have as much right to use the system as you do. Many
of them are working on legitimate projects.

  Secondly, you say that their parents are responsible
for the signons, and that the operators fail to enforce 
the rules. You find fault with the wrong people. The
operators have enough to do without making thorough
checks to see it everyone is using a legitimate record,
and the games certainly aren't hurting anyone while there
are no classes in session, extra ECS, and spare terminals.

     If the problem is as acute as you seem to think,
please allow me to point out that you have played games
excessively during prime-time in the past few days.

   I think that the comment has much basis in fact.
Personally, I am very much bothered by _anyone_ who is loud
and annoying. This includes college age as well as
high school age users.

  Again, personally, I do not object so much to the
people in 165 playing games as much as their being
loud and unruly.

  I.E. Running from one terminal to the other seeing
how the other is doing in a game/lesson ... speaking in
a loud voice (yelling) from one terminal to another
informing the other gameplayer of his/her status.

  The operators are pretty much insulated from the
problem being across the hall, and not able to hear
much. If things get too loud, perhaps you might come
across the hall and tell us. It IS a valid complaint.

I think that it might be helpful to zero the 150 'student'
variables attached to an author in student mode one page
later. That means not before getting into edit mode by
pressing next. I know that n1 is used for the lesson name
but if we know what have to be overwriten, we can still go
back in to the lesson more like the student does (also go to
another lesson with the n variables like a student will do.)

I think it would be a good idea for a flag to be set some-
where (perhaps in course records to alert the director)
when there are a certain number of incorrect attempts to
gain access to a user record. Also, to discourage such
behavior it might be a good idea to 'freeze' the terminal
in question after that number of attempts for a certain
(short) period of time. This would probably help to
frustrate such attempts.

There are probably better ways to accomplish discouraging
such individuals, though. If so, let's hear some more

Most people in this discussion link junior authors, kids,

while there are a large number of possible words, the
astute thieves undoubtedly look over your shoulder and
from the characters they can see you type, they narrow
the possibilities. as has been said before many times,
you can minimize the possibility of damage from a stolen
record by:
* always scrambling your security code word before you
leave the system
* transfering and deleting any sensitive personal notes
*
*
then the information on where/when the record was last used
should tip you off that it was pirated, no harm could be
done, and it's easy enough to change your password.
*
on many other systems, ie. the old medical CAI network
called Lister Hill Network, your password is put in by
the system and it takes time and a phone call to change
it... you can imagine the pirated entries that cam
result with that scheme.

1. "scrambling your password" before leaving the system
   (mentioned in an earlier response) means typing S from
   the author mode page and typing in giberish so that
   anyone stealing your record at least won't be able to
   get into your lessons and do any damage there.
2. "password" are all too frequently none too hard to
   figure out. First names, middle names, first and middle
   etc comprise some of the most popular. This fact, I
   would suggest, if the "thief" has just limited
   personal knowledge of the author, would help to limit
   the range of possiblities to the hundreds or thousands,
   not the millions or so suggested by brand. And there

   At least for quite some time to come, the answer is NO--
both because of the way in which the "gone" condition is
handled and because, really, if someone is going to be
away it is to the best interests of the system (and maybe
even to the person!) to have all notes "processed" and
cleared away. The note "save" option is always available
for moving information that was being saved in notes to
a lesson so that your notes can be emptied.
   If it is essential to you to receive notes from
certain people then make special arrangements so that
those particular people can leave messages for you
somewhere; if you just like getting mail from everyone,
then let it accumulate (if you think the rest of the
people in your course are of a kindly nature)!

And systems' point of view is that if you _have_ to do
something like that, it is better to tell people to leave
their pnotes in somebody else's file, which would likely
be active anyway, rather than to leave notes in a course
note file that fills very quickly. It is not the case that
if zweig, for example, has 18 note spaces, and iu has 48
students, iu's notes file contains 18?48 spaces! The
file contains more like 6?48 spaces, and filling up files
for missing users robs the course of note space. See?

Simple.

        The charset editor is located in lesson -charset-
and when you return from lesson -charset-, you enter the
editor the same as if you had pressed NEXT on the author
mode page. So, if you weren't last editor of the lesson
then you would receive that message. This also happens
(at least to me) if I am not the last editor and go in
to edit a common in that lesson...and does not update the
fact that you last edited that lesson. That is probably
because of the fact that if you execute a lesson with a
common, you are(sometimes) allowed to change the common and
it would be ridiculous to expect that the last editor flag
should be reset every time someone changes common.

how you show the letters to type on the keyset and how
you type letters by an arrow for examples.
I very much did not like waiting so long for partial
screen erasures.....You can and should shorten this.
I think if you want others to use this lesson, you should
mention that the student should type his signon (as
opposed to "family name") I noticed that the "long"
is a bit short (is it on a variable tied to the signon?).

Just a few points:

The lesson is intended for a PLATO lab at the U of I. A
monitor or instructor will be available; if a student
gets stuck, a message appears for him to CALL YOUR
INSTRUCTOR. The program sends a message to the monitor
telling which student needs help.

The vocabulary choice is not arbitrary. For example,
"continue" is learned faster than "go on" (a verb +
preposition). This logic is used unless there is no other
way to present the concept. If you have alternatives,
let us know and we will seriously consider them.
Be assured, however, that the ESL staff which wrote
this lesson includes two theoretical linguists, two
pedagogues, two experienced ESL teachers, one creative
writer, and, of course, some good programmers.

A definite "bug" exists in the "Type your name" section.
If the student types the wrong answer, the message is
recieved saying "Type _name_, then press [NE_XT]=_====?ˆ?ˆ____ ????".
If the student does _exactly_ that, typing the letters
in name, the pressing NEXT, what will appear is
        ¬6 ame no
because the first "n" will break the pause used to
erase the name. You can fix this by using
force firsterase
and the eraseu command.

The lesson does a nice job of presenting ideas one at a 
time in a nice clear display. You also do a nice job of
drawing attention to appropriate items. However, the
lesson seems a bit condescending. For example, after the
student has already typed in some responses, such as name,
you show which keys to press to type "yes". I also am

Glare on the terminal screen has caused many administrative

Ligneous Dimensional Glare Eliminator*
and the
Papyrous Mobile Glare Interceptor.*?
The second of these two devices consists of three sides
of a cardboard box, tied onto the front of the terminal
with string. It reduces glare on the screen, but tends
to reduce the utility of ther terminal when two people
are working.
The first is now univerally applied. It consists of 15"
of 2?4, set on end under the back legs of the terminal
to tilt it so the screen is vertical.

My design included a vertical front of the terminal
and the plasma panel was recessed into this 2" at the
bottom and 4" at the top. This provided a fair amount
of glare reduction while keeping the panel at a very
easily readable angel. This recessing also included
space for the touch panel.

Warner, the 2?4 is officially known at CERL as the
precision angle adjuster terminal modification kit.

The new terminal design that Jack Stifle is working
on currently resides in a case with a vertical front.
It seems to eliminate most of the glaring problems.

if you've ever sat at a desk opposite a low vertical
display, you'll understand that that won't do it
either. the military has experimented (how about
some data, san diegans?) for years with radarscopes
and when i last looked at that stuff the best results
were obtained in rooms with subdued lighting coming
from ceiling fluorescent lights, baffled with egg crate
like affairs and equipped with polarizing screens. the
polarizers on the displays are then individually rotated
for minimum glare. the over level is quite low-- enough

to prevent dazzling from the display and to find your
way around a room... for writing/reading, small
more intense local spotlights are used(polarized also).
*
seems like a lot of trouble, but if you want to minimize
eye strain, particularly with fiche, it's the way to go.
if you think it's too expen$ive, remember what the terminal
and system costs!

And try to estimate the price of your eyes, too....
But I wonder: couldn't the terminals be slanted less ? Why
was it decided to have them at the present angle ?

---------- response 6

An old rumor has it that the present angle was found to be
 THE ANGLE in a study using radarscopes. It turned out that
the Plato terminals can be (and are) used under much bright-
er conditions than radarscopes can be (or are).

---------- response 7

an aside... as of a few years ago anyway, there was
no evidence whatever that any external strain on the
eyes harms them in any way... that doesn't mean
physical agents of course... but dim light, glare,
failing to wear corrective lenses when you need them,
fine print, orange dots on black backgrounds... etc
shouldn't injure the eyes...
*
it may cause headaches and early fatigue or emotional strain
but the accommodation to light in the eyes is done by
muscles which, while they do not appreciably improve
with use, are not damaged by it either.

To answer the original question--yes, a complete study was
done and recommendations made (including a vertical or
negative slope screen angle) in 1972. It was too late
for the current production run but changes will be
incorporated in the next model. Unfortunately, we cannot
assume that terminals will be ??sed in tailor-made settings
so the terminal itself must be designed to cope with
typical lighting conditions. Al Avner (PEER Group)

How about having it available directly from the author

is not currently being used. It seems the only rationale 
for having it where it is now is because "U" means "user

for Onassis because Jackie is beautiful (?) and Onassis
is short and ugly but rich. The men and women of the

and 2. status of job.

      FELLOW AUTHORS:

  Les' get on the band wagon:

  This afternoon, Gary Michael and myself spent _mucho_ time
tracking down a bug that could have been very easiy traced 
given a trace function that would let you know when the 
contents of a variable was changed. I know it is possible 
to do so, but will it ever be done?.. Debugging in TUTOR
is about the worst thing I can think of in its present 
primitive state. I think there should be strong attempts
in developing more(other than just step) author options in
this respect.
  What I have in mind is something like this:
    TRACE(varchange,n1,n2,n3).
and every time n1,n2,n3 was changed, I would know about 
it.

What is really needed, and hopefully will be forthcoming 
as computer usage goes up this fall is enough cpu power
to allow an author to condense quickly every time a small
change in his code. The vast majority of bugs occur when
one writes a long program without testing it while building 
it up gradually. I am yet to be convinced that the time
saved debugging repays learning how to use fancy

Somehow I think you guys missed the point of the original 
request. Whenever one does indirect addressing a la¬e:

calc a (b)?c(d+2i)
It is difficult to detect that the quantity within the
parentheses is causing the array to write outside of its
intended range, changing the value of some other variable.

Two situations arise: 1) You _know_ that a certain section
of a -calc- is writing out of range; solution is to show 
the values of the arguments; 2) You discover that a var-
iable is getting overwritten, but which line of code is 
causing it is unknown. In both cases, particularly the 
second -- since conflicting defines are often the cause --
the ability to halt execution whenever a certain variable
is changed would enormously aid in debugging.

---------- response 8
  06/11     13.15     shirer       vu

   Condense error diagnostics are now being worked on 
(not by me--hold those cards and letters, folks) and 
hopefully will be improved in near future. After that,
execution error and debug diagnostics will be a natural 
candidate for improvement. If nothing happens in a 
few months, another reminder should be in order.

Hey, systems: how about building in an option in

sentation of a number; or b) specify a segment size to 
go thru a variable segment by segment.

As it is, when one is looking at a common or dataset one
must manually convert to binary first then "mask" the 
60 bit binary for the appropriate segment, then reconvert
the binary segment to octal or decimal. Whew! It sure
would facilitate analysis of segments while in the common
or dataset editor to be able to do this as an option of 
either the specific editor or the term-calc feature.

You might find useful the "varsedit" blocks of lesson

your lesson; they allow (via -term-EDIT) examining and/or 
changing the contents of any variable, including common

if desired. Complete instructions in cslibrary.

If there were an arrow in unit test in the previous example,
and if the student pressed help, he could not return to the 
original arrow by pressing back. Again, it seems to me that 
one press of BACK should take you out of helpop and then the 
second should take you to unit backu.

i guess the problem is that the -concept- machinery cannot

-concept- command. so-called "important" words can never
be "extra" as well in the same -vocab-.

Regarding the erase of the last write or writec when
pressing sucessive "helpop keys":
       How many authors find that the erase has to be
programmed around when doing intricate judging? I do because
the reading group uses the help key as a helpop to replay
an audio message. I have the problem after a judge ignore
on an unacceptable answer and then a "helpop" key press
to replay a message for correct directions.
I wind up putting dumb code like:
at 3201
write $$ one blank
after a write statement that could get redone in mode erase
by the sometines not-so-helpful helpop erase. It sure would
be nice to be able to inhibit that automatic erase feature
of the helpop!

Example of why this would be undesirable:
Insert the word "or" between the embeds below using COPY

write Type ¬0s,n1¬1¬0s,n2¬1.

Press COPY four times to get

write Type ¬0s,n1¬1

type SPACE "o" "r" SPACE, then COPY1. The result is

write Type ¬0s,n1¬1¬ or 0s,n2¬1.

due to the way the COPY key treats ACCESS. Under the
current conditions, such a problem does not occur because
you have to fudge around with the SQUARE key, and you
don't get the invisible access code. I think that I have
made myself clear.

A vote against.
The idea of "U" is to get the user to the start of the
unit in which he is working. If the poor sucker specifies.
"U" in the beginning of a block which contains statements
continued from the previous unit, he should be sent
back a block to the required command, in an ideal system.
Since that isn't practical on the present system, he
should at least get "not found" rather than be shot into
a unit which may have no relevance to the code in which
he was working.

Is there any possiblity that a third state could be

         -1 = lesson completed
          0 = lesson _not_ completed
          1 = completion status unknown ¬A¬A¬A¬A?
Not every lesson bothers to set "ldone". Those which do
could start by setting ldone?0 if the lesson was not
previously completed, and ldone?-1 when the lesson was
properly completed.?
A router would initially set ldone?1, and would thus be
able to distinguish those lessons which _should_ be marked
as completed, and those which will _never_ be marked as
completed.

---------- response 1
  06/13     11.37     michael       english

Excellent idea for us non-system router people. The system
router, however, would still have to return only 0 or -1
as advertised so as not to mess up current programs. The
question is whether *ldone* now fits in only one bit of
student bank, probably necessitating a system-wide conver-
sion of all current student banks. That's not my problem,
though....

---------- response 2
  06/13     13.31     chabay     s

-ldone- is intended only as a two state flag -- either a
lesson has been completed' or it hasn't. Couldn't you
use -lscore- for the kind of flag you want? Since the
system router initializes -lscore- to -1, your lesson
could set it to some other value when you enter the lesson,
and a final value when the lesson is completed.
(Or, if you're using your own router, you can pick any
initial value you like.)

---------- response 3
  06/13     14.43     friedman       csa

No, Ruth, -lscore- won't do, as the same router that
Eland is talking about saves scores, and a lesson might
or might not assign a score; lscore=-1 simply means no
score has been assigned, but any other value means that
a score (of that value) has been assigned. Similarly,
the request is for a value of ldone which will mean
"I don't know", which may be different from "incomplete".

---------- response 4

---------- response 5
  06/16     08.58     eland       csa

It must be quite frustrating to a student to study every
part of a lesson only to find it marked as "incomplete"
by his router lesson. What we need is a way to distinguish
between lessons which will be marked as completed, and those
which will never be marked as such. With this ability, the
router can clearly point out those lessons which need to
be studied until they are finished.?
The router would initially set the completion status of a 
lesson as "unknown." A lesson which sets the completion
flag would set it to "_un_finished" IF the flag had a value
of "unknown" when the lesson was entered (otherwise, the
flag's value would remain unchanged). Upon proper
completion of that lesson, the flag would be set to
"finished."?
On the other hand, a lesson which did not set the completion
flag would leave it with the value "unknown."

---------- response 6
  06/16     09.45     friedman       csa

To elaborate some more:?
If a lesson does not end with -end lesson-, then it must
explicitly execute a -lesson- command to change the ldone
flag. We have many old lessons which do neither.?
We give the student a table of contents, and he can (if he
chooses) execute the lesson in a random way (random from the
lesson author's point of view). So just finishing the last
topic does not imply lesson complete; neither does a request
to leave the lesson (so even if we used -end lesson-, and
thus set the flag, it wouldn't mean anything real).?
It's like the Aids lessons. Granted these are for authors,
and there's no need to set ldone; but how would you set it
if you wanted to? You'd probably set it (for the stuff
built around a given sub-table of contents) when each topic
in that area had an * (meaning completed) next to it.?
(continued next reply)

---------- response 7
  06/16     09.50     friedman       csa
We'd like to take that approach to new lessons, and hope
eventually to incorporate it into old lessons (obviously,
that's a lot of work, and won't happen immediately).?
So in the meantime, there are lessons which don't "know"
whether a student has finished them or not, and for which
neither of the present ldone values is meaningful.
It is misleading to mark a lesson "incomplete", when the
student knows he has been through the whole thing; but
the router can't know he's done it all, because the
lesson is not programmed to make that decision.?
I don't know what would happen if one of these lessons
were used in the system router in the mode "must set ldone
to complete before proceeding to the next lesson"; I
don't have much experience with the system router. But I
imagine the student would never be allowed to go on to
the next lesson.

---------- response 8

That's exactly happens with the systems router, George.
Regretably, I've had _plenty_ of experience with this feature
of "sequence mode" in the systems router; hand re-setting
to start student after blockage is only answer so far.

hardly one of them. This change is not only nice, it
was made (with blinding speed) in response to a user
suggestion. Wonderful! Unless a change is one that
will make me bark my shins if I don't know about it,
I say--Do it now, and tell me about it later!

This question of instant documentation seems absurd to me.
Having gone without the new feature for several years, it
just cannot matter whether people in particular OR people
in general find out how to use it now, or a week from now.
David is absolutely right: let him collect together all
the pieces and make ONE announcement. If along the way it
happens to be convenient for him to install one piece
before all are ready, do him the courtesy to permit him
that freedom. Good Grief!

First, I apologize if I came across as antagonistic.
I didn't mean it as such, merely as a reminder of a
detail left (so far) undone.?
I don't mean this note to be antagonistic either, but
you've got my dander up now, so it may sound that way.?
I appreciate the feature, and the rapidity with which
it was implemented. But Hody's right: it's the
attitude that there are secret things around, and you
have to be "in the know" to use them. He's also
right about the relative effort of writing a brief
announcement (which would have immediately been
applauded), versus writing replies to notes like this

A persistent problem with monitoring is the loading of
the monitorer's and monitoree's charsets. I would like
to suggest that upon entry to monitor mode, both the
charset flags of the monitoree and the monitorer be blanked
in order to allow them to load a new charset in synchrony.
I would also like to suggest that the charset flag of a
person leaving monitor mode be blanked, so that he can
again load the proper charset. This seems to be the only
way for a pair of monitoring terminals to guarantee that
the proper charset will be loaded into each.

There is no way that I want to make a student i am monitor-

already in his terminal every time I try to monitor him.
If you want to make it an option fine, but it should not
be inserted as a required feature of monitoring.?
I would think most instructors would agree with my reluct-
ance to decrease system convenience to students who might
be monitored. If you are monitoring an author, he ought to
be able to figure out an easy way to blank his own charset
flag if it is necessary (or you ought to be able to load
the required charset before starting to monitor).

  Addition/correction to previous "historical note":
as soon as AMS was proposed the limit to binaries was made
8192 in anticipation of the day when it would come into 
operation (its "files" being 8192 long). The use of 
shift-register memory no longer seems the most desirable
direction to proceed in light of recent hardware develop-
ments, and there is no plan to use it as our main storage
area for lessons--hence the NOW artificial limit of 
8192 has been lifted.

In 1968 it was noted that there was a marked tendency for 
students to type, e.g. CH??4 ?ˆ for CH?4 and the more obvious 
cases of H??2O for H?2< and 10ˆˆ2 for 10ˆ2. After several users
of PLATO III demonstrated that code to take out the extra
characters greatly improved answer judging, the answer 
command was modified on the system level so that 

answer CH?4 

would judge both CH??4 and CH??4 ?ˆas ok. Extensive tests 
with students demonstrated that this change greatly 
increased the chance that what was to the student a correct
response would be judge ok. In 1972 I was advised that
at that time there were no plans to transfer this feature

Would it be possible to add some "read-only" state to the
-reserve- command? It is generally undesirable to have 
someone reading common while it is in the midst of being
changed (for example, several notes lessons in the past
have had the problem of a note being deleted during the
autobreak/pause/whatever before a -datain- to read that
note), and it seems wasteful to lock everyone out while
someone is only reading the common: if a lesson has high
usage, this results in mysterious long pauses. Naturally,
one can try to simulate such a thing using regular TUTOR
commands, as I have done in the past, but the results
never quite work, since someone always gets out without
doing the finish unit and common is then frozen until
the lesson author can edit common.

I think fritz means a reserve/release dataset oriented

in relation to the datset in question.....

  One of the more common "hard to detect" errors in
TUTOR is an index to an array being out of bounds.

  I don't know if this would be feasable, but I would
like to see something like this added in the near future:

With one-liner functions and array declarations you could
specify a "bounds check" something like
       array(x)=nc(2x-1)¬0bounds,x>0$and$x<100¬1
or any other boolean expression.

  If the boolean expression fails, an execution error
results giving the name of the array and the value of 
the argument of the function or index to the array.

  Because of the fact that systems people seem to be
very involved with debugging aids at the time, wouldn't
this be about the right time to do it?

   The -array- defines will indeed have just such a

an out-of-bounds message, but it might be possible in
the future to give the actual array index. Problem here
is that for multiple-dimensional arrays, it would be hard
to recover the actual indices from the calculated value.

For someone's list:

        Few features any editors on plato use the features
of PLATO that make it what it is... Perhaps a graphical
display of the structure of the define sets as they inter-

The last suggestion, a graphic display of the overlap
and specific locations of defined quantities, is super.
TUTOR may look as bad as assembly languages, and be stuck
with fixed fields and no sophistication in storage
defining, but it has great graphics. So why not let the
one make up for the other. (Not to knock defines too much-
I realize they have great power and flexibility, but they
are hardly pretty).
Hand calculating locations of variables and the attendant
risk of unplanned or misplanned overlap could be much
improved by a graphic display of defined locations.

      I must take issue with Bruce's explanation: the
construction of TUTOR is in error at this point.
        If  y = f(x)
    
        and  z = g(y) = y?y?y,
  
        then z = g(y) = g(f(x)) = f(x)?f(x)?f(x)
as Brand expected,
and not z = f(x)?f(f(x))?f(f(f(x)))
as Bruce explains.

     The algebra of operators for non-linear transforms
created with the -define- command is presently dependent
on which notational convention one uses. Since the
exponential notation has been around some three centuries,
a computer language build without deference to the
convention must be adjudged as in error.

---------- response 3
  06/18     01.12     bowery       rhrc

  The problem is one of terminology.
The -define- command does not exactly set up functions, it
sets up a table of text substitutions which expand like
macros into compilable code.
  I think that AIDS attempts to clarify this unfortunate
but many times useful terminology.
  For example: sin(x?x+1) would work with the system
series but if you defined your own series it would bomb
because at each level the x would increase by 1.
  In other words: the system defined functions behave
as true functions and user defined functions do not
necessarily behave as defined functions.

---------- response 4
  06/18     08.55     b sherwood       s

I don't fully understand Dan's point. I guess Bowery's
way of saying it is as clear as any: the TUTOR -define-
machinery simply substitutes your text wherever you want
it.

define f(x)=3x+5x^2-2sin(x)

means that "f(2+4y)" is interpreted as

3(2+4y)+5(2+4y)^2-2sin((2+4y)).

It is not clear to me whether this is consistent or
inconsistent with mathematics notation. It is true that
its effect is different from evaluating the argument and
substituting that value everywhere, but there is a
practical difference ONLY in the case of assignment, and 
the ? operator is not a standard math operator. So I
think appeal to math here will not select the "right"
interpretation.

Assume, as is reasonable, that you are writing some -use-d

     When in step mode, it would be nice if you could use
a variable's defined name or number, not just the number.
For example, if you have the following code:

define a=n1,b=n2
unit   1
step   on
calc   a?1
       b?2
...
more garbage

     Then when you run the lesson, instead of asking to 
look at n1,n2,etc. be able to call the 'a','b',etc. I
realize that this is probably impossible, but I was
interested in how other authors feel about this. And if
by some chance it is possible, that it may become
implemented.

I agree. That would be a nice feature to add. However,
I dont think that systems people should spend too much
time on something like that when the authors can easily
copy down the variables that they want to use. While this
may take some time, in some cases, I think that systems
have more important things to do.

When you have a "define student" in your lesson,
that section of the symbol table MUST be brought in
whether you have a binary or not. In fact, I should
think that the extra ECS taken up by a "define student"
is exactly this overhead. Correct me if I'm wrong,
sysprogs! (I probably am...)

      I realized that the symbol table was not saved, so
I figured that the option was not possible. However, I
thought I would metion it in case, by some miracle, that
it might be possible. Also, I agree that access to common
variables would be a nice addition. And maybe this feature
will be added in the future (wishful thinking).

   One user is pushing strongly for a revision of the
spacing convention on graph y-lables. Right now the
minimum space between labels depends on the label length
to try to make the labelling look "nice".

   A possible change would be to make the minimum
vertical distance between y-labels be 32 dots (2 lines).
This would permit those who want to, to cram more labels
in per inch.

   I personally feel that crammed labels are "inartistic"
but will make the change if a significant number of users
demand it, and very few are against. Let me know how
you feel IF you have an opinion.

   Some existing labels may become more crammed together
if the change is made. No autoconversion possible.

Some authors who lack teaching experience concentrate

I'm against anything that so radically changes the screen
displays of lessons which the author had thought were
finished. The graphing commands are unique in this respect
in that, being display commands, even minor changes can
alter the displays of prior-existing lessons. Suppose a
lesson exists which has text referring to a particular
label location on a graph -- and the conversion eliminates
or moves this label.

2) Slightly higher probability of adding labels in between

Why not just put the method for using one extra label

label commands did not put labels where I wanted them, I
simply wrote the desired extra labels myself. It would be
a nuisance if one were making a lot of graphs with special
labels, but is really no problem for a few. (Altho, of
course, it only works for specific, fixed, graphs--won't
work if you're specifying a graph whose characteristics
will be determined during execution.)

would eliminate having to search through each game in
order to find someone to challenge. Finally the index
should contain all of the 150 or s0 games that have been

     People, it has been done again, and again, and
again, ad nauseum. The biggest stumbling block is that
by rights, the author of the game should have to give
permission for his/her game to be listed. Not all game
authors want this, and many don't like the idea of their
lesson being restricted "arbitrarily". Possibly even
worse, is that the dividing line between what is a game
and what is an ducational lesson has never been able to
be defined. My feeling is that there is no such division
possible; many games, " spasim" for example, are just
as educational as they are recreational. Who is to decide?
     There are many game indexes already available, but
a universal "system-wide" index is probably impossible.

The reason such a group may not seem "representative of
authors on the system" is that these people are very
busy working on curriculum and spend little time writing
here in notes. We have for some time been somewhat
unhappy with the fact that "notes" is not representative of
the active authors on the system, and that discussions in
"notes" often give a distorted picture of user needs.

The way to make NOTES representative of "active authors"
is to have a category of NOTES to which only active authors
(ie, senior paid professionals and those they invite)
may contribute (others may read, but not write, in the
category; everyone may read and write in other categories).
It is certainly the case the some of the most productive
authors on the system do NOT use NOTES. This is partly
because they just do not want to spend time on something
as "peripheral" as NOTES. But it is also partly because
they regard so much of what is in NOTES as plain garbage,
and because they become impatient with torrents of
know-nothing responses to their contributions. A separate
category with relatively little in it each day, and that
of generally responsible quality, would help the system
get the more representative kind of user input that it
wants and needs.

Author use of the physics site is restricted to those
working on physics curriculum development. We instituted
this restriction on the theory that anyone issuing author
records should be willing to support those records on
terminals under his control. Due to the way such records
have been distributed in the past (that is, pretty freely),
open access by authors has tended to be disruptive of others
trying to use the site. There were also problems of
building security and room maintenance. This restriction
has been in effect since the beginning of April and is
more or less permanent.

unsupervised authors frequently use the system to

* harrass other authors

* occupy space better used by students

* play games, often without regard to shortage of cpu and
  or terminals

* ask frequent and bizarre questions in note files

* generally exhibit some of the worst characteristics
  of mankind

someday there will be, hopefully, selfsupporting plato
systems which will be able to support unrestricted access
FOR A FEE and with a appropriate supervision... this doesn't
seem to be the case for this system though anyone with a
serious purpose can be accomodated.

Re Mr. Kane's response: Are you stating that any
course without a site and/or terminals to support the 
authors issued records by that course are thereby only a
disruptive influence on the system? that no course not
having terminals of its own has no worthwhile purpose
on the system? This is clearly NOT the case. There are
some courses (granted) which do have a lot of game players
and on the whole I would render a guess that they are
mostly located on the Urbana campus. But these surely must
be a minority when all the courses are viewed together. Are
you also stating that the site monitor is incompetent in
handling matters of keeping the room orderly? Then I would
suggest you fire the present monitor and hire one of greater
dependability.

Re Dr. Hody's response: Why do you always raise the "game"

kick off an author (game-playing or not) to get space for
a student if not enough is available in the terminal aspect
of this.

equally drastic, would end this source of argument, for
there are conservative viewpoints wherever one goes. But

Physics does have an excellent room monitor (Denny Kane)
who for humane reasons cannot be there at all hours. Even
when he is there, it has in the past been extremely
difficult to cope with the problems raised by random
authors. The basic problem is that it has been possible
for people with a PLATO course file to create author
records at essentially no cost to them of any kind -- being
responsible for the behavior of these authors, providing
them with access to terminals, etc. CERL has wrestled with
the problem of how to decide which privileged few shall get
sign-ons, and has done poorly, because of being too far away
from the usage points and not being willing to "censure"
what is acceptable or unacceptable use. But a department
doesn't agonize: after trying to run an open shop, physics
simply said "We've had it" and reserved the site for uses
Physics accepts.

  Plato is computer based. Anyone with a basic knowlege
of the idea of compters knows that they are meant ot be
general purpose machines. This does not imply that computers
should not be specialized, only that they could be used for
many purposes. The fact that PLATO can encompass medical
information processing, teaching, and pinball machine char-
acteristics is evidence of the competence of the system
staff.
  If one fails to recognize the capabilities of PLATO
one has a lack of generalized knowlege and divergent
creativity; qualities which most of the originators of PLATO
have clearly posessed.

  Back on the subject: Since PLATO is becoming more
economicly and less research oriented, the restriction of
the physics site seems reasonable and the marketing of
PLATO "pinball" games profitable.

As I understand the current priority in the condense queue,
students have first priority (even after their first 2
"freebies") and then specially allocated terminals come
next. After that I believe system lessons and personnel
get priority and then finally the lowly author gets his
chance. And also, as I understand it there is no "aging"
in the condense queue (ie. if you've been sitting in the
condense queue for a half hour, then you should get some
higher priority assigned to you...), so if you have been
doing a lot of condensing the system "punishes" you by
making you sit in the condense queue a little longer.

        I do agree with parts of the way the condense
priority is assigned (ie. with respect to students: they
should get first priority) but there are also sections
which could be improved.

I don't see what purpose granting increased priority to

new system comes up. From what I have seen, the larger

days anyway, so what difference would that make? And
I hope you are not suggesting something to the effect that
whenever someone writes a game, he have it registered (like
 a gun or something...) with the systems people and have it
put on a list of "games" which would get a lower condense
priority. Condense time is getting a little slower as it

As I have pointed out, Hody, you cannot always tell how a

which is used by several English classes as a part of class
time. It is also used by non-students recreationally. How
would you classify it? Have a systems variable that senses
whether the user is registered in a credit course and is
using the lesson against his will in order to satisfy a
course requirement, or is a useless gamester doing it for
abusive purposes, like enjoying himself? Any argument
which concludes that a lesson should be put on some sort of
low priority list must demonstrate that the CONTENT of the
lesson is of low value rather than that the PURPOSES OF ITS
USERS are worthless.

I STRONGLY DISAGREE. Since pause keys=all has special
features, it should not be the default case as the
pause (blank) implies. In addition, pause keys=all can
cause a few more headaches for authors. Consider the
following:

unit   a
back   b
.
.
goto   c
unit   c
pause  keys=all
goto   (key=back),d,x

When BACK is pressed, the user will go to unit b even though
the author intended him to go to unit d.
I can give other reasons too, but I think those cited above
illustrate my point well enough.

no reason why the system couldn't go through and switch
all pause keys=all 's to pause's, and vice versa, as has
been done in the past. This way, both forms would still
be usable and the most-used case would be default. Makes

  Of course consider the case where an author has 2 words
left in a block and 10: pause <blank tag>s
When you change all those to: pause nobranch
or what ever we might end up with 330 word blocks which
isnt too good on the disk drives.
  Not that this problem could't be overcome but let us
appreciate the trouble the systems staff will have to
go to in implimenting this suggestion.
   Also consider that simply because you are biased toward
one type of pause does not mean that the system as a whole
is the same way. Statistics will have to be taken and

I don't like the suggestion.
As just said, pause keys=all sure does make debugging
a lot easier when you press a strange key and find yourself
some place unheard of. Also, I do tend to use pause -blank-
a whole lot, and I do not mean pause keys=all.

The suggestion of using an entirely different command 
name for a blank.tag pause is an excellent one.

When I use a pause with a blank tag, I generally
use it to catch a key that I want to find the value of.

Therefore, for my purposes, it would be better to
have a "keyin" command than a pause command.

A possible change could involve changing a blank pause
to "wait" and then changing pause keys=all
to a pause (blank), This may even save some program
space...although the system would get more complicated.

     I am completely for Judy's suggestion. Many times


I have been in lessons, and wanted to use a term that
was available in the lesson, only to have to wade through
many pages of text wating for a convenient arrow.
     I do not use a blank tag pause in any of my several
lessons, feeling that the user of the lesson should have
control of the lesson flow at all times. Of course there
are times you don't want this, but I would think that an
overwhelming majority of -pause-s now in use should at
least be "keys=all".

I vote "no"...I would prefer to have a new command replace
the -pause keys=all- case since that is the case that
has the mysterious assumptions (such as processing the
previous function key commands like -back- -lab- etc
I also think that there are more -pause blanks- than
-pause keys=all-...while a search could be done to verify
this...it wouldn't prove anything since...4000 lessons
were written before -pause keys=all- existed! But I would
guess the simple -pause- is still being written more
frequently.

Another point...-pause- has also historically been used for
timing.
So...I like a new command...-wait- = -pause keys=all-
Also "wait" is more human than the computer "pause" and
probably implies all the hidden assumptions better.

Are you saying that -wait <no tag>- would have the same
effect as -pause keys=all-, but that the latter would
remain a valid command with meaning unchanged? If so, fine.
But if you're saying that -pause keys=all- would go away,
I urge further consideration. The only two reasons that
have been offered for any change are: 1) typing the
"keys=all, tag over and over is annoying; 2) it is easy for
authors to write -pause <no tag>- when they mean
-pause keys=all-. As I see it, ¬$2 is the weightier, but
the present set of tags for -pause- is CLEARER than any of
the suggestions for a different set, in that the parallelism
with things like -pause keys=funct- is preserved. That is,
adding -wait- for the sake of ¬$1 seems like an unobjection-
able idea; but removing -pause keys=all- seems likely to
make confusion among the pause-type commands (much?)worse.

I don't think that one would want this to be a check

one might put special "words" in as delimiters for
some routers, or add lesson names to complete a leslist
even though the lessons don't exist at the time.

guarantee that your leslist would always contain

  I don't think it would make much difference, at least

lessons on the author mode page as anywhere else. On
this I speak from experience, as can many, many others.
The only other problem is if students have a leslist

That's what I meant - an iterating program...but perhaps 
the addl command could be restricted similarly to 
the pause command, and space executions
 at least 1 second apart. This 
would slow down a lesson hunting program enough
to make it worthless.

The original request was for the check to be added to the 
SYSTEM leslist editor, not to the -addl- command, something
that would certainly not allow hunting for lesson names.
Something like X-search, where the arrow checks for lesson
existence before adding it to the list to be searched.

I do NOT like the latest unannounced new system feature.,

A student enters a lesson from the system router, before 
completing the lesson he wishes to leave (a jumpout return
is supplied, NOT a jumpout q). The student is marked up 
as having completed this lesson. This can be extremely 
confusing to the student. 

As near as I can pinpoint it this first occured on 6-17-75.
At that time it marked up the index page but not the course

Between 5/8/75 and 6/19/75, 1250 general notes and/or
responses have been written. In a sample of approximately 
10: of these notes and responses (N=97), the following
was observed:

68 different people from 42 different courses wrote the
notes (courses s,p,o,m,and pso were not included in the 
sampleing procedure).

Authors of the notes in the sample were from courses
including: computer science, medicine, chemistry, foreign
language, pharmacy, physics, military training, and 
off-campus users. Many other areas were represented.

The author of a note had been on the system an average of 
223 days with 712 hours average total time on the system. 
(s.d. for days on, 185.7, for hrs on, 803.0)

For authors in courses specifically listed as members of the
plato users advisory committee, the average number of days 
on is 112 and the average total number of hours is 214.
( N=321, no s.d.'s available)

The argument being pressed here is not that the authors 
of general notes are more representative of PLATO than
authors represented by the advisory committee, but that 
the authors of general notes are in fact quite 
representative of PLATO users if we assume that those who
use PLATO the most are most representative of PLATO.

assuming your note is a follow up to

and author use of notes that jim bowery suggested
there would be more to the point. as has often been ob-

correlation this way: look in tebby's book "plato iv

authors, then look at notes for the period cited to see
how many lines of notes those authors wrote in that period;
then also look to see which 10 authors wrote the most lines 
of notes during that period, and look in tebby's book to see
how many hours of lessons they have authored. // unfortun-

The key words here are "RUNNING CLASSES". Those users
who have actually tried running classes will understand
that an instructor running classes on PLATO is lucky if
he is able to sign on for longer than the 5 minutes
needed to change his router index, or whatever. Most of
the people on the PLATO Users' Committee do indeed spend
considerable time on the system, and the time they do spend
is devoted to curriculum development and course management.
"Statistics" such as those you quote can be very misleading;
from your note it is not clear to me exactly what you think
you have measured -- signon time for a particular author
record, without information from the individual on how he
works, is not meaningful. In any case, the time a user
spends on the system is clearly not necessarily
proportional to his contribution to PLATO educational
endeavors.

1. People that run classes/collect statistics don't
necessarily know ANYTHING at all about plato.

2. While playing moonwar all day may increase time spent
on the system, many courses (such as med, mfl) are spe-
cifically for work only, and therefore times on the system
do reflect work done.

3. The most prolific authors are not necessarily those
with their names on the most datapages, as john gilpin
suggests. I have written many lessons, but the name on
the datapage reflects the group that owns the lesson.

Many thanks to Jim Kraatz for the effort he put forth.
The statistics that he collected, allowing for things
such as people getting a new signon and losing old

I appreciate the comments so far, but the topic of
discussion is clearly a matter of prejudice.

We must talk of individuals instead. Here we have some
of the most productive people on the system saying that
general notes is not used in proportion to the productivity
of the individual. This is true. But you see this is as
it should be. Free speech as never been known for its
lack of vocal cords, but to choose any other path is a
mistake. I'm sure that in this light that we are all in
agreement. The benefit of freedom is that Plato serves
the many users extremely well instead of the few extremely
well. It may be true that notes would be more useful to
the plato committee people if there were fewer comments
from the less experience/productive,
but to maximize the flow from non-productive to productive
and thereby maximize the healthy growth of the system
freedom is necessary.

Many of the Foreign Language courses which have PLATO

Hence they never write notes in NOTES.
(Our Hebrew TA's almost never do, yet their 80 students
were running fine all last semester.)

As to lesson development: I will admit (freely) that the
Hebrew materials may not be as good, instructionally, as
the chemistry lessons, but our lesson developers have
plenty of time to get the material written AND write
notes. (and even play games in their spare time!) This
even applies to one programmer who had to learn the

on cai systems which, unlike plato, charge by the hour
(as high as $10/hr commonly), "use rate" expressed in
terminal hours is held up for inspection as an important
parameter for judging the level of acceptance of the
cai materials by their intended audience. by attempting
to segregate as much as possible the recreational from the
educational programs so that the two types of "lessons"
are accessed form different records and recorded separately,
the medical author group has tried to restore the usefulness
of the "user-hour" measurement.

i might add that this attempt at separate records for
recreation has been met with a great deal of resistance,

Incredible.

Plato users who are off-system when they "use" PLATO tend 
to communicate via NOTES less than plato users who are 
on-system most of the time. Surprise. 

PLATO users who are writing programs (as opposed to lessons)
have more to write notes about. This could be do to the
fact that "programming" type commands are probably the 
least developed area of the system at this point.

All this profundity because the Plato Users Committee had 
set down guidelines for issuing author records which 
anyone with access to a course can ignore if he so chooses.

To the denizens of "new feature land": how about a new
feature as follows...
        A "term-bin" or "term-seg", analogous to "term-calc"
which would:

a) require one to either enter the octal or integer 
   value of a variable, or even just the variable number
   (when in the common, course, or dataset editors);
b) would ask for a byte size (default=60);
c) would show the binary value of each byte;
d) would show the octal and integer values of each byte. 

This would be _GREAT_ for looking at segmented variables!!
(and for debugging routines which use segments, etc)

(showing the binary value is not really even necessary 
from my viewpoint, but as long as you're designing a
generally applicable feature it might be good to include.)

BUT wouldn't it be nice to be able to do it in the

The binary value of each bit can be easily determined 
from the octal. for instance: 0267=b010110111
so you can figure out the binary of n6 (for example)
by entering "n6" in step mode. It will show the
octal, from which you can determine the binary.

In light of the recent discussion in "notes" about the 
problems of recording lesson completion, we will soon
change the system router so -end lesson- and
-lesson completed- are the only means for declaring that 
a lesson has been completed. If a student leaves a lesson
without encountering either of these, the lesson will 
NOT be flagged as completed.

For utility programs and other lessons having no logical 
"completion" point, we feel that the most appropriate
solution is to put a -lesson completed- in the i.e.u..

Note that -jumpout q- (and -jumpout- (blank), etc.) will 
still take a student to the "end lesson" unit of his 
router. The router can of course do whatever is 
appropriate. The system router will treat these exits 
similarly to a SHIFT-STOP exit from the lesson.

There are at least four directly -use-able notefile systems

them have options which can be tailored to specific course
needs in varying degrees. All of them can be implemented

notesfiles referenced in the previous response while they 
are extremely useful do not answer the need for the
function of entering comments directly from a display
within a lesson, without damaging more than the bottom
three lines of the display.

pending such a new feature, a "comment mode" has been
implemented by members of the medical author group.
it does not work in all lessons and uses considerable
resources but should be helpful until the system provides
this feature in an integral manner.

some versions of systems which run on coursewriter and

WATFIV is a compiler which is run on a IBM S/360 and you

If the original game has a copyright listed on it (just

be a violation of the copyright laws as they now stand. 

Why copy a game anyway? We have enough war games on the

Since it appears that -endings- is going to be of very 
great value in extending the uses of -vocab-/-vocabs-, could 
we have a -prefix- command to do the same good work on the 
other end of words ? Some nouns and verbs are capable of 
taking as many as 8 to 10 different prefixes, which extend 
their meanings tremendously. It would be even nicer if the 
-prefix- could be used several times on the same word, since 
English will accept multiple prefixes more readily than it
will accept multiple suffixes: e.g "re-de-inter-mixture"(the
FCC regulations about owning more than one mass medium in 
the same market): 3 prefixes, 1 suffix....
ndh

---------- response 1
  06/23     10.11     tenczar       s

The -endings- command is useful in -vocabs- because
frequently "those" words are to be thought of as synonyms 
for the "base" word: i.e., dish/es/ware.
Because of the limited nature of TUTOR's -vocabs/concept-
feature and the fact that a changed prefix usually means 
a different word...I don't see the applicability of making 
a -prefix- command that "makes" synonyms, Now at some 
super Artificial Intelligence systems, they would surely 
want to make a lot out of prefixes....

---------- response 2
  06/23     12.56     david       hebrew 

Agreed that, at present, prefixes have little applicability 
to answer judging. 

However, lack of prefixes would tend to inhibit future use 
of PLATO in large countries like Tanzania, whose major 
language (Swahili) uses prefixes in the same way that
English uses endings.

Well, you don't need to go that far afield: Turkish could

"work/ed" is useful....

of -common- in AIDS before really fooling around with it. 
I think you'll find that they mention that if you have a

loaded and you must do that yourself with the -comload-

Layman's question is not "Why did this happen?" but rather

He knows that commons > 1500 are not automatically loaded,

Assuming by condense error, you mean a warning telling

was found, i still cannot see why this should produce

Besides the military and manufacturer, you might try 
looking for an old Motors Manual (tries to give the most
important info on the most common vehicles) in a library.
On the other hand. a general description of automotive
wiring may help, unless your jeep is equipped with some
specialized military gear(waterproofing,24volts). For a
large sample of the automotive lessons developed at Chanute
AFB try signing on under "mechanic" of "af1". Warner was
thinking of Aberdeen's lesson on trouble-shooting the

  Is there any particular reason why a dataset must be 
attached to reserve/release dataset? I realize it makes 
sense since a wonderful application for reserve dataset
is to reserve a dataset, but..... it would also be 
very handy to set up flags for many purposes! Ie, if 
you had several areas of common you wished reserved
separately, the reserve common is not enough. However, 
were it not prerequisite that a dataset be attached, 
you could use

define area1=1,area2=2,area3=3,etc.
reserve dataset,area3,1

and everybody would be happy. Pretty please?

No. There are lots of ways of handling this problem 
yourself, though, by setting up your own simple
interlocks. For example, one way to do it is to have a 
"reserved" flag for each area of your common, and just 
reserve the common each time you set (or test) each flag.

---------- response 4
  06/23     17.59     fritz       ames

  Yes, but much experience has shown that author-provided 
flags are far from foolproof (which is why the reserve
common and datset features are so heartily welcomed!).
Excecution errors, system crashes, etc, all can cause
the flag to never be cleared, resulting in a frozen 
common. We need systems-set flags which are not affected 
by these problems! (I realize I can do it myself, but...)
---------- response 5

I spent some time designing my own common "reserved"

any trouble with it. If you are interested in the 
algorithm, it is very simple, and I can give it to you

the names in the preceding list and previous response
reflect the most serious investigators in this general 
area-- unfortunately the question of the effectiveness 
of the simulations (particularly with respect to their 
stated objectives) is very hard to answer experimentally.
*
most physicians enjoy the simulations as a "game" but 
many have trouble with the man-machine interface, partic.
on other systems, and also find the depth of the simulations
to be rather shallow. subjectively, it seems the most
successful deal with narrow subjects such as the management
of a single specific problem (ie. diabetic coma, etc)
*
by the way, this is probably of less than general interest-
did you consider healthnotes as a vehicle?

You can get the effect anyold time you like if you create a 
unit that's too long, perhaps with a bunch of calcs or 
writec's, and putting in an entry point somewhere, so that
the unit named by the "entry" is what's too long. You can
change the name the condensor error stuff gives the "too
long" unit by fiddling with the length of the unit.

  Back to the -do- issue, you should be warned that a 
-do- takes MUCH more time than an equivilant -doto- or 
text insertion. This is because of the time the processor 
must spend to bring the -do-ne unit into CM (since it only
works on one unit at a time), and as long as I have to wait 
for this new unit, why not serve this other guy waiting 
in line? Meanwhile, you are put back out on the queue. 
A quick test shows that replacing a -do- with a text
insertion speeds your code up by a factor of roughly 
5 or 6 realtime - not entirely dependable due to 
autobreak - and 2 processing time. Isn't it worth the 
extra line or two to gain that speed and CPU saving?

The code:

at    n1
erase n2,n3

  takes approximately .0003 sec to execute.

do    erase (n1,n2,n3)
unit  erase
at    n1
erase n2,n3

executes in approximately .0006 sec.
(In both cases, n1=1001, n2=2, n3=2.)
Real time to execute 100 repetitions of the code varied
between 9.5 and 12.5 sec for both methods.
(times not exclusive of overhead)

---------- response 6

the use of "do" in this case seems to me to be more

use of do also promotes "thinking modular" in the

 Agreed, with a unit which is done once and then the 
lesson waits for a response or some such situation, the 
-do- improves readiability. What I implore is this 
type of code:

codecodecode
do      write
morecodemorecode
unit    write 
write   Hi there!
or 

do       a,count?1,100

unit     a
code 
do       b,counter?1,50

etc,etc, ad nausem... in such a case -doto- is MUCH better.

     I agree with Mr. Hody. At times of heavy cpu 
usage I am sure that optimization of code can be a
great help. However, one must balance the importance
of execution efficiency versus the clarity of the 
code. IN MY OPINION, the structuring of the program 
text is as important as the program execution itself.
In these days of pressures to keep lesson size down, 
it is hard to find any but experienced authors using 
extensive define sets, comments, and structured sub-
routines, and I believe that these should be stressed 
MUCH more to all authors. 
      I agree that possibly the original example of 
a subroutine to erase is somewhat unnecessary, but 
if it lends greatly to the structuring of the code, 
then I am all for it!

---------- response 9

        "structure" has been bandied about so much by 
supposedly knowledgeble people that, as fas as I am
concerned, it is hardly applicable to anything anymore.
        A guy comes up and says "I like 'structured
programming'", then another says " this is a nice program 
structure", or, "this structure eats CPU, but it's
structured programming", or, "this structured program is
 optimal" (I defy him to answer "optimal in what respect ?",
because he'll say "structure"... argh)

an art, so, to all, Code On!

Response 4 seems a little confused...PLATO can't go away
and process another user while it is waiting for a unit
to be read from ECS -- reading ECS ties up the CPU. And 
while PLATO can only "work on" one unit at a time, many
units can be in CM at once. Note that a 
do unit,index?1,1000
does not require that the -do-ne unit be read from ECS
1000 times, since after it is initially read in it will 
stick around for a while.
---------- response 11
  06/24     17.03     iezek       ames 

It seems that everyone has their own trade-offs as far 
as readability, nice structure, fast execution, lesson
space, etc. are concerned. This is not to say that
some cases do not go overboard (such as inserting an extra
do when the commands themselves will be sufficient) but 
often times decisions depend on what the individual
programmer wants to maximize or minimize in his style of 
programming and at that particular point in the lesson.

   The answer "as soon as possible" is the most honest 
anwer we can give you, since completion of work depends 
on many interlocking tasks from many different people.
The room is big enough to hold 20 drives, but there is 
no particular reason to assume that we will ever need
or acquire that many. To assuage your curiosity, we 
would probably keep even with requests for lesson space 
if we ordered one disk every three months, which we will 
try to do. Now if you, personally, can guarantee that 
funding will also keep even...!!

---------- response 10

To add a few more scraps of information:

1)  The disk extender we have now on site will permit us to 
extend to 22 drives; our single disk controller can be 
extended to a limit of 64 drives.

2)  Long before we reach the above limits we hope that CDC
will be marketing double density drives.

3)  The "asap" situation is three more drives. 

4)  "asap" has been receding at a rate of slightly less
than a month/month since we first started pushing for more
disk space last October. It is hard for me to believe
that we won't have more disk space by mid-July. But I 
have been surprised many times since October.

is more complex. as long as tutor stays the way it
is currently structured (an observation-- not a
criticism¬D), then simply renaming -judge- will be more
confusing than clarifying. the trouble is that the
intuitive name "judging" for the tutor state of that
name is misleading-- because of the 'ing ending one
assumes that judging commands in effect judge student
answers and some, of course do.... but the judging state
is more explicitly a state in which judging commands are
executed! "judging" of answers with its implication of
"ok" or "no" often doesn't occur in the course of execution
of "judging" commands.
*
for example:
judging commands frequently do not "judge" anything
but instead accept (-store-) or modify (-put-)
an answer.(cont)

---------- response 3

the situation is made worse for the naive programmer
Because some "judging" commands switch off the judging
state under some conditions, and not under others while
other "judging" commands always do and yet others never
do! and then along comes "judge" which is executed in
"regular" state and yet affects the "judge_ment_" which
the system makes of the answer!
*
now even if you are a hard core tutor expert, you can't
possibly be immune to that degree of confusion.
*
of course everything hangs together very well, the system
permits practically anything anyone would want to do, and
the sherwood manual and aids explains the whole mess so
a 12 year old could understand it (if his initials are df
and i don't mean dave fuller!)
*
but it is too much to think changing -judge- to -assess-
will do anything but further obscure.

Aha! Dr. Hody is correct, so far as I know, about -judge-
switching into a "judging state" (in accord with my sugges-
tion, of course, it would be an "assessing state"),but I
cannot refrain from noting that the other considerations he
mentions fit admirably with the meanings of"assess" in
Webster's International (Webster II, again: my Webster III
is at home): to store is what the taxman does with the
assessment on one's homeFor instance, and other meanings
of assess include apportionment, determination, evaluation,
and fixation. Right on -assess- !

i hope someone keeps this on a list; i'm sure we'll spend
several days again converting to a -writer- structure
once its done; our ways of programming around it are costly
in terms of jumpouts and ecs; and they're fraught with
the danger of losing critical information in the event of
an error; and they're complicated enough to raise the
probabilites of just such an error occuring.

      For clarification (I hope!) of terms causing problems
here:
(1) student BANK in system lingo is used to describe the
  total user status of about 400 words. This area
  contains many system pointers and could not possibly
  be made available to users to change in general because
  of the danger of fouling up the user and possibly even
  crashing the whole system.
(2) student VARIABLES...these of course are under the
  control of the user and are a part of the student bank
(3) student RECORD...this holds the student variables and
  router variables and a few other words from the student
  bank (lesson, unit for restart, last time on system, etc.)
  and is stored on the disk when the user signs off (the
  student bank is the area reserved when the user is ON
  the system).

writing directly onto his record on the disk. My personal

the possible misuses and dangers of such a feature outweigh
its virtues; however, this opinion does not reflect the

A thought for "some day". It has been proposed that
the copy key be made operative on the author mode page
upon backing out of the editor. Should this change be made
it would be all the nicer if after backing out of the editor
a number typed at the arrow would be concatenated (sp?) to
the alpha part already saved.

The idea is to be able to exit lessonx and move to lessony
by just entering y at the arrow. And you systems folk
would either have to give up one luxury or never taste the

The copy key was active a while back but was taken off
because it caused too many problems with keeping lesson
names from freely floating around the system for ANYOne to
look at. But you have hit upon a insane idea. Why not
edit the copy buffer to bump the ending number and put
the name in mode erase. Then one just hits -copy-, types in
the new number, hits next, the mode erase is bumped out of
the judgeing copy and you find your self in the new lesson
you wanted and no one is the wiser as far as confidential
lesson names is concerned. Of course the edit key would
have to be disabled when the mode erase name is printed.

Has any further thought been given to the idea
of having a SYSTEM-supplied page to which a routed
student is taken upon STOP1, as in the system router?

It doesn't even have to have a new command; it can
be implemented as:
*
route stop1,stopunit
*
working as follows: When a student presses STOP1, he
is taken to a system page saying he can STOP1 again
to leave, DATA  to resume lesson he was in, or NEXT for
the main index. If he presses NEXT, it takes him to
unit "stopunit" in the router. (DATA does a jumpout
resume, and STOP1 gives a Press-NEXT-to-begin.)

A STOP1 from the router would of course kick you off.
I can't see any security holes in this. Further, I can't
see why it is impossible to implement. So why not?

       One question:

       Would the router's finish unit be done directly
after the student pressing STOP1(the first time) to leave
the lesson, or would it be done after the final STOP1 which
takes the student off the system?? This would definitely
make a difference, as not many people want duplicate data
in the same place.
  
        I think that this would be a worthwhile feature
for those people who don't use the system router(notice I
didn't say that I vote for it!) because of the problems
of explaining to a student that he has to sign-in again if
he leaves the lesson, accidently or purposely. In demos
given using our router (see -danwork-), it is hard to give
a person an overall view when s/he must constantly sign-in
over and over.

may be implemented also. Unless people who are working

backwards search initiators than c-shiftnext, etc. Will
bring this to the attention of the proper persons. Thanks.

One problem is that terminals located in class rooms
can go for several hours without the problem being brought
to the attention of some one who knows how to turn off the
lamp. The bulb can come on and the shutter stay closed

doesn't turn off the light!! it only closes the shutter
and brings the slide tray to the "home" position. Bulbs
at inactive terminals are burning out right and left... and
be done along the lines of what dick suggested. Lets face
it, inactive terminals are costing more to run than when
the terminals are being used. So, I hope to see something

no commands _must_ be before the first unit command. thus
a lesson does _not_ necessarily have an "initial entry unit".

after consulting with several thousand people, it doesn't
take long to figure out that many people forget what
lesson they are -use-ing, the -charset- command no longer
words properly (no -charset- was executed), etc....

this list could go on ¬+ on. the commands suggested in 
AIDS for the i.e.u. are there to make it easier on you
to find errors.

    While using -writec-, I discovered (not too quickly)
that it did not work as I thought it should in the follow-
ing case:
    writec var,,,"phrase1","phrase2",

    The problem, I assume, is that the quotes (") are rep-
resented as the characters SHIFT comma, so to TUTOR my
phrase looked like:
    var,,,SHIFT,phrase1SHIFT,,SHIFT,phrase2SHIFT,,

    Thus, when var=1 or 2, I was writing either SHIFT or
phrase1SHIFT. The answer, if you wish to embed quotes (or
commas), is to use another delimeter, namely, ¬, (SHIFT 
access comma). Sherwood (VI-6) illustrates the use of
embedded commas, but not quotes, using the ¬, delimiter.
    Some of you may have discovered this anomaly and its
cure already, but for those you who have not, I thought I
would pass it along. Bob Moore.

Just a note that you can get the ¬, by either

Either way is just as good, but micro comma is a bit
easier to decipher on a printout.

Shift-square-comma and micro-comma are identical on

shift-square (access) "character".?

NOTE: all these comments refer to the separator for the
-writec- _only_. many people try to use the ¬, for other
commands. it only works for -writec-. the semicolon
is used in some commands, but not all. in AIDS, the
separator(s) for that command are always listed.

watch out for colons (:) when using a semicolon as the
separator in -writec-....same problem as dave mentioned

Is the following behavior intentional??

In case 1, the word "failed" is erased when next is
pressed after the no judgement. In case 2, the word
"failed" DOES NOT ERASE when next is pressed after the no
judgement. The only difference between the two is the
use of an embedded mode. What's happening ???

---------- response 1
  06/26     11.46     s stone       iu

The command ¬0m,r¬1 is condensed into the famous SHIFT? 4
when encountered by the condensor. Hence the erase of the
last write has the following effect:
mode    erase
at      1010
write   SHIFt?4failed
which rewrites "fialed" again!

---------- response 2
  06/26     12.12     tenczar       s

to explain it in a different way...
the automatic erasure of no-longer-applicable writing
is accomplished by TUTOR's setting the terminal to mode
erase and then re-executing the last write statement
encountered after judging a student's response.
However, if this write statement explicitly takes charge of
the write/erase state of the terminal...then so be it.
You can see this nicely by the following write statement:
        write Hello¬0m,r¬1 Joe
The "Hello" _is_ erased...but not the "Joe."
Another thing to be careful about is showing a variable
whose value changes between the "post-judging" write and
the "clean-up" erase. E.g.,
   write You have answered ¬0s,count¬1 problems.
   calc  count?count+1
In this case, the second execution (in mode erase) of the
write statement will erase "count+1" instead of "count"
from the screen and leave a mess.

   There has been a suggestion that we implement a -gcircle-
command to make the graph drawing commands fully compatable
with the regular drawing commands, but what should it do?
   gcircle R,X,Y
There is no confusion with locating the center. X,Y would
be scaled according to the current scale values (linear,
log, or polar) to locate the center of the circle. But
what happens with the radius? (1) Should it always
represent the radius in dots of a true circle? (2) Should
it represent a scaled radius of a true circle? (3) Should
R be scaled differently along x,y axes if scales are
different so gcircle could produce an ellipse!? (4) In
latter case should we just give up if log or polar scales
are in force?
   Anyone who has need of such a command should send me
his views via pnotes. If I get few answers, I will forget
the whole thing.

cannot be held to be intelligent enough to use such
a power wisely. Either they would lean on it as a crutch
to scatter units randomly throughout a lesson, instead of
being forced to organize them logically, or they would
abuse it heavily. With no prospect of the present loading

to implement any features as marginally beneficial as

to press NEXT1 (or BACK1) or to go out to the directory
and press the letter of the following (or preceeding)
block: 1. If the block has been changed, it must be
written back to disk(one access)
        2. If not, the next (or last) block must be
read in.(one more)

        The only place i could see where this could be a

In AIDS the writeup on HELP states that the base pointer
(baseu) is reset to the unit in which help is requested.
This is not quite correct in that a 'base' command in
the unit preceding the unit from which help was requested
apparently "locks" the help sequence from properly setting
baseu. Thus:

unit   a                              unit  help
next   b                              *

*                                     end
unit   b
help   help
*

pressing BACK in unit help takes me to unit a, NOT to unit
b!!!!! What gives!

Strange but true. When you execute a -base- with a tag,
that puts you in a help sequence. Pressing a help-type
key within a help sequence, (which is what is happening
in your code, since "baseu" is set) doesn't give you a
new "baseu". So when the help sequence is finished, you 
return to unit a. Unit b never becomes the base unit.

Nuts, it's not that hard to fathom!?
If the base unit is non-0, you are in a help sequence.
If the base unit is 0, you are NOT in a help sequence.?
Back/back1 from a help sequence returns to the base unit
and zeros the base unit. Next when waiting at an -end-
does the same thing.?
Pressing a help key sets the base unit, UNLESS it's
already set, in which case the base unit is unchanged.?
Executing a base command sets the base unit if there is
a tag, or zeros it if there is not.

quested!! The writeup is MISLEADING in that it makes
no mention of the effect described in the note. The
fact is that help DOES NOT reset baseu as indicated!

The original note does not say that setting baseu "manually"
does not indicate a help sequence in subsequent main  units
to TUTOR. It says HELP does NOT reset baseu as written up!

you can inspect student vars in a, o, i, or v format.
Unfortunatly, you must use the crude variable number
(ie n1, v78, etc) and you cannot inspect common. Help

Your lesson's common code will still apply in most cases.

In the case of a dataset uitility lesson, such as "datasets",
the system used to check the author's security code. If
it matched, write access was allowed. Now, such a lesson
would require you to type in the common codeword
of the dataset before it can access your dataset.
You now have to trust the author of the lesson you
type your codeword into, and you know when and where
such accessing of your dataset occurs.

Additionally, one lesson will be able to access several
datasets with different codewords if so programmed.

The former means of letting a user (not just a lesson)
access a dataset used the author's codeword, and was done
automatically. Thus a lesson that shouldn't have access to
a dataset could get it if a user of that dataset were to
enter the lesson. That is, access could be "stolen" to
datasets, with no way for the user to know. The explicit
codeword in the third argument is an optional argument;
as previous responses here indicate, it may be an explicit
literal (which can be read by anybody who can read your
lesson), or in a variable, typed in by the user (appropriate
for general-use lessons). It is up to the user to decide
whether he trusts the lesson he is in enough to type in his
codeword!

  06/27     18.49     daleske       ames

The questions in help-notes to the problem of excessive
amounts of source space being wasted due to the present
structure of the segment define (segment and segment, vert-
ical) have been unanswered except to say that there will
be little change for quite sometime.

This problem may be viewed from at least four points:
        1] readability of the code
        2] savings of space
        3] cost of conversion of present condensor
        4] savings or increase in cpu usage due to
           condensor change

Readability is not degraded (I feel) by changing the present
structure of segment,array1=n23,6  (or)
        segment,vertical,array2=n25,1,23
(to)    seg,array1=n23,6; seg, vert,array2=n25,1,23
A test of this structure will show a savings of an average
of 1 to 3 words per array define. (tab, and "ment","ical")
    (cont'd in responses)

---------- response 1
  06/27     18.59     daleske       ames

An additional savings will not be noticed if the define
is changed from "segment" to "s" (instead of "seg") or
"vertical" is changed to "v" (instead of "vert"). The
readability is decreased markedly. Also, a conflict with
the "s" for signed segments is inherent.

I cant really comment on the cost of conversion to the
condensor, though I would assume that it would not be
very expensive.

The savings in cpu use would in the short run be negligible.
The scanner that parses (assuming that scanning IS the meth-
od used for the parse) would have less work in attempting 
to find a match. However, the addition of more kernels into
the parse might increase the scan...

Will the verticals operate within the "array" structure?
(i.e. will we be able to set bounds on verticals if not
able to define the verticals as the arrays or 'horizontal'
segments as discussed in lesson "array"?)

(1) Your comments about more than one segment per line
    have been answered before. Answer is still the same:
   It is possible, but will not be done soon.

(2) Arrays (coming up soon) will NOT include segmented
   arrays in first release, but provision has been made
   for segmented arrays in future (at least 1 yr).
    Current thinking is that segmented arrays will be
    either vertical-type or horizontal-type but not
    both. (Note: This is to satisfy your curiosity

Being that this is after prime time and (as the sign says)

probably for those trying to actually get some work done

pressed on people. But the thing I noticed was that I was

   What is the reason that up arrows (¬W) and down arrows(¬X)
are not listed as such on a printout, even though they do
exist on our printer (as evidenced by carriage returns, and
the up arrows preceeding capital letters).
   
   Up arrows are presently shown as (not ¬W W) and down
arrows are shown as (not ¬X X).

   Like most printers, ours has only 64 symbols available
to signify some 250+ displayable terminal characters, so
no matter which ones were picked to be displayed with one
printing character, many others must be displayed with
two or three.

   To save much effort and confusion it was decided to
make the printer characters and the internal character
codes as alike as possible. The printed ¬W was chosen as
most representative of the shift code. If you will look
at aids, you will see the displayed ¬W is represented by
the internal code 76-70-27 , or access-shift-w, so the
printout of this gives: "ˆ_¬=?'"(access) ¬W (shift) W (w).

---------- response 2
  06/29     05.55     blomme       s

   Also, of course, the coding scheme in general attempts
to make the most frequently used symbols have only a
single character representation. Thus, for example, ¬W
was not considered important enough to be included among
the 1st 64 characters--and hence automatically required
at least two characters to represent it. The code
for "shift" naturally needed to be among those first 64
characters and amongst the "unused" print symbols, "¬W"
seemed the best choice for placement of the shift code.
   And, as Don Shirer has said, since we have no hope
of reproducing the actual appearance of a line with our
regular printer, we have chosen simply to print our
internal code--which incidentally lets you see those
"hidden" characters that never appear on your screen but
can sometimes produce strange effects!

There is in - aids-, under 'print symbols' or 'printout',
a list of some of the symbols and what they correspond to.
What I would find useful is a list of all the symbols which
might appear on the print. It is sufficient to know just
the ones that appear in aids IF you have access to a key-
board to see that a shifted 5 is a :, but it would be easier
to have such a complete list when, for example, a secretary
is re-typing from a print. With a diagram or photo
from one of CERL's publication and the list given in aids
we have had little trouble, but i can see the need for a
complete list.

The problem with replacing all occurences at once is that
you might screw up something important just because it
wasn't in the 30 or so lines displayed...besides, i often
DON'T want all occurences replaced! It just seems safer

and the intention is to leave -pnotes- this way...we
believe the current scheme causes a note-writer to think
before he sends a note...thus eliminating a lot of "junk"
notes...it is similar to the US mail...if you drop it in
the mailbox...you have to make a federal case out of
stopping it from getting to its destination...one can only
imagine how much poison-pen letters are stopped by the
fact that the author can't change his mind once it is
dropped in the mailbox.

(It must be obvious to all computer types that writing
the software to "retrieve" a -pnote- before it is read

Pnotes is very nice just the way it is...but does take some
getting used to. One technique that has its uses is to
write a draft of a note and send it to oneself. One can
revise and re-send as often as necessary and, when time
permits, take a fresh look after waiting a while. This
not only protects somewhat from keyset-in-mouth disease,
but is also some protection against system crashes--which
can be very handy writing notes after 10pm.

I would like to see a flag added to students using the
system router, which would enable these students to (almost)
ignore the router. When a student whose flag is set enters
the system router, he is jumped out to "rstartl,rstartu"
regardless of the action of the router at the moment.
Suuch an "ignored" student would be valuable in many
academic courses where it is desirable to test lessons
using routed students, but not modify the system router
to allow all students into the course.

For many years, there have been two principal suppliers
of high quality cardboard boxes to the student/staff
community in Urbana. I am refering of course to the
Computing Services routing room and local booze
stores. The first of these has recently declined
drastically in quality in that the operators now tear the
tops of the boxes off. When one uses the latter source,
one runs the risk of either being hassled externally or
internally into buying something which usually results
in calling some friends over for a party, to help consume
the brew purchased in order to get the free box. I have
nothing against parties, but perhaps PLATO could improve
the campus box situation. What is done with plato paper
boxes? Could they be placed in an easily accessible
place, maybe the lounge or a lower stairwell for removal
by box users?

words of the common at a time, and may have a remainder of
less than 6.

An input from the external jack at a -pause keys=all-
does not break the pause. A -touch- key does break a pause
of this type. Further a -touch- input does break the
-pause keys=touch- as expected but an -external- key does
not. The explanation in aids states that the touch key
accepts keys > 256 which should include inputs from the
external channel as well. It seems that three repairs are
needed:
      1. Fix keys=all to accept all keys.
      2. Set a keys=ext to allow external input
         specifically.
      3. Correct documentation in aids so at least the
         operation of the system is described until the
         above changes can be made.
Currently only the blank pause will accept an external key.
This puts all function key processing back to the user.

   Well, if "good" = "old" I might understand the
possibility for confusion, since on older versions of
TUTOR the back command was sort of searched for and
executed when the key was pressed (and likewise for
other keys of same ilk)...this mode of operation was
changed long ago now so that those commands are executed
when encountered--which makes a FAR easier and logical
thing to explain.
   It also makes for the following simple rule: if you
want to change the "back" unit because of a specific
answer or completion of some operation or whatever,
THEN (at the time you have made a new choice) execute
a back command.

I assume you mean you want your lesson to be able to

the common on disk, and to have more than one block of
common used by the lesson. If you reread the aids
writeup on common, you will find that the common your

common.

I assume you want to be able to "reserve" or "release"

can reserve or release more than one block of a dataset.
The answer it NO. However, if necessary, we might add
more than one common reserve flag, but it wouldn't be
block by block.

A note of programming practice: Commons are nice clean
features in that they are not dependant on the length
of a tutor block. The lesson specifies how much common
it needs, and Plato gives him that much of the common
from disk. Datasets are not clean, they depend on
the tutor block length, which may change. You would
not want us to add an unclean common block reserve/release
feature to an otherwise clean feature, would you?

no matter how much common you specify it is charged to your
lesson in block units. Many, many times I only need and
ask for 10 or 20 words of common but am always charged with
347 words (or one full block). I can partially condense
the blocks I want to reduce ECS usage, and I can 'stop'
and 'strat' within a block to further reduce ECS charged
against my lesson, so why oh why can't I specifiy 10 words
of common and only be charged for 10! If we get hit with
another ECS crunch like the one that hit us last year, and
get socked with a 1500 word ECS practical prime-time limit,
every word counts. Even now it doesn't seem fair
to be charged for something we don't ask for.

In editcom I put the features most often needed by the
few users who need a common editor. What you suggest
might be added if enough users say they need it. I
wonder what you are working on that would make it
"fairly essential" that this be in editcom, and not
in a utility routine in your own lesson.

It IS in a utility routine in my lesson just as a

Do like i did,and just look around ,every once
in awhile finding a new lesson and putting in
your own list.Ask your friends about their own lessons
and if you look around the place you are at, and find
a new lesson on somebody elses terminal,ask the
person if he would mind telling you what lesson it is.
Its just like coin collecting.

The argument stuff is "interpreted" when it is encountered.
When you jump to gork(3), right then and there PLATO figures
out what the 3 is, and remembers it while it jumps to unit
gork...then it sticks the 3 in the variable specified in
the unit...having it work with the next/back commands would
mean saving the arguments when the next or back or whatever
command is encountered, then, when the key is hit, going
back and figuring out where the arguments were saved, and so
on...messy.

pause  keys=next
jump   unitname( ..parameters... )

The fact that this is equivalent to nextnow in every

problems associated with key arming (next command, etc)
that were previously mentioned.

? Yes , conditional forms for passing arguments are?all right.
  Incidentally, I presume that -nextnow- also sets a
pointer just as -next- does, except it makes NEXT the only
active key, and thus argument passing would run into the?same problem.  Also, I think in jones' example that the
-next (blank)- to disarm the next pointer is a redun-
dant tactic, since -pause keys=next- is only "broken"
by the NEXT key, and -jump-ing then changes the main unit.=============¬??--paul

Dr. Hody: yes you can pass parameters on a conditional do
join jump or goto.

Paul Cohen: if the -next- key behaved like any of the other
function keys, the -next (blank tag)- would be needed to
avoid an automatic jump as soon as the pause is satisfied,
before the explicit jump is encountered. You may be right
that it is not required for the -next- key.

Although messy it would still be nice to have arguments

In particular I have needed something like:

Yes I got around not having the command, but that was a
little messy too.

We do indeed plan to
a) turn off the slide projectors with the initial "press
   next to begin" message,

b) turn off the slide projectors as a terminal is signed in
   or out.

c) attempt to turn off the slide projectors while the
 "plato down" tapes are running.

I would appreciate hearing whether "a" and "b" are expected
to solve most of your problems--and I am concerned about
whether we can afford to run the "plato down" tapes if they
are turning all the slide projectors on and off!

       a and b will help. It seems that the tape could
send a lamp off command as well as anything else but that
alas would require re-doing the tapes.

        The main problem is with lamps turning on when
terminals are inactive but powered up. This most often
occurs at night at remote sites (the longer the phone
lines the more errors) although I'm sure it happens at
CU also. This would be helped by sending the proper
word at some interval to inactive stations.==_========_

        Somehow, in view of how cruddy the tapes work,
I wonder if a slidecff would accomplish anything,
considering that all I've ever seen is a blank screen, or
perhaps a few characters now and then... And the scanners
clicking on and off madly once in a while, interspersed
with errors... If you hold the button down, you might be
able to read something every minute or so...

Regarding the down tapes:

It amazes me that, connected to millions of dollars of
electronic gear, is a cheesey little Norelco cassette player
that is used to send the down message. I can't help but
believe that a slightly better tape machine could only
help the down messages. As am operator I know that even
cleaning the heads on that Norelco doesn't help much

Another note in the -It would be nice if- category.

It would be nice if the vector command had a continued
from using the ; as in draw or gdraw commands.
example:
       Convert   vector x?1,y?1,x?2,y?2
                  vector x?2,y?2,x?3,y?3
       to
                  vector x?1,y?1,x?2,y?2
                  vector ;x?3,y?3
Additional extensions of this type could allow for series
of vectors performed as in the draw commands using semi-
colons. Example: vector x?1,y?1,x?2,y?2;y?3,y?3;x?4,y?4....
I am sure you get the idea.

Well, if other people think it is a reasonable idea, is
there any chance for implementation in the near future?

1) You are right, it WOULD be nice...
2) No chance of immediate implementation
3) I will put it on the "it would be nice IF" list

   Note: far easier suggested than done, since would have
to completely rewrite both the condense and execution
routines...note that cannot use the draw stuff, because
-vector- has an additional argument, the vector arrowhead
size, which you perhaps forgot. Thanks for suggestion,
though,it was a good one.

---------- response 2

I am glad you approve of the suggestion. No, I did not
forget the arrowhead size parameter, although I did forget
to include it in the example. My thoughts were that for
a continued arrow, the size would only be entered for
the first arrowhead and would be assumed constant for those
which followed.

       This addition will (someday) also add consistency
from the TUTOR author's viewpoint.
        Can you give any hints about the other things on
your job board? These sort of tid-bits are very much

Steve, I checked into this.
The author save buffer begins at storage location
323 and continues for up to 322 words. The catch is======_===_ _____ __
that the editor contains built-in precautions against
crazy authors trying to jump into systems lessons with
odd things stored in their storage. So for any route
you might take into the editor, except from another
systems lesson such as notes, the entire storage is zeroed.
Also any route you take out of the editor, except for
the LAB1 key during editing, zeroes the storage. I am sure
that the systems people are working on ways to stop up
the exception.

   I should think that if one of more users can benefit
from a feature, then it should have merit to all. In this
case, I am sure that ANYONE writing a code generating
routine could benefit immeasurably from such a feature.
   Since all it is is loading it into storage, why not
take out all of the checks that the editor does so that
this would be possible.

there any NOT to implement this?

   Recent discussions about -circle- and -gcircle- have
led to the following suggestion. Please consider it and
reply either here or in p-notes if it affects you in any
way.

   It has been proposed that -circle- (and -circleb-)
which now has the form circle R,X,Y[,startarc,endarc]
be split into two parts...
   at     X,Y
   circle R [,startarc,endarc] R is in dots
This has the advantage of being easier to remember, being
able to put circles at the ends of drawn lines, being
able to put circles on graphs via -locate x,y- -circle R-,
plus several other not so obvious advantages.
   It has the disadvantages of using an extra word or
two in the code, requiring an automatic lesson conversion,
and a small possibility that a poorly-written lesson might
not convert correctly...

(Continued...please press LAB)

---------- response 1
  07/03     17.07     shirer       s

...circle vote continued

   Specifically, the conversion to the -at- -circle- intro-
duces a new margin setting, so anyone who depended on a
previous margin setting by beginning a new -write- after
a -circle- without an accompanying -at- would find the
next line beginning under the center of the circle. This
is bad programming and problably would not affect you
(since you write GOOD programs, right?)

   This would make possible a later -gcircle- which would
draw a circle with a radius scaled to the current x,y scales
(and yes, it would draw ellipses if scales are different!)

   We will NOT implement the above feature without a
clearcut approval from the Plato community. If you (plural)
reject this idea, -gcircles- may not be possible. If you
accept it, it could be done within a month and your
lessons would be converted automatically. Comments?

But please do not remove the capability of arcs with
off screen centers.
Such a conversion would destroy the operation of any
lesson which has circles with off screen centers.
(NOTE: It is very easy to create such an arc in the ID
option of the editor and never really realize that you
have used a circle whose center is off srceen.)

After having read the general notes in the previous
response, I would like a little clarification. First of
all, if "attachment" only occurs when the b and d options
are used, why can't the a and c options be made to work
with the inspect code only?
Also, why is the policy on this the same as it is on
printouts? Anything that can be done in an X-search
can be done in the editor X-option (although more slowly)
and this is available to anyone who can inspect a lesson.
As was mentioned earlier, such an option would make use
of some "system" lessons (such as catalog) easier and
more convienient.

Hmmmm.... I just did a two terminal test and discovered
that the file is not attached w/choice "a", as you said.

I suppose one should explore old notes to find out what
" the same policy as for prints" REALLY means.

---------- response 4

       Only one file is attached in options (b) and (d)
and that is the file which contains your list of lessons
to be searched. Lessons are not attached when they are
being searched.

       One of the reasons why the X-option is restricted
to those who have the change code is that it produces a
sufficient amount of disk overhead on the system.

     Requiring only the inspect code for a search also
opens up the possibility of a great malicious use of the
system. I can imagine some "author" making a little fun for
himself by searching for some character string through 320
lessons (in his own list) which do not have inspect codes.
A few records running like this could easily hamper disc
accessing for other users.

---------- response 5
  07/05     18.59     iezek       ames

But, if the inspect code were sufficient for the a and c
options only, that would make a maximum of 20 lessons that
could be searched at one time.

  Still, Mark, the X search takes an AWFUL lot of disk

I often want to look through a single lesson (or maybe two)
that I am 'using', but only have inspect privileges. Since
the X-option wont let me, I must use the editor. I think
the ¬$ of disk accesses excuse is a poor one for two
reasons: i) I'm going to do the I/O anyways (from the
editor), 2) The X-option can easily keep track (I would
think) of how much I/O I'm doing, and slow me down if it
is too much. I'd like to see a SLOW X-option that uses
the inspect code. This way I could twiddle my thumbs and
avoid mistakes rather than have to think and type (I too,
am lazy) !

  A property of 'published lessons' which might make
a major point in this suggestion awkward is the fact that
once published a lesson may not be modified. The idea
behind his suggestion is to recieve feedback about the
lesson. In order to allow a complete loop one would
have to have a backup of every lesson one publishes which 
one would like to alter according to this feedback.

---------- response 5
  07/07     07.57     maggs       law

I have been a party to a number of discussions of published
lessons. The idea has always been that they would be
lessons which had been tried and tested with students, so
that they would be unlikely to need immediate modification.
Even so it was assumed that the author would keep a backup
for making gradual improvements, and once a year or so come
out with a " new edition."

  Published lessons may not satisfy what is wanted here--
the desire to get quick feedback on a newly finished but
untested lesson which is sure to need changes.
---------- response 6

Yes, this request is for something other than what published
lessons were intended for. The most effective approach used
in the past seems to be contacting authors with similar
interests (via HELP notes if you can't find anyone listed
in the various publications and index files). AIDS has
the most recent details on such references. The helpful
inputs tend to be from those who have struggled with similar
problems. Al Avner

perhaps " sample" and " catalog" should be retained to
enable people to keep up to date on never material
and the " published" (ie, thoroughly tested) lessons
could be in a separate lesson called "library" (or

"sample" will not be retained after the "catalog of pub-
lished lessons" becomes available. However, "catalog" will
be retained as it contains all lessons in process as well as
finished.

We are in the process of putting the regular "catalog" into
the student mode and you will be able to search it for sub-
juct area and author which will be much more convenient for
the users.

By the way, an author who wishes to put his lesson into
the "catalog of published lessons" will be asked to input
the information on-line himself and one will be able to look
at the lesson in question immediately.

   It seems that whenever one attaches a dataset through
the dataset command, and not using a reserve command,
the dataset itself is unable to be edited from the author
mode page for as long as the dataset is attached.
 
   Likewise, if someone is editing a dataset, and you
try to attach it through the dataset command, the attach
fails, zreturn = 2, which indicates disk error.

And in some other simple tests, it seems that you can
attach a dataset (codeword dependent of course) from any
number of lessons running concurrently and be successful
in these attempts but once you try to go into the dataset
itself from the author mode page, it will not let you
and gives you two displays, the first of which telling you
that your dataset is being currently edited at site 31,
station 31 (this flashes by your eyes very quickly) and then
you are brought to a page which says that some or all of the
blocks in the dataset are being reserved and you will not
be allowed to enter the dataset except under -INSPECT ONLY-
privledges.

   And, no, I do not have any -reserve- commands in my
lessons, and yes, I tried this with my own dataset workspace
so I know that no one else is trying to play tricks on me.

Yessir, a game the whole family can play...

---------- response 2
  07/07     11.35     rader       s

a) There is only way to attach a dataset, and that is
   through the -dataset- command. I don't understand your
   reference to attaching a dataset through a -reserve-
   command.

b) Yes, datasets are currently marked as "attached" with a
   code that the editor interprets as site 31 station 31,
   to provide a system interlock on accessing the file--
   if we want to move it, for example. It also interlocks
   changing of codewords--you can't change them while the
   file is in use.

   The message that says that some blocks are reserved
   may or may not be accurate--it means that the editor
   is not going to permit you " change" access because
   somebody is using the file, and might indeed want to
   reserve some blocks.

---------- response 3
  07/07     14.09     bruce       research

   The point that I was trying to make in my original note
is that merely by attaching the dataset..

dataset newdset

the editor informs the user upon entering his dataset
from the author mode page that he has 'reserved' it,
and cannot edit it.
   Likewise, if I am editing my dataset, and try to attach
it thusly

dataset newdset
show zreturn

zreturn will be shown =2, which is listed as a disk error.

   It would seem that by merely attaching a dataset I have
not reserved it, and should not be locked out from editing.
Perhaps I am wrong.. Kevin

---------- response 4
  07/07     17.40     rader       s

You are wrong. "Reserving" is a different operation from
attaching; the editor is set up to permit single editor
operation--datasets are set up to permit multiple editor
operation. The two do not mix. As I said before, the
message may be inaccurate--perhaps we can improve the
message.

There is a very helpful lesson in which you might find

"notes".When you get that lesson's main index, press
"f". Then choose a time period in which you think the

The main purpose of changing these chars to show slanted

   We worked on revising the size 1 line drawn characters
for probably a week in order to make as many as possible
identical to the wired in (size 0) characters (and to
make it so ALL the wired in characters could be sized).
The " size chars" editor let us compare the line drawn
chars with the wired- in ones and also see the newly
designed chars in various sizes. In order for some
chars to look at all decent in larger sizes one must
give up on following every crook in the character so
size 1 matches size 0. Some of the problem also traces
to imperfections in the hardware algorithm for drawing
lines! No claim is made to "bestness" of the current
line drawings--but an attempt was made to match as best
as possible size 1 with size 0 (with thought given also
to appearance in larger sizes).

  We used to be able to do fairly accurate timings of
output via the -echo- command. Could there be an -echo-
implimented with _no tag_ which would allow the echoing
of some innocuos key that doesn't allow users to control
branching after exit form a lesson?
  Timings of output via -catchup- don't work because there
is no feedback. In case this point is not clear, it is
a fact that -catchup-s computes a 'good' estimate of the
amount of pending output and stops processing for that long.
This results in a measurement that is very poor relative
to the -echo- type of absolute feedback.

The basic claim is for faster learning rather than faster
typing speed. One might also consider that, since this
learning speed is partly due to use of "favored" fingers for
the most frequently used letters, the standard configuration
is beneficial in giving needed exercise to otherwise
underutilized digits.

   Thank you, Ruth, for -route resignon-!!
When the student STOP1's out of the lesson, and presses
NEXT (or whatever) to return to the router, is the router's
IEU excecuted? It is a 'still-signed- on' return, but you
said it's just like the student had signed off. Also, I
take it the command only works with student records and/or
if a router is attached?

After the student presses stop1, when is the -route finish-
unit executed? Is it executed _before_ the student sees the
page giving him the resignon option? I.e., if he chooses to
re-sign-on, and enters the router at the -route resignon-
unit, has the -route finish- unit already been executed?

It is EXACTLY as if the student had signed all the way
off the system, executing the route finish unit, etc.;
then signed back on the system, going through the router
ieu... The number of sessions on is incremented, multiple
records have their variables cleared, student records
have been returned to disk. Just think of it as a way
of saving the student the trouble of typing his name,
course, and password again.

(In answer to the other question -- the -route- command
works only in a router.)

I just realized I had misunderstood a significant detail:
I thought the -route resignon- specified a unit in the
router to enter if the student elected to stay on. It
seems that NO unit is specified; the student reenters
at the beginning of the router, or not at all. Hmmmmmmm....

---------- response 5
  07/07     12.26     michael       english
This would seem to be an argument for adding a new return
value to *backout* -- or via some other way -- so that a
router can tell if a student is re-entering via the
resignon feature or not. This would allow a router to
branch around its"Welcome to this session" routine.
Having such a flag seems essential if people are going to
use the resignon feature meaningfully.

initial lesson     $$ done if last student reenters?

Can the router be condensed out from under the student while
on the resignon page? If the student is the last person to
leave the router, does sitting on the resignon page hold up
updating the datafile? Does the system press STOP1 after
a student has sat an inordinate amount of time on that page?

Right -- the student isn't really anywhere when he is on

Chalk that one up to the method the terminal uses to figure
out which dots have to be turned on to draw lines. Since
the dots in the panel are straight-up-and-down-and-sideways,
if you want to draw lines at funny angels then a funny
zig-zag pattern of dots has to be drawn to approximate a
line in that direction.

---------- response 2
  07/08     17.33     warner       iu

The characters aren't actually drawn differently. It's
just that the PLATO screen has its dots in a square array.
That means that a line that appears (magnified ) in
horizontal form as this
? oooooooooooooo??
might look like this when rotated 30¬0:
? oo?ˆoo?ˆoo?ˆoo?ˆoo?ˆoo????
which just naturally looks sloppier than the "straight"
line. You probably notice this effect in a small way
with small circles. Because characters are smaller,
they tend to look even sloppier. Also remember that
the rotated values for the lines must be rounded off to
integers before PLATO will accept them!

I think it would suffice to have a feature for new user
records similar to that for new lesson files. That is,
until the new user goes "I" (or LAB from "user") he/she will
be taken right past the author mode page to his/her
record data (-talk-, -ext-, etc). This would insure
initialization, or at least awareness, especially for new
authors. After that point, the author is on his/her own to
be aware of the status or these options.

Personally, i don't like the idea of having to wait the
extra half second or so for all this proposed new stuff to
plot on the author mode page.

securely oriented to basic, important stuff (like how the

I don't think it is a major problem. After all if he is a
new author he is probably better off not having you confuse
him. Also there is a tendency for new authors like myself
who learn all the short cuts and not hard core programming.
That is the more expierienced  author shows too much so he
doesn't learn it from plato. Also if the guy can't figure
it out he is probably better off exploring plato on his own.
I however think a change such as this would produce a bunch
of neurotic authors with little to do but turn off their
talk option.....

Just wanted to comment on the remark about the borrowed
lessons. As i understand it the purpose of PLATO is
not only provide CAT but to make the material available to
all schools thus providing a network; thus by this sharing
of lessons eliminate the duplication of efforts in the same
areas and thus developing a curriculum sooner by the pooling
of resourses of the  various schools. Also allowing the
expertise that might be availible at another school be
availible to others via the pLATO system. I would think
that with the tight budgets the education has currently
that we would all be willing to share inorder to provide
the best possible educational system.

I don't think that is what was meant by the original note:
the question of "borrowing"seems to be a vexed one in
computer work, from what I have been hearing. Making
materials available to the general public is one thing:
text book writers do that, and they get paid for it, too,
 and the book belongs to them, and they are paid when
material from it is used. One would expect the same to
be eventually true in cAT!

There used to be a bit-split function in -library-.

It was -bitsplt- and could be used to double the informa-
tion storage capacity of a word. One could refer to the
-bitsplt(x)-, and since the function was recursive, one
could quadruple the storage capacity of a particular bit
by referring to the -bitsplt(bitsplt(x))-.

The only problem with the function was that there were
no right- and left-handed versions of it, and one had
to address both halves of the bit with the same function.
This led to ambiguous storage and retrieval results, and
the function was eventually removed from -library-. (For

Your basic bit is a tough little devil and the CDC hardware
tended to wear excessively when the bitsplitter was in
service. The newer model Shannon-Weaver diamond toothed
logic unit provides harder hardware, but its design also
makes the software harder.
    Hot bits split somewhat easier and the Ashby-Wiener
roaster has been used with some success to provide a soft
bit which can then then be split with the usual soft
hardware or with hard software, in the event you happen to
have one of the above mentioned SWDT logic units. Cooked
bits have a severely reduced vitamin content however, and
are suspected to cause cancer in rats.

that the site directors can eliminate the escape from
the autosignon during those periods. Otherwise the news
spreads fast that you can press shift-stop and get on
anyway. This would greatly facilitate classroom scheduling
and help control cafeteria usage.
    Even if you tell people when and when not to use the
terminals, they inevitably take all they can get. I have

About the only possibility would be to provide a key (DATA
is a popular "replot" key) which replots the screen. This
is a drawback (and a great advantage) of the plasma screens,
since nothing has to "remember" what is on the screen. This
way, the computer does not have to bother with constantly
refreshing the screen, taking enormous amounts of computer
time (which is short enough already!). Once the plasma
screen is turned on, it stays on until turned off.
However, this also means that it has no idea what to replot
unless you specifically tell it.

   No hope. The computer "remembers" only enough data to
retransmit the last few words in case of a single parity
error. Evidently your line is bad enough to cause double-
bit errors which are unrecoverable. I sympathize with you
since my (usual) remote site also has a mickey-mouse
telephone company which often has the red light flashing
like the advertisement for a bawdy house.

  There is a 1 in 2ˆ6 chance of an error being the type
that will cause a full screen erase. (this is double

  If you have millions of errors, 2-3 erases a day is

A reduction in line errors requires either better phone

I have recently implemented a feature of the Computer
Science router which I suggest would be generally
applicable in many situations, and therefore, might be
useful as a general Plato feature.?
The basic problem is that sometimes, a lesson ought to be
varied slightly depending on some information best known
only to the instructor. In other words, when setting up
a lesson sequence, the instructor might wish to say
something like "use lesson zork, modification 2", where
"zork" understands "modification 2" to specify a certain
variation in the presentation of the material, such as
the type of examples used. (In our case, it might be a
variation in the dialect of FORTRAN being taught.)?

In other words, it ought to be possible for the instructor,
in the curriculum options, to specify a "parameter" for a
lesson. The lesson would then interpret that parameter;
the meanings of various parameter values would have to be
explained somewhere, perhaps within the lesson but shown
only to authors or instructors.?
This could probably be implemented the way -score- is
implemented: a command to be executed by the router to
set the parameter value before jumping to the lesson; and
a system variable to carry the value, which would be read
by the instructional lesson. The operational difference
with -score- is that the parameter value would not be
developed by the lesson; it would be specified by the
instructor and stored as a property of the lesson in a
particular sequence.?

The C.S. implementation passes the parameter chosen by
the instructor in n-variables, of course. We have
more or less arbitrarily limited the parameter to 5 bits,
just because that much space happened to be available.

have to enter at different points. (Say, run through

that it is a LOT easier than writing one's own router.
Every now and again, I'll say "hey, sys person, given any

This capability would be a necessity for the success
of the proposed "published lessons", but with the further
extension that the using instructor be able to not only
specify that the lesson be modified, but that he (with
his team of programmers) be able to actually provide
the modifications.

I cannot imagine that the author of a lesson will be able
to specify in advance all the customizing features for the
future users of the published lesson. And it is quite
common for teachers to specify additions, corrections,
or selections when using a textbook, for example.

I can't imagine how the suggestion I made could possibly
lead to the degree of flexibility requested in the previous
response. What that really takes is a customized version
of a lesson. What I have in mind is more along the lines
of the parameter accepted by Warner's lesson "help", for
example--the coded numbers he expects in n30.
It can't really be all that complicated. I've already
implemented the idea, going as far as a non-system feature
can go. Ruth Chabay, would you care to comment?

Not really a viable suggestion. Consider a lesson with
3 different two-possibility modifications. A 3-bit
parameter will do the job, but it would take _8_ different
entry units to do it as Rader suggests. More important,
the jumpout code would then have to be open or have to
match; that just won't do in the general case.

It can't be executed as a _TUTOR_ lesson. The code in "net"
is COMPASS code which is used to run the PLATO system. It
has no value as an "instructional" file, but without it
you'd have a dead terminal.

A couple problems with the new resignon feature.

If your are IN the router an 'end lesson' , 'jumpout q'
or just finishing the last unit all give you the DATA or
STOP1 page, while pressing STOP1 signs you off. It would
seem that end lesson and jumpout q in the router should
send you to press next to begin. Why else would you have
them in a router. At present the only way you can end a
session when in the routher is with a "press stop1" command
(or pressing stop1 of course). Can this be changed.

Second, could a time limit be put on the DATA or STOP1 page,
as im sure ill have lots of students leaving that on the
terminal thinking they are signed off and other students
will be able to get into their records.

  According to Ruth Chabay (G.Note -$310, R3) there is a
time limit of 3 minutes on the "DATA or STOP1" page. If
a student does nothing in this time, he is thrown to the
"Press NEXT to Begin" page.

   Why it is that when you create a new block, you are

This would allow the author to press -next- to go into

And likewise for insert display and etc..

   In terms of number of key presses:

If one were put into Insert mode to begin with one would
eliminate 2 key presses.
   This is not hte case if one is going into IS or ID.
In this case one would press BACK and type in the letters.
This would be a waste of 1 key-press.
TOTAL SCORE: SUGGESTION 2 STATUS QUO 1
Assuming that each of the above things are done with a
50: probability. Personally, I begin by Insert mode
more than 50: of the time however the suggestion would
be advantagous down to a 33: probability of beginning
in Insert mode. The probability of this is much higher than
33: in my estimation.

       I agree that the COPY1 key would be nice if it would
write your lesson for you. However I have always felt that
the author should have to do something. Maybe instead of a
COPY1 key have the author write the lesson and then insert
a command at the beginning or the lesson that tells the
condenser to rewrite the code so that it executes the way
the author wanted it to, not the way he wrote it. If the
system decides to add this command. I suggest that it be
called the 'work' command. It would be a great way to get
bugs out lessons.

P.S. Once the work command is ready, I suggest that all

Command -timer- is great! It'll make some nice router
control features possible, as will -timel-, which I assume
is coming soon.?
In order to help a lesson make an intelligent decision
about which way to sequence a routed student, how about
a system variable *timleft* which can be used by the route_d_
lesson to know how much time is left before the timed return
jumpout is executed? Such information could be used to
affect which choices are made available to the student, how
many drill items are given, etc.

---------- response 1

The way -timer- is currently implemented, it would be
rather difficult to give you such information, but it
could be done if there were sufficient need for it.

Are you really asking for a way to tell an instructional
lesson to give a short course instead of a everything it
has? If so, Dr. Friedman's suggestion of passing a
parameter to the lesson might be a better way to do it.
Indeed, -timel- is in the works. The only thing to
be done before it can be released it to make it do
a -helpop- type jump, instead of the current -help-
type jump it is doing. This requires that -pause-
allow -helpop- type jumps.

      I can not reproduce your problem. I went to the
6th part of a 12 part lesson, went into block, pressed
BACK, and found myself still looking at part 6. Can
you reproduce the "error"?

  I think your problem is that you have the functions of
the keys mixed up. BACK from a block will take you to
the block page of the part that block is in, and "-" will
move you back one part, "+" forward one part, etc. BACK
from the block page will take you to the author page.
Pressing a number will take you to that part ¬$.

To clarify this issue:
If you are editing in a charset or common block in any
part other than part 1 you _will_ be returned to part 1
when pressing BACK. Although this is a minor problem it
would be nice if BACK could return you to the proper
block page from charsets and commons as it does from other
types of blocks.

---------- response 4
  07/14     13.05     berger       mfl

Jim,

The reason that BACK from a charset or common takes you
to the first part of the lesson is that the charset editor
and common editor lessons do a simple jumpout to return
you to your block directory page.

I'm not sure that it's worth the trouble to change.

---------- response 5
  07/14     13.19     jim g       reading

Oh You're so right, Berger!

It's only confusing as hell to new authors and only drives
some of us the wall when editting many charset blocks in
multi-part lessons (as well as common blocks).

Obviously you are right, it can't be worth the trouble to
change, I mean, what the hell, it doesn't bother you so
it's not worth the trouble. (Sheesh!)

---------- response 6
  07/14     14.51     kaufman       mfl
it makes it enormously tedious at times to be bounced back
to the first part after editing the first, then second, then
third, then...etc. block of a bunch of common blocks as I
for one am doing a lot at times - it may be the case that
it is not considered worth the extra status bits needed to
keep track of what part of your lesson you jumpout'd to the
common/dataset editor from, especially if such status bits
are scarce, but it certainly would be convenient...!

But since you aren't on the systems staff, why not let

John R.,

1. My response wasn't the first, so if systems staff
passed over this note because there had already been
a response, that's not due to _my_ response.

2. My response is factual - so I fail to see what jus-
tification you have for complaining about it.

3. If it is more pleasing to you, I can fake a "system
response" message at the top of the page - that seems to
be more important to you than the content of the note.

The -NOTES- message was put there to inform you that you
have p-notes that you have not looked all the way through
yet.
If you don't like the message, why don't you just read
your notes? If you have so many of them saved that it is
a pain ot hit keys to get ot the last one, why don't you
save and delete some fot he old ones? Otherwise, why should
four or five quick keypresses bother you that much?

PLATO is one of the few places I know of where someone
does something intended to be helpful, and inevitably
someone complains.

you had?

See "aids" / DATA "dialogues" for a complete writeup of
-concept-, -vocabs-, -endings-, flags set, use of phrases,
continuation of -concept- for "synonymous" ideas, etc, etc.

For example, you might want to use synonymous -concept-s
to allow for variations in sentence construction: 'The
chicken crossed the road' and 'The road was crossed by
the chicken'. i've also found it useful to use a
    -specs  okxvocab,okcap-
so that the zillions of possible "ignorable" words don't
have to be included in the -vocabs-, and so the student
can capitalize the beginning of "important" (vocabulary)
words. If "aids" and a test unit or two don't answer your
questions, drop me a personal note and I'll try to help.

command would allow the author to transfer text from his
lesson space to the notes file. This 'insert note' (IN)
lesson and bring the code he wants to insert in a note
to the top of the page. Then he would type INx, where x
is the number of lines he wants to save. Then the editor
would go to the notes file. Here the author could insert
the saved code in a note with the IS command.
    This feature would allow and author to save a note,
and at a later time insert that note in another note
instead of having to refer back to it. Or an author
could insert some code that is not acting properly in a
note, and see if someone else can find out what is wrong.

1) These will NOT affect the way indexed or segmented

2) Yes indeed, they are faster than a doto loop if

   speed, but the automatic bounds checking and the
   more powerful -calc- features that this makes

Also: one type of none display code which does belong in

a display, hit a key to begin a touch command, and then
touch the display areas to be active. Pressing -back- would
end input for that particular touch command. I know this

Considering that it has always been felt (and stated) that
disk accesses are the Big Sticky Problem in implementing
so many things, I was wondering why no one ever thought to
install more than one disk controller so that more than
one disk operation could be in progress at once. Is there
no chance of changing the side door adapter to allow for
two or more disk-ecs channels to run?

---------- response 1
  07/15     18.37     midden       p 

The side door adapter is being done away with in regards
to disk accesses. As to more than one disk controller,
money is hard to come by. Right now plans are being
carried out to get more space for disk drives (A remodeling
of the old Plato III computer room). Also if two disk
controllers were connected, I wonder how in the hardware
one controller could access disks hooked onto the other
controller. (i.e. one won't be able to use the others
wire connections. Hardware doesn't come like that
too often)

  07/15     23.34     rader       s

O'Brien is correct that we can multiply our disk accesses
by getting more channels/controllers working. We are aware
of this. As Marshall says, however, it all does cost money.
Now if you were building your own dream machine, you could
add another controller or so--you need two ppu's per
controller to get your money's worth (1 to 1 interlace)--
and so 2 or 3 controllers might be possible...and if you
buy more ppu's, many more. You will obviously find a
shortage of cpu eventually, assuming you look at the data.

As to the redundancy question that Marshall raises, many
of our drives (not to mention our controller) happen to
be dual-access--so the hardware work for many things has
been done.

And we are indeed getting rid of the Side Door Adapter--and
getting better error recovery and more versatile operation
(and lower lease cost) at the same time.

---------- response 3
  07/16     01.08     blomme       s

   To state part of a personal prejudice: the move
to "do away with " the side door adapter is also bringing
with it the "benefits" of quite a few man months worth of
re-programming to do (in complicated fashion) with 2 ppu's
what we are already doing with 1 ppu. As to error recovery,
I yield to anyone else who has statistics--my own
impression is that most of the disk troubles have been
due to massive disasters at the disk controller level
(or just plain non-functioning drives)...but it is indeed
true that having to handle each sector of data individually
also makes it possible to utilize some of the fancy error
recovery techniques available, which is not possible under
the "all-or-nothing" arrangement we have with the side
door adapter.
   We have to have another port to ecs for another computer
some day and there has turned out to be little alternative
to removing the side door.

From my hours on PLATO, I have assertained that the STOP

1) Aborts output generated and not sent.

2) Sets the screen to x=0 and y= last y-16 at the next
   timeslice.

3) Changes the mode one is in (sometimes).

4) Enables the touch pannel if pressed twice.

5) Changes -key- in a computation sequence in -backgnd-
   whereas other keys change -key- in a computation
   sequence only in -foregnd-.

6) Forces a timeslice if one is auto-broken beyond the

The DATA key toggle for replace to insert and insert to
replace is on the help pages and has been since the new
pages were put in.
The "c" option searches for whatever begins the line, not
just commands, True this is what it is often used for but
that is not how the option works. The example given uses
a command search to give the idea of how it works. But
to state that it searches for commands only is untrue.

The first response to this note left me with the impression
(especially upon rereading the editor helps, where it says
that xT and cT bring up the line beginning with T) that cT
would bring up whatever line started with T. A simple
test shows that the cT option brings up the line ONLY if
the tag is in the command field, and will not bring up T
if it is a continued calc, write, etc.

Granted it does work with tags that are not commands,
but only if they are in the command field.

I can see how the present wording might be confusing to
new authors.

  07/16     12.55     warner       iu

A suggestion to at once make PLATO more easily accessible
to students, and reduce the amount of overhead:
Create a new user type - "universal'. There would only
be one universal signon possible to a course, and it
would work like a multiple with this exception--
When a student types in a name that does _not_ match
any name listed in the course, he is signed in as a
universal user with 'name' in his student bank set
to whatever he typed in WELCOME TO PLATO (with
appropriate put's). The student would then go to
the course router or to the restart lesson specified
in the universal records.

---------- response 1
  07/16     12.59     warner       iu

Once the user signs on, his records are not returned to
disk, just like a multiple.
There are two major advantages to this. First, it allows
much more flexible entry procedures. Instead of memorizing
two pieces of information, name and course, in order to
reach a multiple signon, the student only has to remember
the course, and could simply type his own name to enter.
Second, for lessons that store student records in datafiles
or common rather than student banks, it would allow a small
1-part, 6-student course to serve an unlimited number of
different students, and keep them straight without complex
programming.
I would be interested in comments on this idea.

Teaching students how to signon is one of the most
difficult aspects of the use of PLATO with large classes.
The most common problem seems to be that the name a
student types just isn't what is on the university
class roster. For sometime I have favored an option that
would give the student a message written by the instructor
if his name was not found in the course. This would
make it possible, for example, to advise the student
to try just his last name if that is the way the roster
was set up or indicate who to contact for assistance.

        I am not in favor.
1) Idiots would undoubtedly use obscene names
2) If I mis-type my signon name, I get signed on into
somewhere where I don't particularily want to be, and
the datafile would fill with trash like
        fulller - uimc
        fuler - uimc, etc signons...
3) Worse, "inventive" types would make a profession of
signing on 10?ˆ5?? times just _to_ fill the datafile with cute
messages...

The "advantages" warner claims would result through this
feature are already available through the "multiple" signon
-- if the problem is with remembering two pieces of infor-
mation, simply put the multiple name/course somewhere where
the student will see it.  And remember that multiple records
ARE returned to disk -- not the variables, but the last
time on, date, etc info!

I imagine you could design a routine to get the student's
name...something like

write   What is your name?

Even with direct instructions "type xxx then type yyy"
many get lost and are misled by the request "type your
name". I would favor an optional help page for
each site that wants to design their own, and which could
be branched to from the Welcome page, or upon an "error"
in typing name and course. Possibly the main features
of Warner's request could be obtained from an option in the
help section which would allow him to auto-signon into a
multiple record.

At any rate, some work should be done to allow one to
introduce himself to PLATO more easily. Should I also
be so bold as to ask for a multiple author record?

   Fred Ebeling actually built such a device--so yes,
such an automatic sign-in card-in-a-slot device has
not only been thought of but a working prototype
built long ago. The idea was to have sort of an id
card with user's picture on it (as well as name,course,
and code word entries stored in a non-(eyesight)-readable
form). Contact Fred for more info.
   There is no doubt that we want this system to be
as easy to use and responsive as possible--which is one
of the reasons that signing-on does not involve used id
numbers, social security numbers, etc. Hopefully some
improvements will be possible, but it seems that the
need for privacy and password type protection in some
form or other is likely to remain.
   Restrictions on computer space/time and terminal
availability are likely to limit the likelihood of any
general student or author signons for a while yet.

   The request was that I reprogram my lesson so that users
coming from lesson sample not execute dataon commands in
my lessons that are listed in sample.

   First, this seems to contradict previous statements
I have seen that sample is not designed for student use.
If sample is not meant for students, there should be
no need to have special code in listed lessons to deal
with students.

  Second, if my lessons are to be used by students, it
would seem appropriate that any student users be exposed
to the full philosophy of the lesson, including for
instance the opportunity to record comments in a data
file for later consideration by the instructor who thought
they should use the lesson.

Yes, "sample" is not intended for student use and requests
have been made to this effect many times, but people on the
system ignore the request. When we restricted the use of
"sample" to authors only, there was a great "hue and cry"
about it. "sample" will disappear as soon as the "Catalog of
Published Lessons" appears, but unfortunately that has been
a long time coming. If any author whose lessons are accessed
by "sample" wishes not to follow the suggestion in my memo,
that is quite all right.

The problem is that some lessons accessed by "sample"
generate an awful lot of data. If an author wishes to

Any student or multiple record accessing sample should have
its data options turned off. Of what significance is the
torrent of data that such records produce? Most of it
cannot be interpreted without a working knowledge of the 
lessons which generated it. Unless you are keeping a
"number-of-lessons-accessed" measure -- which is a garbage
score -- why collect data from such records?

Lessons that are in "sample" should be in a "publishable"
from which means that they stand alone, have no
special checks in them, and can be transferred to
another PLATO system and be expected to run without
complications. We have had special checks put in lessons
in the past, and in every case after a few years such
checks caused problems since they no longer applied.
Term "sample" is such an example.

I think that it would be very bad programming practice
to inhibit data collection only for users who accessed
a lesson through "sample". A problem caused by the
missuse of "sample" should not be solved by adding
special code to lessons.

the content there already with the appropriate feedback

Conversion is probably not useful unless the systems

redoing the lessons. The additional capabilities of

The closest to sucessful conversions which were automatic
were non-lesson stuff. IBM has had conversions from some
of COBOL, FORTRAN and ALGOL to PL/1, but since PL/1 is
a superset of these languages (nearly anyway), it is
more modest an accomplishment than others mentioned,
especially since none of these languages feature any
builtin heuristics.

What do you mean? A computer tape? Or, via a tape recorder
of some sort connected to the terminal?

If you mean the former, the answer is probably going to be
its possible, but not likely to be done. Disk storage is
much more efficient.

If you mean the latter, "I dunno", but "fritz" of "ames"
is looking for an answer to the same question. You might

  I meant the former.
   
  Disk is much more efficient, but also very costly. We
have here files that have no purpose, but will within the
next few years. It would be nice to purge them and make
the disk space available for other users and then recreate
the files at a later date, after reading the tape directly
onto the files.

  It seems as if there would be a great deal of use for
such an option. I am sure that other users have fealt a 
need for long term storage other than disk. It would mean
a little more hassle for the operator and alot of expense,
but I would imagine in the long run, it would be worthwhile.

We have no current plans to store users files on tapes and
read them back on to disk at the users request. We do not
even have any plans to store users files on off-line disks
and retrieve them on demand. The latter would be a 
better match to the rest of our operations--the management
and space problems associated with storing and retrieving
lots of tapes have been studiously avoided here.

Another consideration--would you want your off-line lesson
to be converted as we change the language--if so, there
are added problems of keeping track of the off-line lessons;
if not, the lessons will not be much use when you want to
restore them.

   The word is closer to "absurd" and applies to the
idea of storing "off-line" lessons on tape! Bob Rader
has already pointed out the really major problems of
keeping track of such things, to up-date such lessons,
etc. If you think for just a short while you will
realize that the cost of operators' time in chasing
tapes around and programmers' time to develop a complete
inventory and cataloging system for tapes exceeds the
cost of lesson space very very greatly.
   Under special conditions and upon special request,
lessons or data can be dumped to tape--we have NO plans
to "restore" lessons from tape or punched cards!
   I am somewhat hard pressed to understand how a lesson
that is of no use now will suddenly become useful 3 years
from now...besides which both the hardware and software
will hopefully be greatly improved by then!

Stone, Hody: I have made this suggestion several times,
very seriously, for reasons similar to yours, and always
have been turned down with the arguments put forth in the
system responses here.?
I would like to add, though, that storing some files off-
line (e.g., on tape, which would be most economical) makes
a lot more sense (to me) than our system people claim.
Such files would include lessons once needed. but which now
are inactive and likely to remain so; one frequently is
reluctant to destroy lessons which are essentially obsolete,
preferring to keep them in some machine readable form.
Also, there are datafiles, datasets, and commons contain-
ing information laboriously collected which one may wish
to process again, but not for a long while.?
This is the only system I know that insists that all data
exist on-line or not at all. Can Plato really claim to be
right and all others wrong?

---------- response 7
  07/18     13.35     friedman       csa

It need not be a big drag to the operations staff to have
to catalog and keep track of which lessons are off-line
and on which tapes.  One advantage of tapes is that they're
cheap (a good quality 2400' reel of tape costs less than
$10); another is portability.  If Plato files could be
dumped to and restored from tapes, the user could be
responsible to provide (or buy from Plato or from CSO) the
necessary tape, and could also be required to take the
tape away with him/her.  And certainly, a turnaround from
request-to-restore to accomplishment of a week or so would
be suitable.  As to programming time, I could write the
darn program for you in a week"?
WHY NOT???

---------- response 8
  07/18     17.50     blomme       s

   I seriously doubt that "one week" would suffice for
anyone to write a complete filing and record keeping system
for tapes along with the documentation of which conversion
routines must be applied to the lesson and the preservation
and execution of those conversion routines when the lesson
is restored.
   Frankly, another "benefit" of the current situation
is that people have to decide whether something is useful
or not and the system does not become littered with
obsolete junk preserved only because it is possible to do
so.
   It could be that plato has made a mistake in differing
from all other systems in providing on-line editing and
testing of material and a graphical display (and viewing
these services as the essential ones to be worked on
and improved).  We happily leave the card and tape buffs
to use the standard computer center operations.

Since when is plato the _only_ system that offers on line
editing and testing (you DID contrast plato to 'all others')
do you think this is the only time sharing system in the
world? other computer systems can support graphics terminals
also. Lastly, other computer systems do NOT restrict
themselves to 'card and tape buffs'. Other systems allow
interactive _and_ batch, they allow use of cards, tape _and_
disc _and_ plotters _AND_ all sorts of other things. Plato
offers ONLY disc storage and terminal I/O. THEREFOR
plato is the less flexible in comparrison to many other
systems.  True it is many ways easier to use, but not always.
Some claim it is cheaper,but users cant really evaluate
this claim because CERL will not provide information on what
Plato is costing the university. I dont see how you can
deny, Rick, ...continued

that what you call 'conventional' facilities are in fact
more powerful and flexible than plato. They can do just
about everything plato can do, the only differences are
they require more experienced programmers (which plato
is more and more requiring also) and cannot handle as many
terminals (students) simutaneously.  All you people
who are so "wow wee"'d by PLATO should start looking around
at developments in the computer industry and reevaluate
platos overall sophistication, power, flexibility, etc.

   See Xerox Research in Palo Alto for some REAL graphics
and lots of computer power at a terminal (of course the
price is sort of unknown since they aren't marketing;
also they really have no inter-terminal communications
at all).  See Lawrence Livermore for a massive system
of teletypes (mainly) with enormous central computer power.
See Dartmouth for a campus-wide involvement in computing.
See any University computer center for card/tape type
processing with some remote entry ports (and  usually a
few hour turn-around time on "express" type jobs).  I
do not feel that plato solves all the world's computing
needs and that all other services are poor or outdated.
   As regards possible "off-line" storage of lessons/data,
this is a possibility in the future--but it will be on
disks (or some future cheap random access mass storage
device), not on tapes and cards.

I understand the arguments for keeping lessons on disc (and
agree for the most part).  However, for those projects which
collect a lot of data for research and evaluation purposes,
it would be extremely advantageous to be able to dump
data (from datasets and commons) to tape.  There are many
large-scale, debugged statistical packages available on
the 360 which are not available on PLATO (like SOUPAC or
Multivariance).  Being able to store one's long-term data
on tape makes a lot of sense if you want to make use of
the statistical facilities on other systems.

(I have heard it rumored that there will soon be a hook-up
between PLATO and the DEC-10 and thus to the 360.  This
would solve the above problem.  What is the status on this
project?)

For the record, Rick, I did NOT make an offer to write
an entire file dumping, cataloging, restoring system in
one week; I agree that would be an absurd statement.?
But all that I believe is needed is the ability to dump
a Plato file to tape, and to restore it from tape.
After being dumped, it would be deleted from the (disk)
system, and would no longer exist to Plato.  When/if it
is restored, an appropriate file would be created in the
Plato disk system, and the contents of the tape file
dumped to it.  TRIVIAL!  Really!! No cataloging needed,
no complex filing system, user responsible for storage...

Modification to touch inputs:

Previously, it was possible for a tough input to be
coming in from a terminal while a -disable- signal was
being sent to the terminal. This often required extra
code to ignore tough keys that came in just after a
-disable-. Now when a -disable- or -enable- command
is executed, the system sets a flag indicating new
terminal state, and if a touch (or external) input comes
in while the terminal is supposedly disabled, the key
is ignored (-press- keys in the touch-external range
will also be ignored when the terminal is -disabled-).
Also, when STOP is pressed, the appropriate enable/disable
signal is now sent to the terminal.

This should be on the prime time version of Plato soon.

   In the past week or two, I have seen many cases
where pressing a key--firmly and when nothing had been
done for a while (i.e., no possibility of being in
an auto-break limbo)--has produced no result. Keys
appear to be getting lost--and I don't mean that processing
in the editor doesn't get done sometimes after 10 dozen

I have had this problem too, and it has happened at
many different terminals. I also had problems with
pressing a key and getting a different key in return.

        for example:
In the editor I was inserting a line of code in a block
and pressed NEXT. The arrow did NOT move down to the
next line as expected but I received an "h" at the end
of the line which I was currently editing. Also, at
execution time, I pressed BACK, and it would appear that
nothing had happened but then I pressed an alphabetic
key (ie. a-z) and it appeared that somehow I had gotten
a carriage return,and that letter was at the 1st character
position of the next line following the arrow. This has
been known to happen either with a carriage return of if
the STOP key is pressed at an arrow. Extremely mystifying.
Also, I lost the "n" in "return, three lines up while typing
this note.

What a wide selection of problems! I think the extra "next"
keys might be traceable to a problem with a touch panel--
maybe? In any case, extra keys are not the problem in focus
here.

We have documented (thanks to Sherwin Gooch) over the past
3-4 weeks that "$", for example, will echo as "."--but that
the correc_t key is in your buffer!===_

Thus if you try and erase the erroneous character, the
computer will use the true character--leaving hash on your
screen.

The important part of this (for us) is that it means this
is an error that occurs sometime after the correct key is
received by the computer--it is on the output side of PLATO.

The tapes are indeed very important. When the system is
down it is difficult to get informaton about when
it will be back for the very good reason that people who
know are off working on the problem. Tapes need to be

        Even when a recorded message is running, it is
difficult to get information on when plato will be alive
again. More than once I have seen plato go down, and the
recorded massage starts up. Sometimes I can even read the
part that says plato service will be down for thirty
minutes. Low and behold, plato comes back five minutes
later. Notice that the thirty minute message is recorded,
yet real time proceeds as usual. If the message were
always correct, plato would never come up, and we don't
want that, now do we!

What quality is the tape recorder involved? When we can
get perfect replays with a simple casette record locally,
I have my doubts. Has any kind of driver been tried in
the tape recorder plato interface? There is no good reason

If you saw the tape recorder they use, Sellers, you would

fact, I suspect it cost less than $29.95. I don't know if
they have tried replacing the recorder, but  i have been
wondering ever since I saw it whether that migt be part of
the problem: if the tapes are in a loop, why not get a

Missing a full-screen erase hurts the most when you
have just typed R9 <NEXT> in the editor. The only way
to clear the screen is a -BACK- (hence wasted keypresses).

(After an F9 or such you can always do an "n" so that's
not as bad.)

Suggestion: until they find the bug that causes full-screen
erases to miss, put an extra -erase- command at the

terminal monitoring (both on site 27 and another site)
but the missing chars were not in the same place for

typing along, when it appears I have missed a char (a
period "." was just inserted between a char (a.char) and
attempting to erase it failed though "a" and "char" did
if fact erase!) The information displayed (it just did
it there on information, "informtion" (lost "a") attempt
to erase, erases letters as system knows them, not as
they were displayed on the screen) is not that which is
erased. It happens frequently, though it is most noted
when the attempt to erase is done in mode erase, rather
than with a full char erase.

As the author of the lesson in which the original problem
was noted, I can give further information on the details of
what was being output.  To produce a solid block, a line of
"full" characters (i.e., all dots on) was written in a doto
loop. The full character was loaded in the "," slot of the
font character set.
The result (which is still occurring) is that lines are
randomly short. The loss of two characters seems to occur
more often than that of a single character. And as reported
by Fritz, the character loss occurs independently for the
monitoring and the monitored terminals.

  I have no problems. I went into my common (966 words)

while monitoring, I asked him that same question. He created
the common declaring 3220 words as the length.

upon pressing the beginning block letter of the common,
he got the usual choices (ie. data, next, etc.), pressed
-DATA- . At the top of the page was:
        "lessname" "comoname" (no length was shown)

(you will notice that when editting a short common,
ie. <967 words, you only see Common Editor)
only the first four options were presented to him.
he pressed "d" (zero the common), he got the normal
zeroing page, but only 322 words were presented to him
to zero, not the 966 he should have gotten.

He was editing a common that was not in ECS already,
and was too long to be reasonable brought in ECS just
to edit it (limit= 1000 words).  Thus the common editor
could only allow him to work on 322 words (one disk

the common editor in the reasonable future.

The condense error help page (for which thank you very

you to the "using" block and not to the "used" block

to take you to the "used" block?

  That would (I think...) be VERY difficult, since the
-use-d blocks are physically inserted into your lesson
binary.  This means that as far as anything working with
the binary (which I assume the condense help pages are)
is concerned, you actually had those blocks in your lesson.
No information is stored as to what sections were used,
where they were used from, etc.  The -use- commands them-

  Fritz is correct...it would be difficult. Right now,
the condense error package does not have enough information

must do the best it can.

   Phil Mast is on vacation. I would suggest bringing this
to his attention when he returns, and he _may_ be able to
provide some help for you, but don't be too surprised if
he says that this would lengthen plato code too much for
results gained. After all, you should be able to
locate the error by condensing the used unit itself.
Perhaps you might have to bring it into lesson to fixup

seems as sup, sub etc should be attached onto

same for shifted sup and sub.

the main problem is that you cannot see a

I found a spelling error ..."pronuncation" ... I think it
is in section II. Also check the grammar in the first
sentence in section V. Errors sometimes appear in
PLATO lessons because of typing errors, and not because
the author did not know how to spell the word. That is un-
doubtedly the explanation for the error noted above. It's
important to proof read for errors, but don't assume that
a single reason can account for all of them.
I must admit, I enjoyed your spelling test, but made some

Spelling errors sometimes also occur because transmission

A feature such as TERM calc should be as unobtrusive as
possible: it erases two lines at the bottom of the screen.
As a result, I try to keep my displays away from those
lines, but I would rather not have to concern myself
with more than two lines.

  Consider: The jumpout message is plotted 3 lines up
at present. This suggestion would not cause any more of
the screen to be destroyed by system orginated text than
at present.
  If, however, this were still considered a problem, a
check could be made in the TUTOR code of term calc to put
the arrow up one line from regular if it were called from
lessons only authors can access (ie: the lessons connected
to the editor) OR a term calc could be put in the editor
itself for use on the list page. (where it is usually
needed in this capacity)
  Another approach to solve the octal constant space sqeeze
would be to allow one to say :
 -6 a?07777 3430 3777 0000 0000
For several variables (maybe va-vz and na-nz could be the
convention). If the student bank is saved for term calc,
this would be very easy to do.

        Bowery: the "now preparing" message is logically
inhibited via "inhibit erase". It seems that people who
were worried about losing information in a jumpout were
safe, because they already used inhibit to prevent the
automatic screen erasure of a jumpout.

        It would be a nice feature to be able to keep
students from using term -calc-. The present structure
of putting a dummy -term- in the lesson is rather a kluge...

  My argument for variables in term calc as a solution to
this problem still stands and would be appreciated by many
people who do not use octal constants.
  It would be a 15 minute change: a specs okassign and
a bunch of defines in the student set. As I understand it,
the present structure of term calc routes students to a
different arrow anyway, thus their routine would remain
the same.

a help type unit or any type unit which performs _all_ of
the functions of the term calc presently on the system.

While not voting for or against the idea of inhibiting
term-calc for students, I pass that along as a reasonable
suggestion for those of you who might be adversely
affected by the deletion of such a feature.

Conversely, those of you who would like to see it inhibited
for student users need only install a term - calc in
your lesson. This will override the system term-calc and
can be programmed to let the student calc when you want him
to, and not when you don't want him to.

I was wondering.....
I've heard that there are 2 more PLATO systems set up
in the US (or 1 up and 1 going op in Florida).

What would the feasability be of running some type of
line from the one north of CERL to CERL (U of IL) and
down to Florida? This way (or so it seems, to my limited
knowledge of computers) that you could tie all 3 systems
together, share similar lessons (after all’, how many
different versions of Spanish 100 are there?), thus
increasing present lesson space by getting rid of duplicate
lessons.

Some may argue that the cost for the line (especially if
it is a phone line) would halt the project, but how much
more does it cost for disk drives? Also, man hours of
programming would be saved as duplicate lessons wouldn't
be programmed.

There is now a phoneline connecting the U of Ill. PLATO

It seems that since both PLATO and CDC would
profit by having more space’ etc’ and that
they are both educational organizations, that
there shouldn't be any need for royalties. If
nothing else, how about an agreement where lessons
would be shared on a one-for-one basis, lessons
offered for sharing left up to the 2 organizations
to decide for themselves which ones they want to
offer, and negotiate from there?
Frankly, all this business of royalties seems to
me to be rather foolish--is PLATO and CDC set up
to help educate its users or to make a profit
for the organization to which it belongs.
If it is for profit, will Magnavox make their

Complete interconnectivity can be provided with reduncancy
with only two phone lines per site. The ARPA Network
interconnects its Interface Message Processors (just got a
mysterious period after Processors) with two and sometimes
three phone lines. Average transit time between two 'IMPS'
is generally less than 1/2 second per messages when the
IMPS are separated from each other by many other IMPS. This
form of interconnectivity permits optimum usage of the
phone lines (by allowing you to select the correct bandwidth
between a given pair of IMPS). The technology is definitely
available (I believe PLATO HAS an ARPA contract), although
I submit that the differing motivations of various PLATO
sites may make such technological realities impossible.

Your request is interesting. We have all wished that we

the computer has just thrown away a pile of output when you

   One of the recorded "off" message tapes is basically
useless--the error rate is so high that the error light
is on nearly continuously (only very rarely does a
small section of a line get output in scrambled fashion).
The fact that most of the tapes are imperfect at best
is really of little import as long as the line giving
the estimated off time can be read once in a while;
the bad tape played tonight was especially unfortunate
since the estimated off time had already been exceeded
by an hour at the time it was on. The "15 minute" tape
that was put on after it worked well enough to be able
to get the necessary info from it.
   I think I'd suggest that the "basic off number"
(_2_ hours, _30_ minutes, whatever) be distributed more
liberally on the displays--at the four corners like
a dollar bill perhaps--to optimize the possibility of
this BASIC info getting through.

     Right. The  culprit tape was the "1 hour" tape. After

to call CERL. I was told that they use a repeating loop
cassette. Most of these on the market are made of
notoriously poor quality tape. Might it be possible to
use normal, good quality tape and a reversing player?
They arent all that expensive.
     By the way, there is a particular message that
we have never seen. It shows up as sort of an arc of
random characters. Any clues? The tapes presently used
are pretty useless at this remote site, and Mr. Blomme's

As has been reported repeatedly, the problem is not with
the tapes (or not mostly with the tapes) those same tapes
read by the same tape player will run a single terminal
essentially without error. Something goes wrong when we
send the message out to the whole system.

Also there is a general misunderstanding of the time given.
It doesn't mean we will come up in say one hour from the
time of the crash. Rather it says that our best estimate
is that we will be down for an hour from the moment you see
the message. That statement can continue to be true for
several hours. If our best estimate changes, we usually
change the tape accordingly.

  The save buffer is saved between the first and second

I would like to see the same feature. We changed some

knowing what comes next. Found too many students

If an author makes the unforgivable error of typing in
many common chemically correct formulas as a tag to
an -answer- command, the new error analysis flags it
as a missing unit. This is indeed very perceptive
since a unit of -puts- is indeed required to transform
such answers to a form acceptable to PLATO.

Why can't you just say:

"I've noticed characters plotting at unusual positions when
in "term talk." Is this a common problem, and is the source
known? I find it rather annoying."

Of course, I realize how important this must be to you;
obviously, if you only use "term talk" you don't need to
worry about new disk space, or a better data-keeping or
answer judging system.

By the way, could the COPY key be activated at the TERM
arrow? Sometimes I misspell "talk" or "calc" and it sure
would be nice to correct it with the copy key when I press
term again. Also, what are the names of some good games?

Ok, here we go:

        1)During non-prime time, the NEXT key is often

          the occurances.

          erases have been periodically failing. This
          phenomenon acts like an inhibit erase that
          shouldn't have been there, but it never is.
          It has happened in lesson "news", in the

          just about everywhere else. It's hit at
          virtually all sites and times of year too.

        3)The period (.) keeps appearing in place of
          a space and dollar sign in some instances.

  key, however, shortly after the new framatter came
  in (which may be pure coincidence) the EDIT1 key
  would sometimes be processed as an EDIT key if the

  happen to me once every four or five lines when I
  was doing two articles a day in lesson "news".

Thanks for the detailed description, Bruce. It helps to

I've set up tests and demonstrated some of the problems to

The source of the $ to . (and space to .) mystical

it; other days, we run tests and it only happens once

In regard to marty's first note:

This is definitely a line error problem. Keep in mind

line errors would not then be that apparent to you.

are a lot of times that I leave errors in on purpose. For
instance, I may have a selection page of 10 items. As I'm
writing units one thru ten, I'll condense to see if it looks
ok. Plato will say, units so and so cant be found. I
_know_ they cant be found because I haven't written them yet
but I still want to see the ones I _have_ written. The way
 it is now, I have to write the complete lesson so it will

some (SHIFT-NEXT, DATA, HELP), but not others (e.g.

what the majority of authors seek in the way of error

seems to be that (1) most authors with errors DONT want
to work thru the lesson, (2) HELP is just a keypress away,

One of the assumptions IS wrong. Although it may seem

On the whole, the new error page is magnificent and very
useful, and will be even more useful when the DATA routines
are completed, giving , I presume, "aids-type" information
right there on the page.
   One suggestion: since missing units seem to be pretty
frequent "errors", as authors write their lessons giving
routing directions, and condense before those other units
are written, couldn't missing units be handled differently:
perhaps with a "*warning* you have units missing" message,
which could be bypassed directly, without going to the
errors page ? A different key could take you to the errors
page, if you were surprised that units were missing, and
wanted to know more....

That's no real problem, Silas.
I've come up with a define to do the job.

I simply set a flag in my router common, so that when
I want to recondense it, it routes the students to a
unit that tells them that the router is off. You could
just as easily do a jumpout q at that point, and get
rid of them when they press DATA from route resignon page.

Also keep in mind that a student on the route resignon

Chasing down errors hasn't been as convenient since the
very early days of PLATO IV, when one's whole lesson was
loaded into ecs for editing, and when an execution error
occurred, one was dropped right to the spot in the lesson
where the error occurred. And there were lots of execution
errors in those days.

Jim...

Shouldn't it be NEXT (or NEXT1) _preceded_ by a number rather
than _followed_ by a number? It seems to me that if you press
NEXT, then ZAP! you're going through your lesson, ignoring
the errors. What difference will it make if you press a
number key after you've already started??
ps: the new version of condense errors, even though exper-
imental, is really nice.

The Elementary Mathematics Curriculum Group has written
many lessons whose goal is to teach young students how to
think through the mechanics of finding the solutions to
arithmetic problems. If a student is able to find
solutions by pressing a few buttons at an adjacent terminal,
this goal is frustrated.

The terminals in the undergrad library are no longer in the
undergrad library. They have been loaned to various other
plato projects (and uni high) until they are needed again.

I still think, mike , that sites should not have to deal
with a clock-page term-calc. Then again, i can see that
some sites might desire it. It would be nice if term-calc
could be allowed or disallowed via site directors options,
but i suspect that woulden't be as easy as it sounds. I
woulden't consider it very important either, as one can
always get to term-calc by signing on.

        Would you teach a child to talk by forbidding her
to hear speech?
        Thousands of people who can neither do arithmetic
nor grasp number concepts could have learned the latter,
and probably the former, had they ever realized, from
experience, that arithmetic _works_ - that is, that an
operation gives the same result on repetition.
        The only practical way to guarantee such experience
is by making calculators available to kids.
        By the way - there are several branches of 'higher
math' that can be mastered by children too young to learn
arithmetic.

response 4 leaves me both happy and dismayed. I am
glad because I've always wondered why notes has proven
to be such a good forum for ideas on programming, yet has
never been used and rarely tried as a forum for educational
ideas. After all, PLATO is an educational system, and
hopefully its users are both programmers AND educators.

I am dismayed, however, by the content of the note.
The first line is an arguement by analogy which is
a falacious form of logic and therefor does not
necessarily lead to true conclusions even given
true premisses. I.e. to compare learning reading
to learning arithmetic is pretty dumb. Furthermore,
what has the fact that children can learn some 'higher
math' before arithmetic got to do with the issue of
the harm of having a calculator around when you are
trying to teach arithmetic? (continued)

---------- response 6
  07/26     22.20     alessi       edpsy

Lastly, on what evidence do you base the assertion that
the only way we will get kids to learn arithmetic and
the meaning of numbers (or whatever) is to give them
access to calculators? What evidence is there that, as
you say, the many people who have not learned these
things could have had they had calculators around?
References please, though I suspect your only reference
is yourself, or John Holt or some other hip radical
educator.

   I am looking for a name for a new command which would
initialize array data. For obvious reasons, "data" is
unsuitable, and "input" and "enter" sound too much as
though data is coming from the keyboard.

   set A?1,2,3.14,-1,v1+3,....etc

would set first element of array A(1,1)?1, A(1,2)?2, etc.

   set A(2,3)?5,4,3.... would start at A(2,3) and go on,
   set  v10?one,two,3.14, ... should also be feasible.

I had thought of using "fill" but someone else wants that
name. Thus "set" or "let" or "initial" are best alterna-
tives I can come up with. Surely someone out there ought
to be able to think of better name. Cast votes for these
names or suggest new ones via responses or pnotes. Winner
gets proud satisfaction of naming a Tutor command, plus

"Initial" is already the name of a different command;
too bad, I think it's the best choice....Unless maybe,
the new function could be something like:
initial array,A?1,2,3,4,5 $$ but see below about "array"
or
initial value,A?1,2,3,4,5 $$ another possibility
to match the present
initial common,....
and
initial lesson,....
I'm not sure that's a very satisfactory result, though.?
Of the several names proposed, I don't like the ones that
use (or abbreviate) the word "array", since this could also
be used for other purposes (as in Don's example using
a v-variable instead of an array name). So the best
name I have seen is -set-.
Or maybe, -initv- for initial-value.?
Don, would this command load the variables when encountered
in execution, or at some other time (e.g., beginning of
lesson execution)?

The simplest proposal from the user's point of view would
be to make the desired tags legal for -calc-. Offhand,
the only difficulty I see is that the ambiguity of
-calc A?3- would need to be resolved...presumably in
the direction of requiring -calc A(1)?3- to be written
when that is meant. If there is a
compelling reason why -calc- is unsuitable, the next
best choice, I think, is -set-. I am not persuaded
that there is any virtue in incorporating some abbreviation
of "array" into the command; the other "normal" commands
that can be used with arrays are not specially marked
when so used.

   Data would be dumped into destination when command
encountered. To act like load-time initialize, put
command into the ieu.

   Each item in list is intended to be a single variable
or constant...it can of course be an array element...but
would not be (at this time) a whole array. I would welcome
the challenge, but would not be able to fit all that into

I was instructed to put this back capability in my lessons,
you can try it for yourself in "cha67".  I cannot give
you any information based on student use, but i  suspect
that is a little used feature as it is not well advertised.
  My coding is not very sophisticated, to keep the
programming time within the 1 month limit.
For a nearly linear lesson the technique
unit to, unit t1, back to, unit t2, back t1....works.
Except that back breaks through my pauses...and then often
goes back further than one expects, soon you may get lost!
   My real criticism of this approach is that if the student
does come to use the feature and it works reliably, he will
back up say 5 frames, and when done studying that frame he
will want to jump (is this going backwards or forwards now?)
to where he started going backwards (to skip info he knows)
(cont.)

  07/28     10.17     bruce iehl       mtc

Well all this starts to get complicated and some things
limiting it's usefulness now are:
1) does the students own mental history of where he is at
 start to break down?
2) what other useful features cannot be used: rewriting
  over a part of the screen will make the feature not
  perform "naturally" to the student; what happens in a
  help sequence...
3) will the feature encourage students to skip info until
  they get to a question, then back up to the info, thus
  studying the lesson backwards? Does this tend to hide
  poorly written text? Does data on time in a section start
  to lose meaning?
4) can someone find a better way to help the student get
  where he wants to go?

well.... this is an old discussion probably not too many
people will still be reading but for what it's worth, bruce-

in many health science lessons (i dunno about elementary
school etc) it is helpful to give students as much control
as possible over their routing... to do this, backs
in every main unit are desirable and a universal key
throughout the lesson series leads to the index... typically
this is back1.  then, everything is indexed in chunks
of reasonable size and usually it is possible to find ones
way around with little hassele.

it's always nice to get a rise out of the game jocks
though-- gets them to think a little about education!

Aids people: I just spent a rather large amount of time
debugging a program that had an error due to the fact that
conditional commands must convert from floating to integer
AND when that conversion is done if the floating number
is too large to fit in 60 bits it turns out garbage.
  ie:
calc   v1?10ˆ1ˆ8
writec v1,10ˆ1ˆ8 negative?,expected
*this writes "10ˆ1ˆ8 negative?"

  This is because the argument in v1 (10ˆ1ˆ8) is too large
to fit into a 60 bit integer. When converted the exponent
shifts the mantissa of the floating point number beyond
the word boundry and puts a bit on in the sign position.
Please document this fact in the write up on floating point
and integer numbers.

The records cannot be too accurate (to take away from the

this terminal has recorded over 7 hours signed on the

in that period at approximately 100 per minute off and on.

kidding aside, most CAI systems are evaluated first
in terms of user hours... but it is important to remember
that they charge by the hour.
*
charging by a large bunch of time (like a year) is
a marvelous PLATO feature which prevents the student
from being burdened with anxiety-producing cost
consideration and time pressure.
*
on the other hand:

on a system like PLATO it is possible to leave terminals
signed on and go away... unthinkable on a system which
charges $10 or so per connect hour (like the new
health science network based at ohio state and mass
general hospital).

the advent of PLATO clearly makes it necessary to
develop a new way of measuring the rate of use...

To answer some questions:

1) By current data, about 15: of total use is in
"recreational" lessons--mostly at night.

2) This is probably a clear record for CAI systems--but
that isn't saying much. PLATO III with 20 terminals was
able to keep up with another CAI system with over 100
advertised terminals. I don't really know about other
large timeshare systems (e.g. the Princeton system) that
have been around for a long time. Very few other systems
make any effort to support more than 100-200 terminals.

3) Most timeshare costs are really of the annual type rather
than hourly--hourly charges are usually inflated to reflect
this fact of life. To estimate true costs per hour you
always need to know the number of hours per year per user.

4) Unfortunately we indeed can't tell if a connected
terminal is a functioning terminal-(95: are though).

At present, each terminal pays a pro-rata portion of the
operating and maintenance costs of the entire system plus
its own maintenance (based in part on travel distance for
maintenance people). All agreements with users contain
a section indicating that the person paying realizes that
a developing system will be subject to a degree of
unreliability. Unfortunately, few of the people who sign
these things pass the word on to the people who actually
have to put up with the unreliability. We are very

        I would like to correct a few minor misconceptions
which may have been engendered by Dr. Hody's response (¬$9)
to this note.
        The Health Education Computing Network (note: NOT
the health science network) charges $8 per connect hour for
access to Mass. General Hospital (MGH) and $10.15 per connect
hour to Ohio State University (OSU). This charge INCLUDES
communication costs from any place in the continental U.S.A.
Virtually ANY model of terminal may access both systems.

          There is also a 'time-out' feature (approx. 4 mins.)
thus minimizing expenses associated with abandoned ter-
minals.

        To alleviate the impression that use of the Health
Education Computing Network is prohibitively expensive,
there are currently 49 major health professions institutions

all equally FOR medical CAI and there is room for 2 systems!
so- thanks kathy for the correction! some more details:
*
the terminals which can be used must be ASCII type, 300
baud maximum and graphics are not currently supported.
i was not aware of the 4 minute automatic sign out
feature in the absence of activity--great!
*
a further clarification: the " distance independent" cost
only applies to those who are within a local call from
a Tymshare node-- others pay long distance rates to
the nearest node (which in many cases isn't near at all)
*
finally, i do not think there is currently an authoring
capability on that system and that the number of "ports"
available for sign on is VERY limited. i would appreciate

This:

the purpose of the lesson. My lesson writes on the screen
according to the student's commands, and if he wishes to
use the fu

was gotten by reading the previous response, _S_aving it,
pressing BACK at the "This note will take XX words etc."
page, and then responding. Ie, if you come back into
NOTES from that page, the save buffer is messed up just
like it says it will be. How is re-entry from that page
different than entry from the NOTES directory page? If
you save the note, press NEXT to go the editor but return
directly to notes, your save buffer is unmolested. What
happens between that page and here that doesn't happen
between the editor and here?
(Later: it seems to be somewhat random. I just did the
exact same thing and got the same note but about 10 lines
of it and the header of the next note.)

   I entered help notes, typed 481 then NEXT, and arrived at
my note. Then pressed HELP to learn how to use the new
feature. After reading the 2 pages, I was back at note 481.
I typed SHIFT s, and got message about 29 words saved (
although it said I could only enter the editor ). Anyway,
I hit SHIFT-BACK twice to get to notes index, then B to
enter a general note. Then iso ( I think ) got the observed
result.

   I just tried again ( see later note, also labelled
save-note ), and got similar results. Of course, this time
I didn't read the help pages. Also, I needed BACKs in 2
places which I had forgotten. ie, to get off the page which
says 'note saved, 29 words' or some such. Also, needed a
BACK to get out of insert mode ( before typing iso ).
   Am I just doing something dumb?

My two notes here are response number 7 to note number 359
and response number 5 of note number 386.

How they got in the save buffer is strange indeed. Is it
possible that they were stored away 'close' together by some
weird measure as they were written 'close' in time?

Could a system programmer respond, please??
When a student gets out of the condense queue by waiting
a while and pressing stop1, he is sent back to his
router with errtype=5. To what unit is he sent?
It seems reasonable to assume that he is sent to the
-route error- unit, but I have a hint from the behavior
of my router that he is sent to the -route end lesson-
unit. Can anyone verify and/or explain? Aids, as far

Keysets with serial numbers greater than 906 are now in
use at some sites. These were manufactured by a new
source (the old one went bankrupt) and were accepted
based on a brief user survey conducted several weeks ago.
They have touch characteristics which differ from that of
earlier keysets and seem to also have a tendency to
produce duplicate inputs ("key bounces"), It appears that
we will have to live with the different touch characteristic
but we do need to identify and repair those keysets which
are causing extraneous inputs. Your aid in identifying
and reporting (via "repair") keysets with these problems
will be appreciated.

We thank the users who took time to provide the feedback
which identified this problem.

The problems with the notes save buffer have been caused
by the fact that the same buffer is used for different
things when you are reading notes, and the case where
a person presses BACK after saving a note was not handled
correctly.  It has been fixed now to work MOST of the
time... and when it doesn't work it will do nothing more
harmful than not saving your lines.  Sorry for the confusion

        If there isn't to date such a method to do this

It appears that the -compute- command will not accept
the new array definitions for a pointer variable.
Example:
define   test
         array,string(5)=n1
         array,char(5)=n6
         array,point(5)=n11
         result=n20

.
.
code
.
.
compute result,string(i),char(i),point(i)

The above results in a condense error saying that point(i)
is unintelligible.
However,if point is defined as: point(i)=n(10+i)
the compute statement is accepted.

---------- response 2
  07/30     14.33     shirer       s

Because of space considerations, I am wondering if we
need to let -compute- use arrays at all, since they are
primarily for the author's use. The problem with
students using them is that we cannot redefine arrays at
execution time to cover the entire lesson, so if they
used the wrong array or array size they would get
multipludinous execution errors. Unless I get massive
demand for this. and am able to provide reasonable service
mitout lots of xerrs I will probably remove all array
stuff from execution time routines (where it is just sitting
around waiting at present) thos saving mucho core space for
other wondrous functions.
For now, no -arrays- in compute (as lesson -array- says).

Am I to understand by "all since midnight" that priority
is neutralized at midnight each day? Can you give some
idea of how much condensing will affect priority?
Also do you mean the amount of time spent actually doing
the condense or time in a lesson? Better yet, what is the
algorithm?
---------- response 3

   Why? Do you want to beat it?  Good.  Here's how:

Midden gave you straight dope...position in condense queue
depends on how much condensing you have been doing during
last "averaging period" which extends to several hours in
the past.

You can improve your lot by partialling-out long lessons
and only testing one unit at a time, since it is the total
condense time that counts, not number of condenses.
Fewer condenses means less load on system, more thinking
on your part (assumption), and you are rewarded with
faster condense service.

     I have heard that students have priority over
     authors in condensing.  If this is true would it
     be possible to modify this method so that after
     the author is waiting to condense after a set
     length of time (say 2 or 3 minutes) he has
     priority over students beginning to condense
     after that time period?  This would just move
     his position in the queue up as the ones ahead
     of him condense and not be waiting to condense
     for is minutes while incoming students get ahead
     of him in the queue.  This isn't a problem yet,
     but how about when school starts again and there
     are over 350 terminals in use at once?

  The original delphi programs, described in Umpleby's
masters thesis, were never transfered from PLATO III to
PLATO IV. Work since the summer of 1972 has concentrated
on related areas, namely, conputer-based conferencing,
social indicators from cybernetics, use of interpretive
structural modeling--specifically interaction matrices
and some simulations. Some lesson names are respectively
discuss,htq,interact,pollute. Since I am concentrating
on reporting on past work this summer, program maintance
in not up to date, so use at your own risk. A set of
considerably more complex programs along these lines
has also been created, contact me if you are interested
in a demo.

In case anyone is interested, Stu Umpleby will be in town
for one day Friday.

you if they still are in the course (or what became of them)
and also when the last time they signed on was. They can
also check the number of notes that person has. You'll
still have to form your own hypothesis on whether or not
they actually read the note. You'll have some data to make

On this, the 31st day of July, Year of Our Lord 1975,
CERL 257 did witness the demise of its last good kkeysett.

It is noted in passing that said kkeysett served long
and well, and against incredible odds did manage to
stay through the last batch of terminal transferrals.
It also served anonymously (having no serial number)
shunning recognition and preferring quiet, loyal service.

On behalf of the many authors who were aquainted with
the beloved kkeysett, I express deep sorrow and regret
at its passing.

I hereby propose, before God and everybody, that henceforth,
in honor of said kkeysett, all "keysets" be either
referred to as "keyset" (the quotes denoting a questionable
use of the word) or kkeysett, which is infinitely more
descriptive.

In all honesty, though, folks, this second batch of new

In a day of editing on one of the sets from the second
batch, I have the following to say:

1) There is noticeably less "slop" in the second batch,
   although still somewhat more loose than the older
   sets.
2) I haven't noticed the tendency (which was quite
   pronounced in the first shipment) to produce
   double key presses.

        regarding the changes to the handling of the
        font code, Dr. Cheng had a linguistics lesson
        containing code to the following effect:

        arrow
        force font
        match n1,(SF)a(SF),(SF)b(SF),(SF)c(SF),d,e,f
        show n1

        the student could type in a,b and c, and n1
        would have the values 0,1,2 (the system adding
        the font automatically).  Typing d,e,f would
        give the values 3,4,5 (evidently the font was
        not(?) added when there was none required in
        the match itself?)  In any event, the match
        no longer works - the student now must press
        shift font for the NON shift-fonted cases (d,e,f).
        As the lesson has not been touched in 3 months,
        has there been a change in the way such cases are

there must be more to the story than this...was there

there is no magical way a force font can be added to "a"
"b" "c" without being added to "d" "e" "f"...unless there
is some "funny" micro in action...also not understandable,
what is adding the extra "font" after the "a","b","c" to
the student's response?
yes...there have been changes in the handling of fonts...
see new system features notes...but, I have checked very
carefully...and have yet to see a case in which the change
(which should help the foreign language programming

  The IS option (in pnotes, anyway) still is not totally
correct. If you Save the contents of a note you are
writing, delete them, press BACK1 to forget it and return
to reading your notes, hit DATA1 to send a note to the
author of the note you are reading, and IS the previously
saved stuff into the new note, you find your save buffer
has gotten zeroed somewhere along the line and all that
gets IS'd is the line with the name/signon/date/time/etc.
However, if you press LAB when reading the note and IS
then, you get bits and pieces of other people's notes.
if you then try to delete this stuff, you are very likely
to get our favorite exec error... unit destroy, 3rd command,

The tape recorder is a studio (or broadcast) quality
professional job using cartridges which run at 7 1/2
inches per second. The improvement may be the result
of any or all of the following:

1) wider tape (more "bandwidth" for information, inter-
   active with speed)
2) faster tape speed (I understand the modified cassette
   recorder previously used ran only slightly faster than
   the standard 1 7/8 inches per second.)

For standard lessons to be used by large numbers of students

are no definite plans to reduce the 10 TIPS cpulim, but that
has been considered from time to time and could happen.

Just for the record, this will be a WONDERFUL feature and
will allow (the once highly touted) ability to build
HUGE vocabularies for use in a number of lessons (without
compromising the ability to -use- source code).

the technique would use the -use- command machinery but
would be quite a bit more sophisticated...for it would
carry along a sub-binary of the vocabulary along with
the vocabulary source...

if this subject has been hashed out before, y'all will have
to excuse a newcomer...how much trouble would it be to alter
the program for the print options?...when there are multi-
ple authors of a lesson (sometimes in different geographical
locations in the case of course med), we often unintention-
ally make duplicate requests when only 1 is needed
...we also find it difficult to manage printing and re-ini-
tialization of data files since = all four time zones
are involved...if plato responded to a print status request
by indicating date and time of last print and name of last
requester, the following advantages might be realized
1. fewer prints for plato to run
2. easier management for some datafiles
3. additional check for stolen security codes

As mentioned in a HELP note from July, the PLATO Elementary
Reading Curriculum Project (PERC) has been trying to develop
a more useful and reliable system for creating and
reproducing audio disks. With help from Leo Streff of the
CERL hardware staff, and with help from the manufacturers
of the commercial version of the random access audio
device, that development is now nearly complete. The
results are quite promising.

It is now possible to sit in a studio equipped only with a
microphone and a four-button console and make a master

---------- response 1
  08/01     13.13     john r       reading

random access audio disk. Using an audio delay line and
some vox circuitry, the system senses the onset and
termination of a message, and stores its parameters in a
system file. Messages can be re-recorded and edited as
necessary, and the system allows both the duplication of
disks from the master disk and the program-controlled
formatting of the message parameters into TUTOR source
code.

It appears that the entire system is exportable to remote
sites. In addition, CERL maintains an audio service
facility that can produce parameterized disks from a good
quality taped script sent here by the user (there is a
charge for this service).

Persons interested in a demonstration should contact me via
p-notes or telephone (217 333-7409). Hard-copy documentation
of the system will be available in a couple of months.

it seems that if you are at gross grid 148 and move the
cursor up one dot in fine grid, then press "g", it subtracts
one line from the gross position, giving 48. this will
apparently work for any position on the screen. upon
testing the code, PLATO assumes 3248 for 48.

I have just noticed a "new system feature" which may be a
side-effect of the recent changes to *answer*: A list
command which contains a period (.) now causes a condense
error. This made it impossible for students to work thru
lessons which had been working (and unchanged) for quite
some time.?
Maybe the accounting lessons are the only ones which use
list commands to accept abbreviations (so that a programmer
sometimes automatically types in the period following an
abbreviation), but other authors might have done the same
thing.

I agree that the list command now gives condense errors
on lists that use to work fine. In our case
the list contained a chemical formula written in
standard notation, which, of course, is not acceptable to
TUTOR. The change seems to be that now the lessons
fail to work while before the characters which TUTOR
didn't like were just ignored and the lesson ran fine.

In putting phrases into the answer/wrong/list/match
commands...these commands had to be completely re-written.
In doing so...I tried to give a few errors to the author
to warn him of things that he meant one way but that TUTOR
doesn't interpret the same way (yet). The period is one of
these...until recent changes, the author could put something
like "etc." in his list command...but, once condensed, this
was handled only as "etc"...so, I felt it better to pull
back and make a better correspondence to what is really
going on. This needs to be done eventually...when we
attempt to handle punctuation in the answer commands.

So...I can easily allow periods in -list- commands...but
it would be to everyone's benefit if the lessons can be
changed at this time.

I am open to your suggestions...but make them quickly...I
am leaving for Alaska soon!

on their lessons from students or reviewers to -use- the

code in lesson "cmode" (no inspect or use code). This

lesson lets the student enter one-line on-the-page comments

which are saved in storage and sent to a dataset. "cmode"

also contains code for reading the comments. Instructions

for use are included. This "comment mode" operation has

  08/05     10.17     golden       s

For those who like to keep up on the basic design of the
PLATO system, two important changes have occurred:

1) Output from the computer used to flow from ECS to CM to
   a PPU to the NIU. A couple of months ago, Dave Andersen
   changed things so the same PPU which handles input of
   keys also handles output directly from ECS. CM and the
   CPU are not involved in getting output to the NIU. Thus
   he saved one PPU, some CM and some CPU time.

2) Disk reading and writing used to happen via a special
   device called the side door adapter which provided a
   path directly between the disk controller and ECS. CM
   and the CPUs were not involved. Now, Don Lee uses two
   PPUs to send data to and from ECS. CM and the CPUs are
   still not involved. Maximum transfer rate has been
   maintained.

        Ahh... the "advantages" of this change are not as
clear as with the former. It is fervently hoped by the
folks upstairs, that eventually another mainframe will
be connected to PLATO. If it is to communicate with the
other system and operate in symbiosis with it, an ECS
"port" is required. Since all 4 available ports are
presently in use, 1 of them had to go. The 1 to "go" was
the side door adapter, since the 2 used for I/O, and the
one necessarily left open for research purposes (AMS and
other forms of giant mass storage) had to stay. So, when
the job was determined to be accomplishable with the use of
2 PPUs, the adapter went. Hokay?

There has been a PLATO system based at CDC in Minneapolis
for more than a year and a small system at Florida State
University for about 8 months. (I mention this because there
have been several notes which hint at the coming of such
systems.)

Our change in disk reading techniques saves an ECS port and
eliminates a piece of equipment as explained in previous
responses. It also makes our disk system more closely
resemble standard CDC systems. But ours transfers informa-
tion twice as fast as theirs. There is just a chance that
they will now adopt our techniques. There was no chance for
that while we used the side door adapter.

Ho hum. You see, when PLATO "crashes" it doesnt have a
chance to tell anybody about it. A "crash" isnt something
that we plan; its something that happens all by itself,
due to some hardware or software problem. And when it
happens, we dont want to risk writing anything back to disk,
for fear that perhaps some of the stuff out there in memory
is messed up too.

     Perhaps some understanding can be had by examining
the word "crash". Think about it...would you deliberately
crash your car? (Ignore the insurance aspects..Lloyds
of London wouldn't insure Plato.) When the systems people
believe that Plato is unstable, they tell us so in no
uncertain terms. But, Plato in an immensely complex
set of electronic machinery and programs, and there is
not yet such a thing as a crash-proof system.
     So, please don't get upset at the systems staff when
Plato crashes, for from every crash, they learn how to make
Plato more stable for the future.

I think that it would be a big help if there were two

-branch- or -goto- or -jump- or -do- or whatever you want
based on the following logical expression:
        frac(number/2) = 0
That expression is true (has value -1) for even numbers.
It is false(0) for odd numbers. Remember to use a v-type
variable for number.

Just before the recent crash, (for about one hour before)

site arizona with LOST KEYS. This appears to be a repeat
of the problem Rick Blomme _et al._ discussed in an old
general note of July 18. It does appear to be worst at
an arrow after a few seconds of doing nothing.

This problem has also been noticed at various times and
on various terminals here for the past week or two by
numerous people, although it did not occur very often.

Keys lost include both alphabetic and function keys.
Are others having this problem? Is this a problem that
systems know about? Out of curiousity, does it have

Well, if you check in aids under "read only", you will
find that it says that a read only common can not be
altered. Therefore you should not try to alter it. I may
be mistaken, since I have never worked with a read only
common, but perhaps you should try to load the common
from the author mode display page. I think that you hit
shift-c (hit shift-data to find out for sure). Then by
typing in the lesson and common names, you should be able
to edit the common. PLATO will not know that the common
is read only.

I see what you mean. I just tried to edit and the copies
remain. I am not sure exactly why the second copy is
retained but I do have an idea. if you first edit the
common in read only, the edited version is saved. Then,
if you remove the "read only" from te common command and
condense, the edited version gets transfered to what
was the read only. Now this isjust a guess, and systems
people could tell you for sure, but it looks like there
are two versions of one common. One is the editing version,
and the other is the version used by the students. The
link between them would be the common command which loads
the edited version (unless there is a read only). That
is why the changes do not get transfered. PLATO is told
_not_ to load from the edited version. Hope this answers
the question...

frequently "x" is used as a mnemonic to represent the

i also like the "trpose" also.

I am truly grateful to Rick and Don for the myriad of
system-defined symbols, parameters and functions that have
been added to PLATO in the last months. Such additions
have two profound effects:

1) Certain things that could not be done at all before, or
only with great difficulty, are relatively trivial now.

2) Programmers often ignore the fact that many of their
programs may make implicit assumptions about the machine
on which PLATO currently runs, e.g., blocksize=322 words or
that comp(x) = -x in most cases. Having the system define
such things may have an effect on the way some programs
are written since it focuses the programmer's attention on
these assumptions, and a judgement of whether a slight
design change might make it independent of some of them.

Is it safe to assume that the size of a TUTOR lesson
block will always equal *zdswpb*, or will dataset block
size possibly be independent of TUTOR lesson block size?

If the latter is true, then the creation of a system symbol
called *zwpb* would be useful to those of us who write
programs which make use of the common ¬D source conversion
feature for generating formatted TUTOR code.

The *z....etc* to which you refer is covered in a New
Systems note, right ? I mention this because I started to
write a note saying "wots all this ?", and then remembered
NSnotes at the last minute...others should look there too.

   I originally put in the parameter as "zwpb" and
then took it out; the use you mention is interesting
and might be cause for putting in BOTH symbols. The
block length for a dataset will likely be made a parameter
that can be specified at the time of creation of the
dataset (variable, but not on-line, run-time variable).
We will be working during the next few months to remove
all system dependencies on the exact size of a disk block.

Now ERASE is going whacky...

If you type in a long response (> about 100 characters) at
an arrow and try to erase them, you will find that the ERASE
key fails more than 75: of the time. The normal pattern is
for it to erase 2 characters, miss 7, erase 2, miss 7, etc.
It varies, however, sometimes erasing 3 or 4, or missing up
to 15 or so.

Has this been this way for long?

Folks, he is absolutely right! It happened to me too, and

the intuitive impression one would recieve more likely,
is that the ERASE key would take as much time as typing
a regular key at an arrow, which does NOT autobreak.

Beware, hopeful job seekers" Many of these "jobs" you see
advertised are merely part of a ritual required to satisfy
the government's "Equal" Employment Opportunities programs.
In many cases, the job is going (almost) automatically to
a person who has the job currently; the law merely says
they have to advertise the position and go thru the motions.

Universities (especially the U of I, U-C) are notorious for
this type of behavior. No aspersions on U of D; just an
experienced observation.

If you can determine what the current job holder is doing
(if there is/was one) this is your best indication of
whether or not it is all a sham. Beware of positions for
which the current employee is re-applying!

If you are asking why the parentheses around the word Equal,
that is because in many cases the program means equality in
a very nominal sense only.

If you want to know what the EEO is in general, it is a
program enforced (more or less) by the government to insure
that employers (in this case, agencies who receive part or
all of their funding from the government) do not
discriminate in hiring on the basis of race, creed, sex,
etc, etc.

The program _requires_ that every effort be made to advertise
available positions in a way which ensures that the avail-
ability will be known to all groups and individuals, NOT

---------- response 5

NOT just to "select groups" of the employer's choosing.
In other words, one cannot discriminate in the publicizing
of the job either.

Many, MANY agencies, schools, and other employers make one
year appointments for various positions. At the end of each
one year appointment they go through the _motions_ of
soliciting qualified people for the position (which looks
very good for their EEO program). But all the while they
may have every intention of hiring back the person who
had the appointment for the previous year. And why not?
They have invested a full year in his/her training, etc, and
he/she already (presumably) knows the job far better than
any outside person!

  08/08     12.17     fay       rtv362

However, this practice is extremely unfair to the
individuals who think they really have a chance at the job!
Granted, the employer might hire someone new IF she/he
meets and exceeds the qualifications of the "incumbent" by
a wide margin. But specific on-the-job experience cannot
be had by most applicants!

My recommendation is to ascertain what the status is of
the incumbent: are they leaving? moving out of town?
is it a completely new job? If the incumbent is one of the
candidates then the thing is a sham, practically speaking.

The most odious instance is where the employer consciously
intends to hire back the incumbent, but goes thru the
motions of publicizing and interviewing anyway, just to
satisfy Big Brother that they are Equal Opportunity
Employers!

When someone calls your home phone, and it rings and rings,
the assumption is a) you are not home, or b) you cannot
get to the phone at the moment.  There is no message to
the caller, and he knows to try later.

Similarly, when you are paged at your terminal you need
not make a response at all.  The page will not affect the
execution of your lesson material (or whatever) and the
caller will assume you would rather not be bothered at
the moment, or that you (shudder) have left your terminal
signed in but unattended.

You can jot down the name of your caller if you like (it
does appear as part of the page) and make it a point to

You can find out who is in the lesson by pressing DATA.

An author can include such an option if he is using a
common and if there is an -imain- unit. A conditional
do command in the imain unit can be used to cause a
two or three line message to be written at the bottom
of the screen in the rewrite mode at the beginning of
each unit the student enters. A special unit in the
lesson via -term- command will permit the author to
turn the message on or off or change the contents of
the message.
But again, how do you know whether you should condense

The names are a PLATO tradition. They were picked many
years ago when we first got disk equipment for PLATO III.
A whole alphabet of female names were picked for the active
disk-packs. Backups with male names (many of them Greek)
were also selected. We have kept the tradition until
recently. Active packs continue to have female names.
We have so many backups though, that we switched to very
unromantic names made up of the date and some other identi-
fiers.

to "deprive" you of using them in nice places). It
will take an overhaul (how major I have no idea) of

Hopefully they are not "useless" to everyone and some

A nice complement to the arsenal of answer and concept
judging available on PLATO would be a "writblok".
A "writblok" would be much like a common block, but would
contain nothing but tags for -writec- commands! It could be
referenced in other lessons (notice I did not say -used-)
just like common. And it would be very, very useful for
use with large vocabs and complex concept judging.

Currently, in order to free up source blocks, I am attempt-
ing to use storage and a dataset (block number selected
based on "anscnt"). This will allow me to make available to
the student a large "reference" library of short definitions
in all lessons.

We have a system which works quite nicely for question
text generation. Question texts are entered via a
dataset editor which looks almost identical to system source
editor. In addition, other pieces of information are also
entered such as the correct answer(s),and number of choices
(multiple choice type questions). This information
is separated by special delimiters and then a processor
is run which builds a directory giving the block ¬$, offset,
and length of a question text. Thus any question can be
referenced easily by refering to the directory (which is
built into the first block of dataset). Also, the correct
answer fields and ¬$of choices can be used for answer
judging.

that something like:

stoload nc320,1,200

cause an execution error. (And similarly for a -comload-
if one tries to -comload- into an area of central memory

As a (useful) compromise, perhaps a special value for
the system defined variable "error" could be set; this
would allow you to make a simple adjustment to your code
to catch "overwriting".
---------- response 3
  08/12     08.38     guerra       uimc

Well, the only problem with Fay's suggestion is that
you execute the stoload first and THEN find out if you
over-wrote part of your common. The idea of the execution
error is to stop the program BEFORE the over-writing occurs.
Issuing an error message AFTER my meticulously-gathered
database has been destroyed is roughly comparable to crying
over spilled milk.
   When I made my suggestion, I didn't realize that there
were some applications where one would WANT central memory
storage and common to overlap, basically because I had
never encountered any techniques where that would be
desirable. (In all my applications, it would be most
UNdesirable for that to happen.) However, far be it from
me to restrict anyone's freedom. Given the fact that there
are people who depend on it working that way, I guess
it should be left the way it is. (sniff)

The problem is not too deep but is quite pervasive. It is
a matter of how our limited central storage space is
allocated. Provision of more than 1500 words of temporary
common means that more than 1500 words of expensive central
storage space must be set aside for possible use by every
terminal using the system. It is far cheaper to have a lot
of disk space used. Al Avner

A driver for PLATO drills is now available for general

and development have gone into producing a drill paradigm
which is more powerful, more controlled, and more indiv-
idualized than the standard (setperm/randp) PLATO drill
(although it will not handle all situations).
The paradigm incorporates a corrective feedback and cri-
terion teaching model. The driver may be -use-d and is
described in lesson "cfp". An example of its use is in
lesson "feedback" (teaching Greek and Latin anatomical
root words).

We are interested in working with individuals or groups

     It's pretty good. I found that it did well at
teaching my type of recalcitrant person. Only one
problem I noted, and that was the use of the word
"lead". I, at first, took it for the element lead,
but you wanted the verb "to lead". Also, I noticed
that your top scorers all had scores over 1000, which
I started with. Does it add the scores of the different
parts? This wasn't made very clear.
     All in all, I think you'll have great success with
this project.

---------- response 2

The scoring formula used in the lesson is not part of the
driver but is defined by the instructor (inspect "feed-
back"). In this case the formula (for each drill session) is
a function of the ¬$ and type of mistakes. The highest score
is 1000/session. But the score accumulates over sessions.
(The average time/session is also kept and calculated in a
"combined" score.)

After each drill session the student may continue with the
next session, repeat his last session, or start over with
session 1. If he repeats a session, his score and average
time for that session is overwritten with his new score and
time. This reinforces the student to master already seen
words (i.e., getting a score of 1000 in fewer minutes). But
to get a really large score, the student must move on to
additional sessions (thus learning more words).

An excellent system. I even learned a little.

An real tutor would not need to be told to present the
next question; but in this system (and much of PLATO)
I have to hit NEXT after reading "ok". I see three
alternatives:
1) leave previous stimuli and responses on screen;
always present next stimulus after a correct response,
2) after a correct response, move the stimulus and the
response to another area of the screen (maybe just above,
to simulate moving down a page of paper) and present
next stimulus.
3) present the next stimulus after a short delay. This
is most like a real tutor, but would probably be confusing
in practice.

Thank you for your comment and suggestions. One possibil-

key simply bring in the next item IF the answer to the prev-
ious item were correct. That is, instead of 2 key presses
(one for the judgment and one for the next item), one key
press would judge "ok", do a full screen erase, and
display the next item. Of course, if the item were in-
correct then 2 key presses would still be necessary.

I first used this technique in a Plato III drill written
in CATO (before TUTOR was invented). It works well for
some students, distracts others. It is most useful late
in learning, when a large proportion of responses are
quick and correct. Providing the capability as an option
which the student can select at any time seems the best
use of it. Some students select it early and keep it
throughout; some quite late; a few don't like it at all.

The particular concern is with the proliferation of dataon

G-Note ¬$176 has a peculiar glitch...when the note plots
something is written at the top of the page over either the
person and course or the ¬$ of responses, I can't remember

     The glitch is mairson's cute attempt at putting
"*** tcourse response ***" at the top. This, of course,
is unreadable once someone responds to the note. See
the Sweater's reply to that note for additional info.

Curiosity killed PLATO?

How come "stop" works so well in the edit mode for both
common and dataset editors, but so miserably in the inspect
mode? I have to hit stop about 3 times or so before the
text display is stopped when in the inspect mode, but
usually once does the trick when in the edit mode.

---------- response 1
  08/13     14.02     frye       mathb

Because the edit-mode editor and the inspect-mode inspector
are two different routines. Guess which one doesn't have
the -stop- key programmed in?

Dave

---------- response 2
  08/13     14.03     dave fuller       uimc

        Well, there are several differences, but the one
that has probably killed the inspect mode program is that
it does a
pause  .75,keys=all
       Or some such, after every so many lines of screen
time. Since the program processes the .75 second pause
while the output is being generated, behind the program,
you do not notice it, but in times past you could press
STOP and the pause would catch the key consistently.
Nowadays, with the ever changing handling of output, timing
keys, and what have you, it doesn't work as well as it used
to. (program was written by M. Midden, I think)
        I have a sneaky suspicion that the common/dataset
editor packs up output in a string, with embedded carriage
returns, and does one -showa- for the page, and the reason
that STOP is so effective is because the output is
generated in one fell swoop, and STOP aborts the whole
schmeer...

     Hmm....I frequently use a statement such as:

Just wondering.....

Has -specs okspell- been changed recently?
It used to accept some pretty outrageous misspellings
(e.g. 'hemrgc' for 'hemorrhagic'), but seems
much stricter now. This is good--previously it couldn't
distinguish 'intratracheal' from 'intralingual'. Has
anyone else noticed a difference?

---------- response 1

some other things associated with the answer commands work
very much better.

---------- response 2
  08/13     11.12     golden       s

The spelling routine used in -answer- and -match- commands
was a temporary essay into this field meant to soon be
replaced by a much better system. It took several years,
but the replacement has now occurred. We will continue to
imporve the speller, but the basic structure will probably
stay.

I've asked this before, but the people who could answer
were reported out of town. So if Dave Andersen or Ruth
Chabay is back, would one of you try this, please??
When a student gets out of the condense queue by waiting
a while and pressing stop1, he is sent back to his
router with errtype=5. To what unit is he sent?
It seems reasonable to assume that he is sent to the
-route error- unit, but I have a hint from the behavior
of my router that he is sent to the -route end lesson-
unit. Can anyone verify and/or explain? Aids, as far
as I can see, does not mention this, thereby implying
that the -route error- unit is entered.

---------- response 1
  08/13     14.36     andersen       s

-stop1- from the condense queue goes to the end-of-lesson
unit of the router... does seem rather strange and I
can't remember the reason why it was done this way...

Could be changed to go to the error unit if someone feels
very strongly about it.

¬6 Illinois grows corn! Also wheat.

Embedded commands also accept abbreviations...i.e single
letters, since there are only a few commands which can be
ebedded, anything beginning with "s" must be "size", no?

There are many more ordinary commands with approximately
the same spelling, so we must be much nastier about
insisting on exact spelling there.

Of course, you CAN use SD in inspect mode to see what

it does NOT go into ID mode, and does NOT show a cursor.

size's, etc.'s,....seems to me that 80: of the time
I'm not really satisfied with the display and end
up going back and changing it...and after all, it
wasn't that hard to do --back-- then r¬$ for replace

---------- note 338 questions
  08/13     20.40     telson       arizona

Two questions.......

1. What function does the Bulletin Board serve?
       It's almost five days after Saturday's
       ECS repair and that "important" announcment
       is still on the top half of the page.
       The New Features information is equally
       outdated. The Bulletin Board is
       a good idea, but not very effective if
       not updated. Perhaps it no longer is needed?

2. Why must you press NEXT after a "shifted lesson"
       (like N or B) is entered on the author mode page
       if you have previously typed something and erased
       it? Seems as if the -long 1- is wiped
       out the first time it is used. Try it;
     type something, erase it, and press "N"; nothing
     happens until you press NEXT.

stan t

---------- response 1
  08/13     21.46     blomme       s

  The bulletin board is not currently on-line updateable
nor have we made provision for a "BULLETIN, display to
appear when new items have been added (and not read)--
both have been intended for some time and it may be
quite some time still until they are implemented.
  Once a key has been typed (and recognized as a
non-shifted key option) the long is changed from 1 to
10 to permit completion of the typing of the lesson
name. If you erase, then with the long set at 10 your
"first" key input will no longer trigger judging.

I just noticed (I'm sure it's a recent change) that the
apostrophe (') is now handled as a delimiter by the
edit and copy keys, but NOT by the erase key; erase still
treats apostrophe as a part of the word it's embedded in.?
Any reason for this disparity? Will it be changed??
Personally, I like having apostrophe treated as a
punctuation mark, i.e., as a delimiter. Thanks to
whoever made the partial change. I'd like to see it
extended to include erase and erase1.

Sure would be nice, but hard for us do. We would
have to save, in the condensed lesson, pointers to disk
locations of all the units, since we don't know which
unit is going to have trouble. Maybe we could find room
for the block id of each unit, tho the -use- command would
cause some trouble in that regard.

about the same thing, and which could be readily used with

Another suggestion for alarm:

How about allowing the user to type in just the hour
if he wishes an alarm on the hour. The routine currently
accepts numbers without the colon, but one such as 9 is
interpreted as 00:09. A test for those under 24 (and
possibly requiring 00:xx for shortly after midnight) would
make the routine more convenient.
Also, how about allowing the user to type in p.m. if he
is more familiar with this notation, and have the routine
add 12:00?

I second the request for the availability for student
signons.

An approximation to "alarm" could be made, using
-term alarm- to set the clock, and an -imain- to
ring the alarm.

Of course, this wouldn't work for lessons where the student
sits in one unit for 20 minutes.

---------- response 3
  08/15     13.34     silver       ve

Hmm...that is a difficulty I hadn't thought of. Maybe
putting a show of the time of day in the imain would be
more appropriate, then.
Doesn't anyone want to expand the utilization of the
present "alarm"? We have people working in clinics, and
it is NOT a selling point to say that they get wrapped up
in a Plato program, and therefore neglect their duties!

---------- response 6
  08/15     15.05     s gooch       p

   An alternate suggestion has been made to me:

   What if alarm were made so that you could -jumpout- to
it, and’ after setting an alarm, a student could be jumpout
returned?  The alarm would then signal students in the
same way that it now signals authors.

   Of course the input formats could be polished up if
students were to use the lesson.

   Would this be a workable solution? Would it be a better
solution to jumpout to lesson alarm with the alarm time in
a variable, have alarm set the alarm, and then return?

   This could probably be accomplished easily.

---------- response 7
  08/15     15.05     warner       iu

The -timer- command would do the job if the students were
routed. It would send the students to the timer unit in
the router. From there, if no importat variables were
altered, the student could be popped right back to his
lesson using a jumpout return,return.

---------- response 8

Fine unless your router uses timer.

I like the idea of jumping out to alarm (but it's a sys

The number was changed, along with that of 15 or 20 other
cs courses, in order to put some systematic order into
the numbering of cs courses. From now on, with a few
exceptions (mainly courses cross listed with other
departments, whose numbers cannot be changed), courses
whose number has middle digit 5 will be numerical analysis
courses; middle digit i will signify application courses.
CAI will fall in the applications group.?
The same reasoning applies to CS 109, which is now 196;
middle digit 9 is being used for misc. courses such as
seminar, thesis, and honors courses.?
CS majors have been putting up with the gradual process of
making these changes for about a year now. Happily, the
process is almost complete. A cross list (old vs. new ¬$s)
was refused by the University for inclusion in the Time
Table, but one is available on the bulletin board near
my office door (128 DCL).

Is there any compelling reason that non-function keys cannot
be made into a JKEY?  I have a situation where it is
perfectly logical for certain non-function keys (notably
some of the punctuation marks) to initiate judging.  Map-
ping the desired keys onto function keys is not possible,
both because I want the punctuation mark echoed and it is
imperative that I know which punctuation mark it was -- info
which is lost during microtable redefinition.  Key-by-key
processing is also unrealistic due to a myriad of reasons,
primarily CPU.  Really, all I want is to make a JKEY out
of the following, and not lose the echoing:  ; , : . ! ?
I can even fake the echo if *key* would hold the real value.

Possible solution:  create a system variable  *rkey* which
would hold the _real_ value of *key* PRIOR to microtable
substitution.

That would take care of the problem if you could reference

in n1), but my problem is not that. I am working with many
multiple lenght buffers and so each time I want to check
a character it is with respect to the first character in

Or you could set up as many buffers with segments as you
need, i.e.
define  buf1=n1
        segment,char1=buf1,6
        buf2=n30
        segment,char2=buf2,6
        buf3=n75
        segment,char3=buf3,6
To use and indexed buffer, where the buffer is referenced
by one of a number of index variables, you define a segment
over the whole set of buffers, and then use a secondary
define to pinpoint the set of characters you need in the
buffer, like
define buf(x)= n9+6x)
       segment,charx=n10,6 $$ first define sets segments
       char(x,y)=charx(60x+y-60) $$ secondary define used
With this scheme, char(4,36) is char 36 in buf(4).
Thus any search needed on any buffer can be done using
only segment defines.

I personally have never found any great need to

people should give the implementation of this command
a very high priority; especially if, as the last
response may indicate, the implementation becomes
difficult or requires too many major changes in the
system program. While such a command would certainly
be nice, programming around the problem is not that
difficult. (or maybe I don't know all of the uses that
a no-margin at would solve)...

It is not a problem of cpu time or anything like that.
We just want to make sure that a no-margin -at- would not
introduce inconsistencies into the set of display
commands. For example, when the -locate- command did
NOT set margins, people had trouble titling graphs when
the title had more than one line or involved backspaces.
We've survived for a few years without it -- we can spend
a little while longer meditating....

---------- response 8
  08/18     11.08     parrello       uimatha

Yes, but the -at- without margins would be a purely optional
command. No one would have to use it if they wanted the
margins set, and if they used it by mistake, they could
always substitute the real -at- command. -locate- was
a different command, and a switch between -at- and -locate-
is much more difficult.

   Another option along the same lines that I would like to
see is a couple of key presses that when added to the end
of a write (or writec) would reset where but not reset the
margin. This would very useful when writing paragraphs in
which the text is writen with writes and writecs mixed
together. As it stands now it is difficult to keep the
margin straight when the end of each write resets the
margin.

Well..... A little bit of that is sort of right. Currently
it is true that a file must be "attached" for the block
copy option to work; if it is attached to you, this
prevents someone who has the change code from editing the

None of this has anything at all to do with the

Fix is easy.....

2. put the "back  zero" line in unit first after the
   arrow.

The "back zero" command will be reexecuted when returning
from unit "helpop". This is called post-arrow regular state
and AIDS indicates (correctly) that-arrow commands are
executed when returning from a helpop unit....

This is to announce a discussion of unionization of
programmers in general and plato programmers in specific
in the notes file in 'read310'. The discussion has been
going on for some time as it was announced in 'pad'.
Participants have asked for a general announcement to get
broader input from the plato programmer community.
I would especially like to hear from those who have spent
time in the traditional data processing industry.

People have requested before the ability to do a block
update without going to the block display page; the reply
has generally been that it's not all that hard to press
BACK and reenter the block. Quite true. The messy thing
appears to be to get back to the line you were at without
wasting several keypresses. Since the Q-option is capable
of returning you by pressing NEXT1 to the exact line you
left, would it be possible for the editor to have _its_ NEXT1
from the block display take you to the last line display
in the last block edited, instead of only the latter part?
I realize if you left the editor this info would be lost,
but it's primarily useful in editing when the system is
unstable, like now.

Does anyone know where a good leslist editor is?

Or for that matter, how to develop one?

        The leslist editor presently available leaves
alot desired. It would be nice to be able to add a lesson
at any position in the leslist, thereby makeing
'sectioning' of areas easier. Also, a method to store
comments in the leslist would be nice. That way, a person
could do an X-search for a particular code to see the
lesson area.

I don't believe you understand what I want. For example:

2. dogfight

I want to insert a lesson _between_ 1 and 2 without having
to retype the whole thing. No llist editor I know of
can do this, and that includes the systems editor and
the one in library.

It may seem unneeded, but when you are dealing with
a hundred or so lessons not in alphabetical order, it

   How about making the cursor in both the shift-term

i like the idea if the small cursor...but hoe about maybe

some burned-out dots.
     or perhaps an option that would permit 'flashing'
of the cursor, if it is hidden by existing screen material?

How about allowing the user to insert his own cursor symbol.
He could then use whatever was best for his use, even using
his own font characters or multi-character strings.
I have a cursor routine that allows this, and it is very
nice for positioning text, as the entire item may be used
as the cursor. (Unfortunately, mine does not yet produce
tutor code.)

I also have several other nice features in my routines,
and I invite whoever might be doing any revisions on the
ID or SD routines to contact me via P-notes for details.

We wanted to avoid using a special character so as not to
interfere with your charset loadings. Perhaps we should
try the period, now that it has four dots (it used to be
only one dot, which often failed to write).

         In any event the ability to flash the cursor
would be very helpful. Making it flash constantly
would probably tax the system too much but a single
erase then write, prehaps with NEXT, shouldn't be too hard.

Personally, I like the +. I think a period (.) would be
a mess to try line up-- are you going to use the lower
left corner, or the upper right? The plus lets you line
things up like cross-hairs.

   Plato authors have requested an -at- which does not

have been testing some new graphics features. It does not
seem to foul up anything so will be released to users soon.

  atom   (at which does not change Old Margin)

Votes for/against or other names (must begin with -at-) are
welcome. No prizes this time...I'm at remote site!
(Enterprising users may try this out if you can find it!)

Sample:

   Why does the name have to start with -at-? The command
is actually quite a bit different from at. How about calling
it -poke- since it enables one to poke some added words into
text without major surgery?

  Or the command could be called -tack- (which starts with
-ta- which, you'll notice, is -at- backwards). Thus if one
wishes to -tack- on some added text, the -tack- command's
function could be made mnenomically clear.

   This is a very useful command. Thanks for putting it
together.

I have discovered through trial and error that the maximum
size vocabulary which the condensor will tackle without
giving spurious *duplicate word* messages is about 4200
condensed words, which represents 2100 unique tokens. This
is several hundred words less than I need. Any chance of
extending this limit in the near future?
I also have a repeatable case of what appears to be the
vocabulary hashing routine creating two identical hashes
from two non-identical words. Symptom: another impossible
*duplicate word* condense error.

The *duplicate word* message was real, and not a result of
the hashing function; odd endings within a vocabulary can
hide a "word" so it can hardly be found.

But I now understand I have the largest vocabulary on the

Aw, come on you guys!  Lay off him. (I've already
received some notes about this!)?
It would take years and years to build a hypertext with
a comprehensive, or even useful, choice of variations
of chess openings.?
If he wants to make a catalog of selected openings, that
is OK. If he wants to *use* 14 blocks from lesson chess
that is OK too.?
But building a "tree" with several variations on each move
and backing up and testing variations -- that is a
complex bit of software, and is probably prohibitive in

CPU time as well.?
He needs some help pages. It would be nice to have a
running commentary in each game.?

I have foolishly fallen into a trap which may have caught
others as well. I requested a varian print of three lessons
for permanent documentation. I had heard that the varian
"prints out the characters you see on the screen". So, not
taking time to read the proper section of aids, I asked for
the print without including *list varian, charset, LESSON,
NAME. The resulting prints are a mess.

Errors like this could be alleviated by including a one line
warning in the request lesson. "To print your characters
properly, include - *list varian,charset,LESSON, NAME -
described in aids." This would save paper (expensive) and
time ( now I have to do it again) for people getting their
first varian prints.

there is still a problem with the label command.
for example:
origin  400,300
axes    -200,-100,100,100
scalex  9
labelx  0

with this code, the left most labels are shown as -***

---------- response 1
  08/20     11.02     shirer       s

   The problem is not the label command, it is your wacky
graph. Aids says clearly that the label command must make
certain assumptions about the format of the graph, and if
you don't like them, you are free to label the graph
yourself anyway you like. (use -locate- and -write-)

  The parameters you list label the graph every 5.4 units,
which is definitely not recommended of you expect people
to be able to read it.

  -label- must decide on the format (since you did not
specify major/minor intervals yourself) from one of the
end values. If xmax is non-zero, it uses this value.
Unfortunately your xleft needs one more decimal point.
Suggest you make right/left bounds symmetrical and
specify major/minor intervals as: labelx 5,1 to improve
readability. OK?

---------- response 2
  08/20     12.13     bailey       cerlcc

What has happened during the preceding weeks is that chil-

of playing games, but in the case of these children,
concomitant with playing is the issuing of loud, dis-

help...help...HELP..." What do I care? I am busy trying
to do some work which requires particular attention to

In the cases of the two mentioned offenders, I shall do more

For the problem in general, I can only repeat the CERL
policy.  PLATO students and PLATO authors have the right to
work undisturbed by noisy neighbors. If you are disturbed,
_demand_ that the noise stop.  You have a right to.  If need
be, ask the operator to enforce the rules.  Be sure to
complain to the course director.

We of the noble and esteemed order of operators (dis-
tinguished by the simple "o" next to our names) are
supposed to mediate insoluble conflicts in the classroom.
It is more effective, however, when other users let it be
known to the offending party/ies that their behavior is
objectionable.  When this doesn't work we will, ah, have
to resort to "other" measures.  We are reluctant to inhibit
courses but do so when necessary.

Ultimately, however, the course director is responsible for
the actions of persons she/he deems responsible enough to

Course directors are not forever, er, for a number of
reasons. It is much more reliable to pass the problem
on to the site director. The site director can then
get in touch with the course director and relate the
problem. At CERL Tebby Lyman is the site director
(tebby of pso). But at night the operator on duty is
the acting site director (term-" operator").

It is much easier and more reliable for such complaints
and comments to the course director to be routed through
one person rather than coming from a larger number of
users.

  08/21     03.43     blomme       s

   Two changes affecting the -use- command will be
 made very soon (hopefully this weekend):
(1) As previously stated, the meaning of the command will
  be changed so that all consecutive blocks with the same
  name will be taken when their shared name is -use-d.
  Remember that blocks with their partial flag set ARE
  condensed when -use-d.
(2)The name of the lesson to be -use-d will be kept as
  part of the lesson information (along with security
  codes, etc.) and the -use- command will then have
  only one argument in all cases: a block name. A
  conversion program will be run to change two argument
  commands to one and move the name of the lesson specified
  to the proper lesson directory word. The name will be
  changeable just like other lesson information (and the
  name of any -use- lesson will appear at the upper left
  of the main block display).

---------- response 1
  08/21     03.54     blomme       s

   Several different advantages are gained by the
system in making change (2). Currently the condenser
must halt its work when it encounters the 1st -use-
command and post a disk read request to get that other
lesson. With that information contained as part of
the main lesson's directory, all disk reading can be
completed before beginning to condense. Having the
information on any -use-d lesson as part of the lesson
directory will also be useful when the problems of
published lesson start to be faced (since obviously
any -use-d lesson must also be included in the "published"
category). And if some day references to lesson names
need to be changed to indices to a catalog or must have
prefixes added or whatever, then again this change will
help to make part of that process easier.

I might mention that Mr. Stackpole has told me the history
of the new keysets, which explains many of the problems.
In a hurry, with little opportunity to do extensive testing,
they had to retrofit to the old keyset design specs, which
caused most of the problems. While the electronic problems
are getting solved, some of the mechanical problems are
inherent to the present switch design. However, those
design problems which can be solved will be solved, short
of complete redesign of the entire keyswitch.

I have been using one of the new keysets for up to 4 hours
each day for the past week in an attempt to overcome the
normal problems of transition between different keysets.
The alteration does seems to overcome the "double key"
problem however the new keyset requires a higher amount
of force to insure positive contact than any of the older
keysets (this has been objectively verified). As a result,
I notice more fatigue after extended periods of typing.

This has already been communicated to Mr. Stackpole. I
concur with the observation that it is gratifying to see
such interest in customer problems and willingness to
seek information about the actual conditions of use.

    I agree with Dave Fuller, the _old_ keysets were the best
inspite of the noise problem (a room full of users sounded
like a flock of woodpeckers) because of the fast bottom out
they allowed. With little effort the key reached the max
of its displacement, but the springs were of sufficient
strength to recover quickly.
    If I remember correctly there are experimentally verified
recommendations for the optimum force needed for key
displacment in the Human Factors literature. However, very
few manufacturers ever pay any attention to research data
when designing man-machine systems. So I guess we should be

         Concerning the comment about the difference between
calculator's and terminal keyboards, IBM did extensive
research into keboard design during the development of
the 3270. IBM found that an audible 'click' and a positive
contact on the depression of the keys increased operator
efficency tremendously. The 'click' on the 3270's is
adjustable from silent to rather noisey. In personal use
I have found that a slight 'click' makes my typing much

I have a frequent problem while editing one lesson in hot
getting all the way out to the author page before typing in
the name of another lesson. The problem is most probably
that I press BACK BAcK too fast, and only one press is
accepted by the system. Consequently, the first letter of
the lesson name selects a block (usually "g"), and the
second a mode (usually "r" - replace), and then I must type
BACK BACK BACK to get out. Is there any possibility of
making BACK1 from the listing return one directly to the
author page? (It currently has no function.)

Also, the P option for setting partial flags is most
normally used just prior to condensing. Could STOP1 from
