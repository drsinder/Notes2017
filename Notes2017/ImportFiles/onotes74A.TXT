---------- note 1 calculator
  01/03     08.55     lederman       cerlcc

   Bruce, sounds like a good idea..the calculator
   but I can't seem to find it....DATA1 on the
   author mode page?....thanks....for when I find
   it........barb

---------- response 1
  01/03     09.27     lederman       cerlcc

could it be that this is an old version of plato?

---------- response 2
  01/03     09.57     b sherwood       phys

Yes, I assumed that PLATO would be reloaded sometime last
night, at which time this new feature would appear, but
insterd we have been running continuously since 9 pm last
night! Maybe by this afternoon?

---------- response 3

love the new calculator but there is on bug it allows you to convert from octal to alpha some lessons contain codes
which can now be very easily deciphered other then that its GREAT!!!!!! -starchild-

---------- note 2 request
  01/03     09.12     deiss       pharmacy

Now that more ECS and disk space is available, would it
be possible to turn on the request options for lessons
and courses to save long distance calls.

---------- response 1
  01/03     09.59     b sherwood       phys

This space is _not_ available yet. The equipment has arrived
and is being checked out. In particular, as the sign-in
note says, the new disks will not be operational for a
month or two. This is due to extensive software changes
needed to switch over.

thank you for pointing that out.

---------- note 7 erase
  01/03     10.31     rwb       mtcc

I do a lot of work where there is a display on the
screen and I only change the text. With this code:

erase 45,10 $$or however many i want

it takes quite a long time to erase it all.

So... would it be very difficult to have a method to
erase instantly ALL the contents of a certain area,
maybe using the format of the -window- command?
(Lower left postion and upper right position?)

Anyone else this would be helpful?

Thanks,
Dick

---------- response 1
  01/03     11.14     gfl       mtcc

would it ever!!! i too would like to see faster erase

---------- response 2
  01/03     11.16     b sherwood       phys

The two-argument erase command you are using is the
fastest thing currently possible. This is not a software
question: the terminal currently has no machinery in
it to respond to an order from your lesson to erase a
block instantaneously. CERL engineers led by Roger
Johnson have successfully modified plasma panels to
have a block erase feature, which we all feel is important.
It is hoped that Owens-Illinois (the panel manufacturers)
will agree to the minor modification necessary to
implement a block erase capability. It would also be
necessary to modify the Magnavox terminal to accept block
erase commands from the computer and drive the panel.

If all of this can be done, then the two-argument erase
command will erase a block almost instantaneously. Note
that no change to your lesson will be necessary.

---------- response 3
  01/03     11.24     rwb       mtcc
Sounds good...
Thanks for the explanation!

Dick

---------- response 4
  01/03     11.25     tenczar       s

Indeed, the two-argument erase command was installed in
the hopes of eventually having a "fast" block erase.

---------- response 5
  01/03     13.27     shlosberg       com

how about a four argument erase that could erase any
four-sided figure's interior (the four arguments being
the corner points).
this would be an extremely useful feature even if it wasn't
instantaneous!

---------- note 14 int/frac
  01/03     11.30     b sherwood       phys

In response to a request, I intend to lower the roundoff
tolerance on the "int" and "frac" function from the
present (poorly-chosen) 10?ˆ-6?? to 10?ˆ-9??, which is more
in keeping with the similar 10?ˆ-9?? tolerance on the "="
test for floating-point numbers. Any objections?

I'm referring to the fact that TUTOR considers the
fractional part of 1.0000001 to be 0 and the integral
part of 2.9999999 to be 3. This is probably too gross
a correction for the computer's inevitable round-off
mistakes. The change would mean that a number would
have to differ from an integer by more than 10?ˆ-9?? to
have a non-zero fractional part.

---------- response 1
  01/03     12.00     rowell       uicc

Thank you!

---------- response 2
  01/03     20.04     keasler       m

Would it be possible to make the "int" function
a true truncation to give access to an "integer" divide.
This would have to be combined with making "frac" return
the fraction truncated. It is easier to achieve rounding
with truncation than trying to truncate a rounded number.

---------- response 3
  01/04     08.33     b sherwood       s
Suppose your number is 3.999999999999, which TUTOR will
say has int(x)=4, frac(x)=0. If you really want the
"true" fractional part, even tho it may be due to roundoff
errors in preceding calc's, try (int(x)-x), which is
4-3.999999999999, or .000000000001.

---------- note 15 modulo
  01/03     11.50     trollip       arlc

In note 365 I asked about a system function for modulo
numbers. I have a modulo define as suggested in the replies
to that note, but what I really need is a system function
like frac or int. In my program I use a lot of modulo's
very often. Any faster way of achieving the same result as
one put in defines would be great.The only faster way seems
to be a system feature.
It would be
modulo(xx,zz)
where xx was the base and zz the number to be modulated.
Is there any chance of this? I am sure many people could
it!

---------- response 1
  01/03     12.51     b sherwood       s

As far as I can tell, a system function would not be
noticeably faster, since the same operations must be
performed: divide, take fractional part, and multiply.

It would of course be convenient even if not faster.
It would probably take the form
a $mod$ b
rather than
mod(b,a)
if it were implemented.

---------- response 2
  01/03     13.12     layman       matha

I just tried a different mod function which runs about 10x
as fast as the one I suggested in the last notes:
mod(expr,n)=expr$mask$(n-1).

You may notice that your printout is on the unlined
side of the paper. This has been done for possible better
readablility. Please leave your opinion here.

  01/03     12.44     layman       matha

If the print paper has the dark black lines (like I've
recently got), then definely load the printer w/ the blank
side up. It's never been a hassle reading when the paper's
lines are lt.grey or green, however. TomL

---------- response 2
  01/04     08.26     e avner       cerlcc

i prefer the blank side up since the printer often gets out
of phase with the lines. if the ribbon happens to be
well worn, the print is rather difficult to read.

---------- note 18 from bug
  01/03     12.14     friedman       csa

Notes have been re-initialized, so I'll ask again...?
Is there any chance that the -from- command will be fixed,
so that it will work as advertised when used after a
failing -jumpout-? (See the discussion in old notes,
section k, ¬$294, main note and 3rd response.)

---------- response 1
  01/04     08.34     b sherwood       s

We're thinking. Thanks for pointing this out.

---------- note 21 Kohoutek

PPI

        If you don't know already Tom Layman has made it
easy to find Kohoutek. All you need do is look in lesson
platopress to find out where to look.
        The Plato Press has had over 200 readers. And this
second part has had already nearly 100 readers. This is
encouraging. Hopefully this semester we will be able to
implement a full scale "rag".

---------- note 25 exit--aids
  01/03     15.16     gmp       matha

the following feature is undocumented in aids

exit condition
If the condition equals -1, that is equivalent to

exit $$no tag -- exit all levels

---------- note 26 -back1-
  01/03     16.30     warner       iu

Why is there no -BACK1- command? In a HELP sequence, I
realize that BACK1 is supposed to take you to the base
unit. But what about using BACK1 in a main unit? I have
looked in the writeups in aids, and have found no mention
of a -BACK1- command; in fact term "back1" jumps you
directly to the discussion on keyanames! Furthermore,
when I insert a command of the form -back1 unit-
in my lesson, it is taken as a condense error. Is there
some special reason that BACK1 cannot be used as a branch?
Surely the value of the back1 unit could simply be altered
to baseu on encountering a help sequence.
I would like to have -BACK1- available without the necessity
of a pause and a conditional jump, to take students to
the next turn in mastery3. Sometimes it works, but sometimes
it doesn't, entirely depending on the exact sequence of
keys pressed previously!

---------- response 1
  01/03     17.18     judy       pso

One problem with changing the meaning of -BACK1- from
help to main units is that often a series of units is
used as a main seqence when reached from one place and a
help sequence when reached from a different part of the
lesson.

---------- response 2
  01/04     08.20     warner       tutoring

But why not just change the value of the back1 unit
to the base unit whenever a help sequence is entered,
or whenever the base unit is changed by a -base- command,
and then let -back1- commands change the back1 unit
where programmed? This would not change the operation
of any lesson unless a -back1- command was specifically
inserted.

---------- response 3
  01/04     22.44     midden       p

How about using the conditional base command...
base someunit
...or....
base expression,unit1,unit2,...

---------- note 32 sin/cos
  01/03     22.04     b sherwood       s
Minor change to sine and cosine functions. It used to
be that sin(1/0) or cos(1/0) gave an execution error,
but now it gives the result 0/0 ("indefinite"). The
idea is that the sine or cosine of an infinite angle
is indefinite--it may be anywhere between -1 and +1.

---------- note 37 Mvo/Mv1
  01/04     09.42     jim schuyler       nuc

Where can I find a list of the characters stored in Mvo and
Mv1 of my terminal? I find that they do not correspond to
the schema in Jack Stifle's CERL publication on the
Plasma Display Terminal (for example, "," and "." are
in Mv1 rather than Mv0, where that publication lists them
and []+-?= and / have been moved by one location).
P.S. -- I know that I can't access them from TUTOR
but, I need to know where they are nevertheless.

---------- response 1
  01/04     15.04     blomme       s

   You can simply use the plot command to display the
"wired in" characters. For example:

plot     128       $$ plots char 0, mem 0
plot     190       $$ plots char 62, mem 0
plot     192       $$ plots char 0, mem 1
plot     254       $$ plots char 62, mem 1

   Note that " character" 63 of every memory is not a
character at all, but in conjunction with the following
character specifies a function--like change character
memory, carriage return, or backspace.
    See also lesson keyset regarding characters in old
character memories that are not in new ones and new
characters which have been added. All terminals will
eventually be changed to have the new memories.

all's well.....thanks....

---------- note 39 shows
  01/04     10.42     lederman       cerlcc

Currently the -shows- and embedded -shows-
work as follows....?
calc        v1?1
shows       v1,1           $$shows a single digit
            $$namely....1?
however...?
calc        v1?1
shows       v1,1           $$shows: 0.0?
please....have it show the single digit 0 to be
consistent with the other numbers....
thank you...(ps...I asked this before...and was
told that indeed 0 is the desired result.)

---------- response 1
  01/04     17.00     rader       s

It is showing a single significant digit, to be consistent
with the other numbers. E.g., "shows v1?.3,1" will show
0.3, where the leading 0 is not significant.

Don't give up all hope, however. There are several
things that can be done. You can use integer variables
when you know that you in fact want integers, and they
will show as you desire. Or, we can discuss changing
the definition of the -shows- command, to take into
account people who are really working with integers,
but in floating point format. One suggestion is that
we check whether (in your example) frac(v1) is zero
(i.e., less than 10?^-9V)--and then show it as an integer.
This would change the operation of the command for others,
however--so let's hear some discussion as to what the
real needs are.

---------- note 40 bas extime
  01/04     10.50     john r       r1

Incrementing a variable in a branching calc loop gave me the
following data.
*
calc n1?n1+1 $$ simplest case
*
calc n(1)?n(1)+1 $$ no difference in exec time
*
If -tem- is a defined constant
calc n(tem)?n(tem)+1 $$ costs 1¬ms per iteration more
*
If -tem- is a variable
calc n(tem)?n(tem)+1 $$ costs 10¬ms per iteration more

Do these numbers seem approximately right?

---------- response 1
  01/04     13.20     andersen       s

Well...
n1?n1+1
n(1)?n(1)+1
n(tem)?n(tem)+1 $$ tem = constant

All take exactly the same amount of time

n(n1)?n(n1)?1
Takes about 8 microseconds longer (at present)

---------- response 2
  01/04     14.22     john r       r1

Thank you. I thought that my test on the case of a defined
constant might have been a little "noisy".

The whole issue arose because it is often convenient to
define work variables in terms of arrays rather than in
terms of specifically named variables. It appears that
where -tem- is a constant I can talk about n(tem), n(tem+1)
and so forth as economically as I can talk about n1, n2 and
so forth. Is that correct?

---------- response 3
  01/04     16.18     andersen       s

yes

---------- response 4
  01/04     16.54     thomasson       users

Is this also true for *compute* ?

---------- response 5
  01/04     17.01     b sherwood       s

For -compute-, the compile will take longer, but the
execution is unaffected by the form, just as with a
-calc-. That is, it takes longer to convert the string
to machine code, but the same machine code is generated
whether you say v5 or v(5) or v(1+4) or v(lit), where
lit is defined to be 5.

---------- note 44 ext bomb
  01/04     15.11     rowell       e

The new ext option seems to be bombing oitc.
We tried the following procedure and received an exec.
error as described.

The person who was signed in on the terminal with the beeper
had his ext options set to no.
A person at another terminal tried calling that terminal
via oitc and received:

exec error in unit exrng
last command- ext
join ring 9

We tried it several times with the options on and off
and consistently received the above error when they were
turned off.....when they were on, oitc worked normally.

---------- response 1
  01/04     16.58     ldf       mtcc

thanks for the info---think i finally found it
It had to do with some undisclosed changes in the number
of -ext-/sec that one can execute (apparently) anyway
i can't make it fail anymore---please report any failures
to me (in "itc") is fine---that's working too....now)

---------- note 50 next1 ?
  01/04     17.33     friedman       csa

Warner's discussion of -back1- reminds me that I found out,
also the hard way, that there is no -next1- command.
Is there any particular reason? Why NOT have a -next1-
command?

---------- response 1
  01/04     21.57     b sherwood       s

Frankly, I am not sure why we do not have -next1- and
-back1- commands. I thought I understood at one time
why we do not have a -back1- command, altho I'm no
longer sure I understand. I can't even remember ever
having thought I understood why there is no -next1-
command! Let us think this thru a little--maybe we'll
install both.

---------- response 2
  01/04     22.47     midden       p

I use the base command as a substitute for back1...
but this does have its drawbacks.

---------- note 52 sorry
  01/04     22.07     b sherwood       s

We have been as discouraged as you today with the
system crashing repeatedly. Everyone here has been
working hard to find the trouble. PLATO has stayed up for
several hours this evening, which is hopeful, altho we
did not hink that what we fixed so far was responsible
for the many crashes. We apologize for the poor service
and hope that operations this weekend will show great
improvement.

Does anyone have a program written for "clock",that would
instead of saying 13.10.10 it would say 1.10.10?

See routing near the end of block "math/time" in lesson
"library". Just save the lines there and move them to
your lesson.

Here is slightly shorter version...

A quick test showed that this method uses 11 words less
than Bruce's, and uses 1 variable instead of 4. But if
you don't want to go crazy figuring out how it works, use
Bruce's method.

Dear Mr. Frankel,

'Tis very helpful to have RDRAW in the ID option.
Are you planning to show RDRAWs with the SD option? This
would be very nice too.

Your friend,
bonnie anderson

P.S. If so, SOON I hope.

I am planning it, and soon too....but I don't know how soon.
Deep down inside, I really am thinking about it. I have
to go back to school tomorrow, so....

---------- note 59 E option
  01/05     20.14     john r       r1

E is very nice indeed David. Now, how about a scrunch
option that will collapse two blocks together if there's
room in the first. Suggested 'command': F (for fold),
H (for hunker), J (for jam), K (for kollapse), M (for
merge), T (for telescope), or W (for wedge).

---------- response 1
  01/06     12.51     frankel       p

OK...I guess I'll write a common editor after I put rdraw
in SD and put in some sort of block crunching option....
These should be around soon.....

---------- note 60 sys-reply
  01/05     23.14     newman       csa

Just an idea -- when reading NEW SYSTEM FEATURES, how about
making -SHIFT LAB- active to branch the reader or author to
the write mode of GENERAL INTEREST notes -- in other words,
making it just a little easier to leave "replies" and
comments on new system features without having to -SHIFT
BACK- several times and then entering write mode. Let
concerned authors "reply" the same way they do to general
notes!!
Jim Newman

---------- response 1
  01/06     10.16     rader       s

There are many imperfections in the current notes scheme;
we often leave a note in general notes so that it is
easier for you to reply to a system announcement.

---------- response 2
  01/06     23.43     newman       csa

Well, instead of just saying "Things are imperfect",
which seems to be a standard response too many times,
how about indicating whether it could be taken care of.
I think that this must be a very simple change.

---------- response 3
  01/07     09.47     rader       s

It is a simple change, but requires attention to such
details as a) exactly where should you be branched to? and
is there perhaps an even better way to handle the problem?
and b) whether this is actually a hot, immediate problem
that requires an instant solution.

Assuming that the second is not true, perhaps David Woolley
can change "notes" so that "lab1" in "system features"
at least takes you out to the main display page??

---------- note 64 find
  01/06     15.27     gmp       matha

it would be nice to have a find command with another
optional argument that would let you specify that every
nVth?^ word in a list should be checked, where the default
value for n is 1.
glenn m. polin

---------- response 1
  01/06     16.53     frankel       p

   Actually, all the planning was completed over a month
ago! All that remains is for Rim Mast to do (complete)
the coding for it and then write the conversion to convert
current finds (will affect only those that use mask--these
will require a "1" preceding the mask to set the increment
to 1). Hopefully the new -find- with specifiable increment
and the -findall- will be available within a few weeks--

How about another argument on the search so one can specify
also that every nth word be checked, i.e., so one could
search nc1-nc1500, say, but only even variables say, by
using an 8th argument of 2? Or will the changes to the
find command allow this?

Chess3.5 was inhibited by the authors because what the

chess3.5 brings up a "job" to do the actual checking and

character "N" without remembering (or figuring out) that

Nothing is wrong...when the condensor condenses a line, it
checks to see if there is a $$ comment...if there is, it
backs up to the first non-space character and tells itself
that the line ends there...this is the way it has to be, or
else you would end up putting all your comments right at the
end of the line:

at 1010$$screen location
write This is a lesson$$explain what is going on

off the comment _and_ the two spaces, because it doesnt know
what you want, and that is the way it works on all other

It would be easier for many people to think in terms of no.

too much trouble (I think). But I don't believe anyone doing
programming on Plato would be unable to grasp what octals
are about. In any event, you limit yourself to values less
than your capable for achieving (w/bit length). If you pick
2 dec digits, you use 7 bits, but limit yourself to values
up to 99; ¬$s 100-127 are lost. If your variables run ¬< 25,
say, 2 bits go unused. If you know a variable will have
values ¬<3, why reserve enough room to achieve numbers up to
15? For economical use of space, one should use only whats
needed, by specifying the bit-length of the segment.L

I, for one, don't understand the problem. If the lessons
of which you wish to use part are your own, the checks to
be made must be simple indeed. If the lessons belong to
other people, then you are dangerously relying on their
goodwill and their memory by expecting them to freeze
both their lesson structure and their unit names.

The only "check" that needs to be made to use parts of
someone else's lessons is a simple unit that can be -do-ne
at all critical points:
unit    check
goto    nr1="somecode",x,q
jumpout 0

The greater convenience of the proposed -routend- command
should be obvious, but two more things are of greater im-
portance: 1) if a a well-done, popular lesson is to be
used by several routers on a sectional basis, the author
of the lesson must make checks for each router's desires at
the start of each unit, -- using a -transfr-, since use of
nr within a routed lesson is illegal  --, probably via an
-imain-command; 2) it can hardly be expected that authors
should be responsible for supervising their lessons forever;
authors do leave and/or lessons become "finished". Your
argument about trusting the author not to change the struc-
ture of his lesson could be used as an argument against
2-arg jumpouts, which I don't think you intend

If somebody else has advertised a lesson as being stable

to have programmed -end lesson-s or -jumpout 0-s in all
the appropriate places, and I would further expect my

rely on even a one argument jumpout to a lesson that was
not under my control.

I reiterate the opinion that the potential of the router

it has virtually total control over the sequencing of the
student. As it is now, I can think of nothing that a router
lesson can do which could not be duplicated by the use of
course records and a regular lesson except recover from
execution errors, memory exceeded, and effectively have
50 more student variables and two commons. The router
should be able to have TOTAL sequencing control. Would any

I don't agree that the routher should be able to stop just
anywhere. After all, a teacher desings a lesson as an
entity which is supposed to make certain points. If you
stop just anywhere, you may invalidate a sequence which he
is developing. As far as stopping at specific unit names,
many instructors are not going to allow you to roam around
in their lessons looking for unit names. I would expect
that a finished lesson would have both change and inspect
codes, and you would have to stop where the instructor
has planned for you to stop. I know of at least one series
like that now.... (and it's being extensively used, too).

What would be necessary would be to establish a system
variable *routend* which the router would set. Upon
jumping out to the routed lesson, *routend* would
be zeroed unless the new jumpout codeword of the router
matches the jumpout code of the routed lesson. Thus,
routers would presumably have the permission of the author
of the routed lesson to use only a portion of the lesson.
Remember, the finish unit of the routed lesson would
still be executed for counter clean-up.

Here'5 a suggestion that would probably be a helluva
thing to implement, but here goes nothing:

How hard would it be to introduce a screen-dependent
breakpoint feature, such that whenever a given (specified)
point on the screen is addressed by a lesson, an execution-
error-like display is generated showing the unit and
command responsible, together with the join nesting.
Since many,many lessons generate a single display by an
incredibly complex sequence, this (or, probably, and even
more general breakpoint facility) might see some demand. 
Use of the new -imain- for debugging could alleviate some
of this, but graphing with -do-'s and loops and such can
be a real pest to debug. How about it? Anyone out there
like the idea? One of our authors came up with this, and
I like the concept.

I believe that a debugging feature is in the development

But it seems unlikely that anything will come until they
get rid of those pesky output errors!

How about adding an option to search the entire lesson

Also, how about telling where a unit is referenced if it
cannot be found during condense - or, failing that, at
least how many times it is referenced along with one
place it is referenced ? (how do you other authors feel..?)
  Also, give the index value for array errors.

Such a feature has already been written, and is called the
Y directive in edit. Unless it has been totally destroyed,
it is available only to system programmers because of the
number of disk accesses required (1 per block).

About something to search the entire lesson...
        That would require an awful lot of disk accesses,
like maybe 14 or 28...the system people have discussed such
a feature, and we feel that our disk system would not be
able to support such a feature...also, when people wanted
to find something, rather than thinking about what block
it should be in, they would (maybe) just go into the first
block and search from there. That' an awful lot of disk
accesses and an awful lot of CPU time. Someday a feature
of this sort might be available in a different form (don't
ask me what form, though). By the way, when I say "we dis-
cussed it" and then "we feel", I mean that from the dis-
cussion I thought we felt that way.

T is for resetting the tabs so that one might write

The above note and response might betray to an observer
an irresponsible approach to the use of PLATO. The fact of 
the matter is, in the above response, our terminal once
again broke down. In addition to our great frustration,
it remains virtually impossible for Springfield High
programmers to do anything decent, and all atttempts at
classroom usage of the Springfield terminal are futile
because of terminal failures. I suggest that, if anyone
wants to see SHS do something decent, we first would have 
to have decent facilities.

One other thing that should be fixed or documented in

In my experiment, -STOP- was the only key active when

You will not in this decade be able to "step thru each
line of a continued -calc-", because successive -calc-
statements are all bunched together into one long
calculation for speed. It is conceivable that some day
you might step from one -branch- to the next or thru
successive iterations of a -doto-. Therefore the editing 
line numbers are only loosely tied to the execution
line numbers. Another case is non-executable statements
such as -define- and -vocab-. Maybe some day the print 
routine might keep all this in mind, but it would involve
a lot of extra processing.

       I guess this is another case of someone having
thought out the obvious much more carefully than I did...
my note on "breakpoint" is now thoroughly obsolete, thanks
to the -step- option. The only other debugging aid I can
possibly think of now that I need frequently is some sort
of access to the levels of "join" currently in effect -
either through -step- or in some system variable stack
of length 10. The latter would be easier to implement,
I should think, since the info _must_ be available, but
the former would be a more unified approach. I can cer-

David Andersen reports that displaying the -join- stack
is rather difficult, for highly technical reasons. You'll
just have to take notes, as you step, of the units you
pass thru in your -join- sequence. 

Incidentally, the "step" machinery, like the student
response data logging, "talk", "consult", and monitoring,
uses subroutines written in TUTOR, not assembly
language. So there is an increasing amount of system
software itself written in TUTOR.

    The step option is nice, but the part that shows the
variables could be improved if one was allowed to type
in the define name. Typing in the variable number defeats
some of the purpose to define names, because in order to 
debug, on must still remember which variable number his
define is attached to. One could also inspect segmented
variables, etc. if they were able to type in the define
name. Presently if I want to see the values of my define
names I have to use a define -student- and a compute state-

Would this be possible?: When the system first comes up
in the morning, or when it comes back up after being down, 
how about sending a beeper signal to all sites? This would
eliminate the neccesity of monitoring the terminals all the 
time when the system is down. This would be especially
helpful in cases (like ours) where the terminals are
somewhat remote from the regular work area, so that we have
to keep running back and forth to see if the system has come
up. The signal should be unlike the regular message beeps,
like maybe long-short-long-short or something.

---------- response 1

You imply that sites have "beepers", but that is not a 
general situation: I think there are only a few such
devices on the network. So it is not a general but a 
specific thing. I don't know whether it is feasible for 
us to do or not.

     I don't know about anyone else, but I have equipment
using the external channels of the terminals. It would 
be unfortunate if this equipment had to be redesigned
to ignore special system generated external signals.
     This would put me, as well as many other people, in 
the situation of having something as transitory as the
system software dictating the structure of hardware.
     This would be an unfortunate situation, indeed.
     An alternate solution:
     Build external devices which look at the data
lines on a terminal (new _or_ old) and generate a signal
whenever you see a LOW state coming from the terminal,
no matter what the state of the data ready signal is.
(all of this data is always high when there is no output 
coming to the terminal, but it reflects the state of 
the output to the terminal when there is some.)
     No software is ne_c_e_ss_ary.

All this hardware talk is very confusing. Do you mean that
it is possible with no change to the PLATO system to build 
a device that would make noise whenever output is coming?
  Also, I don't think I'd want the noise going all the time.

---------- response 5
  01/13     04.27     sjg     users
   It would be possible to build a device that would 
alert people when the system came back up without a change
to the plato system because plato already plots the
"press next to begin" message (which should be "please
stand bye") when it comes up. This output is what would 
trigger such a hypothetical alert device. 
   Such a device would not make noise all of the time,
because a site operator would turn it on only when he
wants to be alerted to the revitalization of the plato 
system, i.e. when the system is down.

A command with a format such as

  01/11     13.00     friedman       csa

There is a long-standing problem with the "mode" system
variable. Suppose I save "mode" in a student variable,
then execute "mode erase", then arrow, and after endarrow,
I use the saved variable in a conditional "mode" command
to restore the previous mode. OK? Now, at such an arrow,
instead of entering an answer, I press a help-type key
and exit to another unit. If the second unit has similar
code, the value of system variable "mode" stored in the 
help unit will indicate mode erase; but the screen will be 
in mode write (as it should be; one wouldn't want the 
erase mode carried over into the help unit!).?
For more on this, and sample code, see lesson "cscomments",
block "csauthors3".?
The problem is that the screen is in write mode, but the
system variable has the wrong value.?
Any prospects for a fix?

If you're looking for opinions, I vote for Gooch's

the usual "boundaries" (blanks, punctuation, etc.).?
There's a similar annoyance with the "constructed"symbols
for embed: ¬0 and ¬1. They are treated as straight
alphanumerics, and when editing aroung them, they get
copied and erased along with their neighbor characters.
Could this also be changed?

Indeed, what Mr. SGS says is true and a system error...
somehow when I wrote the "erase1" routine, I made the
aforementioned mistake...it will be fixed soon.

By the way...because of the rather long and somewhat
misleading discussion of this point...

ERASE...is meant to erase the last character.
ERASE1..is meant to erase the last word (even if only
        _one_ character in length!).
EDIT....is meant to erase the whole line (and prepares
        for the line edit feature on succeding keypresses

of editing is a known fact...which Don Lee will fix when he

Please don't make this change!
In my lessons students are asked to input numerical (and
other) data for later use in a long series of units. If
the student makes a mistake and wants to change a previous
answer, he presses -BACK- until he reaches the unit asking 
for the number he wants to change. Then -back1- returns 
him to his original unit. With the change, there would 
be no way to get back to the original position without 
retyping all the answers inbetween too, as many as 12

empire, it proved not to work. The timeup key appeared
anyway, despite the large-tagged time. This change is 
sorely needed in many lessons, to prevent spurious timeup
keys from showing up in subsequent arrows of a lesson.

There seem to be a couple of errors:
Function keys in caps (BACK on page 2 of -pause-) cause
a condense error. 
pause .8 $$ does not allow other keys to break through

Hey! How about a -dlong- command. It would have the effect
of a -long- command but would operate on the _display_ length
of a string rather than the number of six bit character 
codes.

If it would be impractical to make the appropriate checks 
during a student's typing, how about a form of the command
that would set a variable named in the tag to the display
length. At least one could then do one's own checking and 
judging. Or a -dcount- analog to -jcount-?
'Twould be very useful for anyone trying to format student-
generated displays for later insertion into predefined
frames on the screen.

   This brings up something I've been meaning to
mention for some time now. On the new terminals,
the "Press NEXT to begin" page gets garbled if the
student presses next while "lesson PLATO not available"
is in effect. I guess this is the result of the
changeover in the standard fonts, but for a student
on one of these terminals, this can be very aggrevating.
Adding the line "Press BACK" wouldn't do any good, as
it would come out garbled also. For the sake of the
students, please consider this.

            light?                             s                    slightly light?

I am very definitely aware of Mr. Patterson's efforts.
In fact, it was he who made up the preceding table.
It was just decided this afternoon that the microfiche
that we got was unacceptable for classes. Since the
classes begin running on PLATO next Monday, it was a bit
doubtful whether a new microfiche could be prepared in time.
Such schemes were being debated as temporarily hooking the
ext jack of the terminal to a Carousel projector.
Hence, I tried to contact you in order to cut down the
order lead time for microfiches below the advertised month.
I am EXCEEDINGLY glad that this effort will pay off!

Note that in sending exposure corrections for microfiche,
it is in fact very much better to simply say that the
picture is light, very light, etc. Unless you have had
considerable experience with photomicrography film you
will be very suprised what a 1 f stop change will do.
Most corrections are in the range of 1/4 to 1/2 f stop.

Could the -pause- and -group- commands be extended to

Starting in unit -test-, we press -help-.
Now the -next- key (at the -end- command) will return
to the base unit (namely -test-), and the -back1- key
will move on to unit -back1-.
In unit -back1- then the base unit still is -test-.
Issuing a -back1 q- command in unit -help- does not
overwrite the return function normally provided by -back1-.

-back1 q- hence does not overwrite the normal function of
the -back1- key.
-back1 back1- and -base back1- have different results,
only the latter would cause the -next- key at the -end-
command to return to unit -back1-.

Is this all consistent or subject to change?

---------- response 1
  01/16     15.41     midden       p

This appears to be exactly the way it should be.
The back1 command is just like the next command.
Back1 means that it will branch there if back1 is pressed.
Base is much different in that it sets up a base unit
be returned to on end commands and by pressing back1.
It would appear that back1 has priority over base(temp.).

Note that if you put base back1 in unit help and pressed
back1 you would goto unit back1.
I hope this is helpful(?)

Seems to be fixed now, but the jumpout "was NOT executed",?
What good is aids if the jumpouts always fail?!!?
There ought to be some priority for aids. One can
condense the aids index, because an author can always
condense; but from the index, one can't get anywhere,
because the jumpout fails, and no one knows the name of
the lesson to jump to! Arghhhhhhhhhhh!

  01/16     15.41     friedman       csa

The new pause is better than the one we had before, but
with all its flexibility, it still isn't quite what I
need. Problem: How does one have a two-part display
on the screen, of which the student first sees one part,
then presses next (not any of a bunch of keys, but just
NEXT) to get to the second? He should also be able to
completely exit the unit by pressing a help-type key,
but only if the appropriate help-type command has been
executed in the unit. Now, "pause keys=funct" does not
quite do this; if, for example, there has been no -lab-
command in the unit, the lab key will act like next;
whereas if the two parts of the display were in separate
units, lab would be ignored. I don't see how to get
this, without writing a list of keynames into the pause
command in each unit, with a different list each time;
but I want to put the pause into a joined unit.

---------- response 1
  01/16     17.24     andersen       s

You must list the keys -- however -- it should be an
extremely trivial task to program a loop which goes back
into the pause if a -help- or -lab- key comes through the
pause because no unit was specified --- perhaps I dont
understand the problem??

---------- response 2
  01/17     09.04     friedman       csa

You're right, and I suppose I will program such a loop.
It would certainly be nice if the system provided a
feature that, for the purpose of continuing, acted like
the transition between units--i.e., one didn't have to
program around this problem.

Wouldn't it be possible for you to use two units for the
two parts of your display:

inhibit erase
help    helpunits
nextnow two
** display 1
unit    two
** display 2

---------- response 4
  01/17     14.33     friedman       csa

Yes, but that causes more troubles. Just coding it, for
one; when I begin a new unit, at minimum, there's a back
command; sometimes also help, etc.; plus the inhibit erase
requires much care to put erase commands at the beginning
of back and help-type units; etc., etc., etc.?
My main point is that one shouldn't _have_ to invent ways
to make the system behave reasonably (and I don't think
my definition of "reasonable" is either arbitrary, wild,
or unrealistic).

---------- response 1
  01/18     09.03     michael       cerlcc

I shouldn't think so, John, as a help sequence will not be
initiated by a help key breaking through a keys=help pause
even though the unit has a help unit specifid in it. Key
swallowing still takes place. But what about:

unit    a
help    b
pause   keys=anything BUT help
write   something

Should a help key pressed here initiate a help sequence?

---------- response 2
  01/18     10.14     rader       s

If a -help- sequence has been set up and the help key is
specified in "keys=help", the help branch will be taken;
if no help unit has been specified, the key will fall
through.
In general, if a function key is "activated" at a keys-type
pause, that function key will initiate the usual action
if specified; otherwise it merely serves to break the
pause, with "key" set to the key pressed.

Thus it would be consistent for the erase unit to be
joined (when specified). Now to talk to Dave Andersen...

Note that if all you wanted was for the key to break the
pause, you must de-specify those function keys; if you
wanted the -term- key, you might succeed for students.
And if all you wanted was for the function keys to be
active, you must remember that if the action is not
specified, the key will fall through the pause.

I've tried it, and it seems to apply.
I.e., with pause keys=term or equivalent,
pressing term will cause the "what term" message to appear;
if the term is found, it will be taken; if it is not
found, the pause is broken, and the unit continues
past the pause.

---------- response 5
  01/18     16.53     rader       s

Back to the question of the erase unit being executed...
the -eraseu- command and the erase unit are very much
associated with the -arrow-...down even to the final judge
exit. To put it another way, the "erase" key is not
a function key like the other function keys. At an arrow,
the erase unit is joined if any of (erase, erase1, edit,
or next) are ppressed.

It seems unlikely that the -eraseu- machinery can be fit
into the -pause keys=- machinery...what you may be asking
for is an -arrow-?

---------- response 1
  01/18     12.56     warner       tutoring

The expression you have there is evaluated as
(4=4)$and$ (2=-1)
which obviously is not true, since the second part is false.
You need parentheses as follows,
((4=4)$and$2)=-1
The result of an $and$ operator is set to -1 if both of
the arguments are _non-zero_. Thus for the purposes of an
$and$, 2 is true. The same is ture of $or$.

See SHIFT-TERM "and" in aids. Use the calculator at the end
of this section to try various logical expressions.

---------- response 2
  01/18     13.20     bloomfield       psa

Mr. Warner: You seem to have missed the point in
Hanna's problem. There is a system ?bug? in the $and$ and
$or$ operations. Instead of looking for negative as true
and non-negative (¬>0), $and$ and $or$ look for 0 as false
and anything else as true (such as 2¬p,1 and 10ˆ9). This
forces you to say n2<0$and$n3<0 instead of n2$and$n3 which
takes up 4 words more and two unnecessary compares. $and$
and $or$ are impossible to use in their present form without
those extra compares. If it worked on negative and non-neg,
there would be many, many cases where no compare need be
used. Please consider changing it as it would probably
not take any more time than it does now. (branch on negative
instead of branch on non-zero)
---------- response 3
  01/18     14.53     hanna       matha

It seems to me that most system variables use -1 as
a "special" value such as "not matched". Also the
way conditionals are handled would indicate that
having negative values represent "true" and values
¬>0 represent "false" would be much more consistent.

---------- response 4
  01/18     15.12     warner       tutoring

I agree with everybody who has commented so far!
It makes little sense to have negative values only
score as true in say, jumps or writec's, and have
any nonzero value score as true in the logical operators.
But that's the way it is, and I told hanna that.

---------- response 5
  01/18     16.42     blomme       s

I am not clear as to whether or not a change here is
called for. The main point is that $and$ and $or$ are
relational operators dealing with truth values. If you
are using "non-truth values" as inputs, then you might
expect strange things to happen. Note: n1 $and$ n2
is a perfectly fine statement and (n1<0) $and$ (n2<0) is
NOT required IF both n1 and n2 are truth values! If
they are not truth values, then you are somehow trying
to play special games with your "in" knowledge of how
the tests are made. So: (1) stick to truth values
(2) conceivably the method of dealing with "error" cases
could be changed in the future.

---------- response 6
  01/21     08.25     cupec       csa

I agree. If you are not using the correct operands
you should not expect a correct answer. There are only two
logical values, true and false which on this system are -1
and 0. If someone uses 10ˆ9 he or she should be flagged
with an execution error. I'm sure none of the people that
initiated this note want an execution error for their
special uses ( I had a bout long ago with -0 which Bruce
finally patched) but perhaps the error message would
force people to get the correct (desired ?) result.

---------- response 7
  01/21     12.56     warner       tutoring

The point of this complaint is to make $and$, $or$, etc.
operate in a consistent manner in conditional commands.
For instance, the command
do      n1,unityes,unitno
will do unityes only if n1<0. Similarly, the command
do      n2,unityes,unitno
will do unityes only if n2<0. However, the command
do n1$and$n2,unityes,unitno
will do unityes if n1 and n2 are NOT zero. That is
if n1 is 2 and n2 is 3, the first command will not
be executed, nor will the second command,
but the form contating the $and$ will be executed.
This seems very inconsistent.

---------- response 1

The reason things like this are not implemented is
the heavy overhead in execution time paid. The condensing
process "reduces" unit names to pointers to tables and
the execution is consequently simple and fast. Permitting
"variables" on jumpouts does not imply the same enormous
overhead as other commands since one does not program
(should I say typically?) loops using jumpouts.

It has been pointed out that the -transfr- command does
not check that your "current copy" of your data structure
is in ecs before permitting you to move data from ecs to
central memory (this is only a problem if you have a
stoload/comload in effect, and have modified the loaded
data during this timeslice). I.e., you are allowed to
access something that is not your "current copy".

We intend to fix this by unloading your data to common/
storage, thus making the transfer from the "current" data.

This change may be detrimental to lessons which use
overlapping com/sto loads. Please contact me if you are
affected.

Apparently when you type a character after backspacing,
if it is put in the first ten character positions it
is displayed on the wrong line, and the output following
is fouled up. While this in itself is not too annoying,
similar things occasionally occur at arrows in actual
lessons when doing fancy things with back-space, etc.
Unfortunately, I can't remember a specific case of the
latter...
To a lot of people, this would look like a system bug,
and this is where such complaints usually go.........

---------- response 4
  01/22     17.44     midden       p

The problem is with margin returns.
The margin is set over from the left side of the screen with
an at command.
than a fancy writing bit goes on that ¬?moves the line all the way over.
And the routine that displays the stuff on the screen sees
that the backspace is 'out of range'( pass the margin)
and the correct computations are done to correct this.
Now that explains that.
This can not be fixed without causing serious problems.

Do the serious problems also prevent fix on the situation
where a student answer overflows the current line, goes to
the margin implied by the arrow. After the answer is judged
incorrect, if the student uses the erase key to erase the
last character or two, then replaces them, the erasure
sometimes misses the characters and the new characters
appear way to the left of the implied margin (but are judged
correctly as part of the original answer).?
Example 1200?3+20
0/4200
When the last 2 zeroes are erased (after judging) and
replaced with fives, the screen sometimes shows:?
1200?3+20

Science authors have had much difficulty in judging
3.7?10ˆ3 gram-mˆ2/sˆ2 (note units, and - means ?!)
It is proposed to handle the numrical factor separately
from the dimensionality:
define  student
units,kg,meter,sec $$ basic units
gram=.001kg,cm=.01meter,m=meter,day=86400sec,etc.
define  mine,student $$ include student define set
...
ansu 3.7 kg-mˆ2/sˆ2 $$ -  before unit means ?
...
This -ansu- (or -wrongu-) will match the response shown at
the top of the page, since both have a numerical value of
3.7, and a mass-length-time dimensionality of (1,2,-2).
Another response which would match is 37000 cmˆ2sec?ˆ-2Vkg.
But the response 3.7 or 3.7 kg will not match.

you don't know how many -put- commands that will eliminate.

would that flexibility be useful. please allow for
synonyms, eg.



define student
       units,(kilo,kilograms,kilogram,kg),......

the "conversion" factor portion should refer to all
synonyms as well, so specifying: gram=.001kg
also means g=.001kg, gram=.001kilogram......etc

  01/22     16.38     b sherwood       s

(Original note due to b sherwood despite name of golden...)

Yes, it is intended to have a synonym capability, altho
that will probably follow the other features.

Other features intended include
        storeu num,v101 $$ get number and dimension array
If the student says 230 gram/sec, the -storeu- will return
the value of 0.230 for num, and in array v101,v102,v103
the dimensions (1,0,-1) for mass,length,time. (This
assumes a "define units,kg,meter,sec".)

Also, there would be a "specs nounits" to allow a match   
to an -ansu- even if the student omits units. This is in
analogy to "specs noorder" to permit a match to an
-answer- even without the correct order.

You will be able to use units in a -calc-, but only the
numerical aspects of the unit will be used, not the
dimensions.

Your first and third example look fine, but the second

using a - to mean ?. I know physical units can be written

mathmatically very very bad. How about kg.mˆ2/sˆ2 ?

---------- response 6
  01/23     09.09     b sherwood       s

The question is not what would be a decent syntax, but
rather what syntax is in fact observed in textbooks,
journals, and student responses. We already attempt to
distinguish the minus from the dash in the -answer-
command, in that "12-5 dogs" is taken to mean "7 dogs",
whereas "7-dogs" is taken to mean "7 dogs". Since a
unit such as kg or meter is a very special thing, it
seems unavoidable to take a "-" preceding a unit as a
dash, not a minus sign. Sigh.......

Incidentally, there _is_ a philosophical problem. We could
teach and utilize a math syntax different from the
traditional one (APL syntax, for example), thruout TUTOR.
But this runs counter to the idea of sticking to "natural
language" and being able to teach traditional subjects
with PLATO.

We hope to ease the 1/2z ambiguity by introducing a
horizontal bar for division.....

I don't fully understand your question, but let me answer
some question anyway in the hopes that it was part of
yours!

The jumpout code will allow another lesson with the same
jumpout code to enter your lesson via a two-argument
-jumpout- command, even tho the two lessons have different
inspect and change codes. A stngle-argument -jumpout-
command (which takes you only to the beginning of a lessons)
will work as it always has, namely no code checks of any
kind are made. This is consistent with the fact that
you can enter _any_ lesson from the "choose a lesson to study"
page, but only the beginning, not the middle of the lesson.
 
There may be some changes in the two-argument -jumpout-
and the two-argument -restart- to make these mantpulations
simpler......

Could the jumpouts in AIDS be made for a "proceed at your

present system, where you cannot proceed at all... or at
least a list of the aids lessons and the info contained in
each so that an individual author can condense it "manually"
and thereby be able to at least look... The average time
spent in any 1 aids lesson by an author is short, usually

   A change in the way the back command functions will
be made this week-end and in effect as of Monday, Jan. 28.
Back will no longer initiate a help sequence--i.e., the
unit in which the back key was pressed will NOT be
remembered as the base unit. This means that next, next1,
back, and back1 all will function strictly as branching
type commands without changing anything else, and help,
help1, lab, lab1, data, and data1 will be the only keys
(commands) which initiate a help sequence.

Since someone indicated this change would affect them,
we would like to know the course(s) and students involved,

It is useful to keep course data as far as time on the
system goes for both authors and students; however, when
we use such data we should be careful to know the difference
between "serious" and "non-serious" usage. The usual
game-playing that at times takes place should not constitute
"serious" usage (admittedly, some of the games do). Also,
when a student forgets to "shift/stop" out of a lesson,
that time is not important for recording.
   For the moment, I feel that the important usage is when
a student uses a lesson that this instructor assigns him to
use. Of course authoring usage is also crucial. More
important than time on the system is what is being done
during that time.

This is an attractive idea, but the task of isolating

time for an author to peruse and listing them all could
turn out to be monstrous. In addition, it is difficult
to tell, except in the case where you know the author's
personality very well, exactly what his intentions
(constructive or recreational) are in entering a lot of 
lessons that are not out-and-out games nor the lesson
he is working on...

Could there be some commands(usable in a block

in the entire lesson,instead of just within a specific
block? I realize that individual blocks are generally
helpful while editing,but sometimes going into each
block and using X,C or U each time can be annoying
and slow..maybe a preceding letter could distinguish
these commands from regular block commands............

This was generally available at an earlier stage of PLATO
IV. It produces rapid sequences of disk accesses (one for
each block) and the trade-off in general system degredation
is not worth the advantages accrued to the individual user.

Note that search specifications are "remembered" between
blocks. Thus it is only necessary to go to another block
and press NEXT to have a previously specified search
repeated. Al Avner

   No, this will not be done; in order for our system to 
function there must be a "sharing" of the load between
humans and computer. The current block structure is
designed to help and encourage you to organize your
material. Allowing inter-block searching would soon
result in an inevitable entry into the 1st block and 
a search from there. The problem here is not one of
the programming to implement such a feature (if is trivial)
but one of providing a system which will continue to
function in the future. Both Paul Tenczar and myself
feel strongly on this point.

   A small problem you might wish to fix:?
When a new author or student signs on, chooses a password,
then continues on the system...
Then someone finds out about his signon and course (through
"site" for instance) and tries to sign on using that name
and course...?
He gets to choose a password, then kick off the first
person.?
Alternatives:?
1) Tell all new authors ¬+ students to choose their
passwords, then sign off, then sign on again.
2) When a new password is chosen, immediately return
it to the disk.
3) Check to see if records are being used _brfore_
checking if the password has yet been chosen.

A similar problem (but I don't know how bad it is):?
When a mutiple is signed on, he is told that help1
will allow him to change his password. I don't know what
happens if he tries it, but it's clear that he shouldn't
have the option. (He is _not_ told that he can change his

no...at present the STOP key aborts all output...this is
done very deep in the system and even _before_ the key is
passed on to the author's lesson for possible use in
pause or kstop commands.
the reasons for doing it this way are historical and
probably not valid anymore...I will try to have the thing
"re-thought"...but don't look for any quick solutions.
the programming effort is not worth the returns at this

     It is impossible to condense a lesson in the middle

(I have witnesses).  The reason why it is hard to condense
is quite clear.  As authors get deleted from their lessons
they try as soon as they can to get right back into their 
lesson. Many people are doing this and are tying up the
condenser. Can something be done about this situation?

Our new ECS should do something for this problem, at least

wait being due to other authors condensing, it is also
possible that an important system program was running and

  01/24     21.06     kane       phys

Concerning the handling of long write statements by service:

The editor (including SD/ID) allows for the generation of
full 120 character write statements.  Lesson service allows
only 108 characters (including the command field).








The problem comes when service (re)formats a write statement
of over 108 characters.  It doesn't put the 00's in correct-
ly to tell the editor (and the condenser) where the line
ends. So the next line in the program is "attached" to the
write statement.

When a lesson has an inspect code, the data page is

idea of being able to see the data page, even if a lesson
has an inspect code? (This might be implemented as an

When a lesson has an inspect code, the data page IS
available IF you have the inspect code word.
Similarly, if a lesson has no inspect code ("blank--
open to all"), the data page is also available.
At least, that's the way it is from site 14, staiton 21.

That's the point.... Prof. Friedman doesn't particularly

to see the data page to know who "owns" the lesson, the
topic, and the phone number. This information is not
available anywhere on the system if the lesson has an
inspect code.

The question: Are there objections to making this
information available?

The catalog lessons do not contain the lesson name (for a
good reason) so that it is not always possible knowing a
lesson name to find out who wrote it,?
The development of lesson sample gives a way of discovering
useful lessons by getting into them. If one could STOP1 out
of a lesson and get into the data page, it would simplify
finding the author. (Note that it would also reveal the
lesson name since that appears on the data page. This is not
a significant problem since most authors know how to find
the name of a lesson they are in.)?
I would vote for access to the data page regardless of the
codes.

All the information that is placed on the DATA pages by
the author is in the catalog lessons. It is from the DATA
pages that the catalog is constructed. In lesson -sample-
most lessons accessed have the author's name on the title
page, so that a user should be able to tell whose lesson
it is and where to contact the author. Anyone who thinks
filling out a DATA page is just for fun, should correct his
idea. Item 8, particularly, is copied verbatim from the DATA
page except in exceptional cases, so it behoves an author to
design an accurate description of his lesson. Also if anyone
changes his DATA page, he must inform me via NOTES because
system programmers have not yet been able to provide a flag
for us to detect changed DATA pages each week. We are trying
now to methodically go through listings of DATA page inform-
ation so as to update the catalog lessons,(cont)

(continued from previous note), but that is a long laborious
process even for two people working together. We are finding
extensive changes to DATA pages that have never been
reported. I believe that as long as we have the policy in
CERL of protecting the authors by not revealing the lesson
names, it is not in accordance with lab policy to have
DATA pages available unless you know the lesson names (and
inspect codes if required).
Users are SUPPOSED to obtain lesson names from the authors
when they get permission to use their lessons. The lessons
available through -sample- are supposed to be for your use
without having to know their names.
        In the future (a few months) there will be many
improvements to the catalog lessons and other new inform-
ation items available on the system. Until then, give us
ideas and bear with the present arrangements. Thanks. Tebby

I think you missed the point. It is not unknown for a
person to stumble upon a lesson, or to learn of one from
a student executing it in the same room. There are those
among us who would like to have the author's permission,
even though we could probably get away with not having it.
Therefore, It would only is of virtually no use to the
unscrupulous. It would only make it easier for the person
who wishes to use the lesson legally.

Unfortunately the terminal does not inform the computer

up with security. We may however sign people out if they

Incidentally, the newer terminals do send a special

Three problems in service:

   the screen, it is impossible to find out where you are by
   pressing f to get the fine grid position because pressing
   f moves the cursor back to a wherex of 504.?
2. Several times, I have had service tell me that the n'th
   command is unrecognizable (n>30) when I am trying to
   SS the rest of a block. If I move forward about 10 lines
   and SS the rest of the block, it works even though the
   command which gave the problem previously must be
   included. (I did this several times.) In any case it
   would be useful to know what the offending command is
   (and have the potential to bypass it although this would
   be more difficult than in SD i presume.)?

The example you requested is in lesson: taxon, block: p10
(currently located at +j). If you SS400 at the top of the
block, it says stmt -$32 not recognized. (I think that it
points to the following command:?
write $1071?
which appears perfectly legal.) If you go back to taxon and
move forward 10 lines in block +j, then SS400, you get
stmt ¬$42 not recognized. It is obviously getting past the
previous problem. (It also displays the '$1071'.)?
About the shrinking, it would be very convenient for
changing the size of displays including text to fit in
with other material on the screen, but I would not classify
it as essential or anything like that.

1. When writing and debugging a program with randomization,
it is sometimes useful to be able to check it out with
the same sequence of random numbers.?
2. More importantly, some instructors might wish to be able
to have each of their students get the same numbers when
attacking the same problem--when, in fact, that problem
is set up to give each student a different set of numbers 
developed as a random process. The same numbers would be
useful for some auxiliary discussion of the problem.

We (john long, gary michael, and myself) have put together

not only supply the seed, but can specify the mean and
standard deviation of the output. Also this can be used
for floating point numbers above 1, and for number ranges
other than 0-1 or 1-whatever in integer. You can access it
by a simple do, and then pull the results in whatever way
you like...........Yes, it is repeatable.

Suggestions:
1. Remove the limit on levels of nesting. Set up the pop-up
stacker so that the higher levels are pushed out the bottom
(retaining the main unit for use with *exit* command with
no tag). Thus the error would come if we tried to go all
the way back along the chain. This would require the 
programmer to use the *exit* command to get back to his
base unit, but would still make some things much simpler.?
2. Set up some sequencing command which works on the value
of a variable (like jumpout). If it takes a lot of overhead,
ration its use like press. (It would almost have to be more
efficient than some of the convolutions I am going through
to maintain my pointers.)

I was putting stuff into a new lesson and a strange thing
happened. First let me tell you what I did before the 
strange thing happened.
   First I edited block a. Let's call that which I put in
block a "(a)". Next I started block b and put some lines
in there. Call the contents of block b "(b)".
Next I started a charset which went into blocks c and d.
    That was when the strange thing happened. After I
started the charset, I found, much to my dismay, that block
a was empty, block b held the original contents of b ((b)),
and block c held the original contents of block a ((a)).
The charset, of course, was now located in blocks d and e.
     My question is the following -- Is " reordering" just
a mis-spelling of "reversing"? That is my question.

PS -- I really like all those new print options.

Michael probably has the answer to your question. This
sort of thing is unlikely to happen during the day when
the ECS is normally full (or nearly so) so that as soon
as a common is no longer in use, it is sent back to 
disk.

        The computer does not bother to "delete" lessons
or return common from ECS unless space is needed. This 
also means that if you want a new copy of the lesson you
are editting late at night it is important to do a STOP1
condense from edit mode rather than choosing the lesson
on the "choose a lesson page".

It should be pointed out that typing "common" on the
"choose a lesson" page does not result in your common
being removed from ecs--it merely allows you to have the 
current contents copied to disk at your request (there
are checks to prevent the worst abuses of this).

The only way to actually get rid of the ecs copy of your
common is to execute an "abort common" command in your
lesson.

return... since I wanted the common returned, I tried
again. Much to my surprise and bewilderment, I was told
that I had been returning common too often (granted, this
should occur when a legitimate (sp) attempt at abuse occurs)
but I was not able to actually return the common until
the mandatory wait of however long had lapsed. (the second

Disc space is tight, but judging from some of the studies

efficient and effective lessons -- and thus _saving_ disc

So, it seems to me that the article is of legitimate

In addition to the new terminals added to the system and 
the late arrival of more ECS, I think that perhaps
the router lesson feature is helping to clobber ECS.
I imagine there are many router lessons that could be
suspended after the student has been routed without 
any need to hold the lesson in ECS. When the student
STOP1's he would then not be sent to the finish unit
of the router, But the router should be held until there
is a _successful_ jumpout. My router is currently like
this......Consequently I would like to see the following
command inplemented:
       router         expression,^o^f^f===?o?n ,name
EFFECT: turns off/on 'post' routing for the named student

it would seem to me that this would negate all of the
other benefits of the router; e.g. control over the
students after errors, routing after successful completion
of a certain part of a particular lesson, etc.
if the router has to be condensed when a student wants
(or has) to return for routing. how is this to be provided
for with the present shortage of ECS.
and since the router counts only once at a site, (and most
of them appear to be rather small--<1k) it seems unlikely
that this change would really ease the shortage.

---------- response 4

I think you have 3 questions here:
        1) I'd be willing to forego those benefits if it
will in any way increase the chances that the student can
jumpout to the lesson he wants.
        2) The fact remains that if the feature were
added, it would be possible to route students to lessons
(without error recovery except for fatal condense and
excess memory use). There would be no need to recondense the
router until the student signed on again. In fact, other
than error recovery, the things that can be accomplished
by holding a router in ECS could be done at the next signon
when the student goes through the router again. There are
not that many cases where there is a need to hold it and
tie up ECS.......but for them, one need only .....

only 46K allocated to our site, its easy for 5 or 10
students from different courses to tie up significant
percentages of that ECS. I frequently cannot sign on during
prime time. But most important.....the students after
trying over and over to get on and into the router
frequently can't get to the lesson they want because of
'memory allocation exceeded'. If I don't do something
soon they might get frustrated with things. I feel this
command would help because it allows the router ECS to
be 'recycled' to the jumpout lesson for those who need it
badly.

I second the notion of a method for removing a router
lesson from ECS if it is no longer needed. In my course,
the router feature is used (in lesson mastery) solely
to prevent students from escaping the sequence and
messing up the restart commands.
My router (mastery) is actually part 1 of a 3-part
lesson, and uses about 3200 words of ECS. It could be
removed from ECS at any time students are in any
of the other two parts, and there is no pressing
need for it to be on ths system during those times.
An option to "decondense" the router on certain
jumpouts would be quite helpful.

---------- response 7
  01/28     13.58     judy       pso

If you want them "decondensed" you shouldn't be using a 
router. The whole point of using a router is that it _will_
remain in ECS.

Any router that uses 3200 words merely to protect restarts
is not written properly. Perhaps that 3-part lesson should
be split into 3 one-part lessons?

The student who is sent through a router should never
see "memory allocation exceeded". Obviously, sometimes
a jumpout will fail because of ECS, but he should be sent
to a unit which gives a sensible reply.

As for 5 or 10 students tying up all of 46k of memory,
there is no solution except insisting that students come
at scheduled times in groups. PLATO cannot at this time
(nor in the near future) support cafeteria-style education.

---------- response 8
  01/28     14.10     judy       pso

The two basic functions of a router are:

1)  Throw the student back to his restart lesson, or to
    the next lesson in the sequence. That should demand 
    no more than a couple of units, possibly 200 words.
  
2)  Offer an index page for jumpouts to various lessons
    and provide error messages. I have never seen an
    index page(s) take up more than 1000 words.
 
If it includes a lot of text, draws pictures, does answer
judging, then it doesn't belong in your router.

One problem we are all facing is not being able to afford
a whole lesson space just for the 1 (possibly 2) blocks of
a router lesson. Remember, those other blocks can be used
for character sets, micros, and common.

2. I guess I wouldn't have any objection if such a facility

3. But the biggest question I have is the need for routers
of lengths approaching 2600 or 3200 words for simple tasks
like controlling restart units. Our router controls restart,
has course indexes for 2 courses involving about 40 lessons,
and takes care of errors, etc. all in about 600 words. How

I't really rike to have a small router lesson. But I cannot

router: A Graphics Demonstration, A Demonstration Index,
Course Index for IPPH 362-3, Course Index for MDCH 204-205,
Jumpouts to other Course Indexs, A Quiz Calculator, A
Contact Hours Calculator, and other items. Unfortunately
There is no way I can conditionaly condense these things
relative to the time of day or relative to who it is who
is trying to access the lesson. The lesson is used by
students, authors, and multiples, at various times. If
I wanted to be cute and had another lesson space,
I could cram our routing into a couple hundred words.....
That is NOT the problem.

Furthermore:
      Any student who runs my router and gets an excess

      There was an error in the lesson that you were
running or attempting to run. Please notify Steve Deiss
and remember what type error it was.

        The computer does not have room for the lesson
you wish to run. Stated more cryptically, logical site 0

allocated. You do not need to report this error. Just
press next and try again. Eventually you will get into

(I was entering my previous response concurrently with
Judy's, so great minds work alike or something to that
effect.)
Anyway to make some I hope constructive suggestions for
reducing the size of the router relative to the problem
of lack of lesson space, how about using *use* commands
from some of your other lessons. Particularly if the
routines you mention are independent, they could each
be used by different 1-part lessons without any of the
lessons becoming excessively large. This would allow you to
reduce the size of the router while accessing the rest of
the lesson space in the router space.
  
---------- response 13

In this particular case I think 'use' is useless. Its
like suggesting that all the routines in lesson calc
be spread out and 'use'd by all the physics lessons
when you have no way of knowing beforehand when their
use will be necessary. I think a better idea would be
for the staff to implement a disk allocation scheme
that allows lessons as small as 1 block or as big as
any multiple of a block in size. Then I could split
my lesson into the logically distinct routines that it
is comprised of - each as a separate lesson. But, behold
I don't see the reason for all these questions??? If someone
is willing to release some ECS after a jumpout, why not let
them? When large numbers of courses are in ECS.....the
routers are bound to burn up a considerable portion of ECS
even though a student will hit it only on the way to some-

sized low-cost use, which was partly achieved by having
large sharing of resources (many students in one lesson).
Thus, it has always been to your advantage to _not_ attempt
to give each student a little of this or a little of that.

Your request for throwing out your router lesson so that
the student can get into the next lesson implies that you
are probably using your router lesson in a way that most
certainly was not intended. Please read Judy's descriptions
carefully...

Why do you want "warn" users that they must have
data turned on? If random users wander into your lesson
the data you collect from them is essentially without
value, since you do not know their context. Also,
you will not see data logged in the datafile attached
to their course. So what is it you are trying to do?

If I have a unit that -transfr-s things around on the
basis of some variable tags, I must either make a special
check each time for legnth = 0 or else always transfer 1
extra word.

But suppose that I want the last word in student bank.
Now my -transfr- command always carries the additional
overhead of making sure that my fudge factor of 1 does
not carry me beyond the boundaries of student bank.

Why not an option to find somebody on the system?
The site page is OK as far as it goes, but if someone I want
to seek out (not necessarily talk to ) is off my site, I
 have to:
a) wander all over the campus
or
b) unnecessarily bother him/her with the talk option
This option could be designed along the links of the presenttalk/ext option so that it would not necessarily give the
site/staion info. Even the talk option does not allow you
to see where the person in question is..... but in all

I would like to know why I was deleted from a lesson as

1. It was 8 pm and there is usually no problem with total 
   ECS.?
2. More importantly, I went immediately to site and found
   that the site was more than 20000 words under allocation
   While, it is possible for that many lessons to leave
   voluntarily in less than five seconds, I seriously
   doubt it. (The lesson I was in was only about 1500.)

---------- response 2

If they did, they weren't authorized to, since the next
thing I looked at after site was the courses of the
authors who should have anything to do with that lesson.
I was the only author in any of those courses. Also I
went back from student mode to the same lesson fairly
rapidly and found that the lesson required condensing.
It was probably an isolated ocurrence of some strange
coincidence. I reported it mainly to find out whether
there was some quick explanation some systems person
could give or whether it was happening to someone else.

I'm willing to bet there are oddities in the deletion
routines (undoubtedly because it's fundamentally imposs-
ible to test without a full site). We've had many (meaning
about once or twice a week) cases where authors were
testing lessons, any one of which, when bumped, would
have allowed students to run, but the students could not
get in. Authors could bump other authors, but students

add to that the fact that in many cases after deletion of
a lesson, one can get back into it without recondensing
and without other people being in the lesson.
PS: I'd appreciate a report on the ECS allocation
    strategy, from a system point of view.
    For reasons of system analysis (allocation algorithms
    are a research topic in computer science) questions

As you probably know, we got another 1/2 million words of
ECS a few weeks ago. Engineers from Control Data Corp.
worked until early this morning trying to get it to run
without errors. Since it has been running fine for a few
hours, we (David Andersen and myself) thought that it would
be safe to give every site their portion of the extra, un-
allotted ECS. This is only temporary, though...I am sure
that within the next few days Bill Golden will be giving
the ECS out in a different manner (like adding logical
sites). These larger site allocations will return to normal
as soon as PLATO goes down.

i see, so we really dont have any more additional ecs
for each site per se, but have just added more terminals
and hence more sites and ecs will be needed to keep
everyone at the same level as they are now. Is that
an accurate perception of the situation?

---------- response 3

Well....better let Bill Golden answer that...there may be
a little bit more per terminal, but that may very according
to site and Bill. You are correct, though, that we are
getting many more terminals hooked up and much of the new
ECS will have to be used to accomodate these terminals.

        Both new sites and more ECS per terminal will come
from the new half-million words. Sites will average 1500
words per terminal. Logical site 5 has about 45 terminals,

I gather you do not think I know what I am doing with a 
router lesson. I think you are wrong, but I will temporarily 
remove the station restriction on my router so you can try 
it. Try it as student 'temp' in course 'pharmacy' to see
how it routes. To see its demo/utility features run it
in author mode as lesson 'primer' (password='demo'). This
should show that there are not too many 'bells and whistles' 
in the routing part of the lesson. It will also become clear 
that the demo/util part should be in a separate lesson, and
it will be when we get the space. The inspect code is 'look' 
if you want to see how it is written.
        Now that my head is on the block I'd like to point 
out that it is incorrect to assume that a router should 
never get big. It should be obvious that 't0 route' is a

could easily become quite large if it attempts to make
much use of the individual differences recordable in
student, common, and router variables. My router does not
yet. We are all just beginning to explore the potential
of routers. But it seems that in many cases most routing 
can be done on entry to the router without the need to save
it in ECS. If someone has a justifiably large router with
a lot of routing calcs, they may do themselves and their   
site neighbors a favor by releasing it from ECS until the

Indeed, the "intelligent" routers used by the elementary

amount of space, Judy.

Your idea that a router "should take the student to the
next lesson in a sequence" is correct, but one does that
in a couple of hundred words only if the sequence is
linear. And if all optimal learning sequences are

---------- response 5
  01/29     23.12     john r       r1

As I understand it:

(a) a router overrides restart commands and thus a router-
   type lesson is needed even for a simple index

(b) Deiss's router is large because he is constrained by
   lack of disk space to put regular materials in it

(c) <unrelated to b> very simple routers of the type
   described in (a) might not need to be resident -

If seems clear that routers doing their thing
(routing) may well get large. However, as was
pointed out before, it is a simple matter to
put demo materials in some lesson other than
the router, via -use- commands...i.e. the demo
materials may reside in the router, but not be
condensed as part of the router, but as part of
any lesson where a very few words of disk space
are available for the necessary -use- commands.

---------- response 7
  01/30     09.21     deiss       pharmacy
I need the router so that I can allow the student to
override restart commands, rather than having to sign up
for me to do it manually. It has also been very useful
for error recovery messages, and for providing a place to
go after an and lesson. But we could live without these
later items. I suspect we will also be using it to get
around the lack of individual records for individual student
s. (What the router really does, is it allows an author
to write his own version of lesson plato for _his_ students
in order to get around some automatic feature of the
system plato lesson ....apparantly that was easier than
trying to rewrite plato for everyone's whim.)

Well, if everthing we want to have in our "guide" lesson
were in a router lesson, it might be the biggest router
lesson in the system. We recognize that is impractical,
given the available ecs, and currently are thinking in
terms of a compromise: The router will be small; it
will jumpout to the guide to allow the student to " talk
over" his needs; the guide will return to the router with
a choice made. The router then becomes merely a switching
center between the (very complex) lesson¬chooser (the
"guide" itself) and the ordinary lessons.?
None of this router has been coded' to my knowledge'
although much work is in progress on the "guide".

I am wondering whether there would be some
hardcopy reports on the following questions:
(1) what ECS-allocation-algorithms are used on PLATO?
    what governs the selection of a lesson to be deleted?
    what are the experiences with a 'working set' of
    lessons, i.e., with the removal of a series of
    deletes and recondenses.
(2) where are the bottlenecks in PLATO now?
    can more terminals be supported, with or without
    degradation of response time and of computer time
    per user?
Both of the above seem to be of some general interest,
not only from an author point of view, but also from
the point of view of 'experiences with a large on-line

1--ECS allocation schemes change from time to time in
response to needs as we try to allocate scarce resources
fairly.

2--We will presumably run out of cpu capability before
we run out of anything else. This is in contrast to
normal systems that first run out of swapping capability,
which however sometimes appears as cpu problems due to
thrashing of the cpu trying to decide what to do. On our
system the system overhead is a fixed or declining (!)
percentage of total processing as the load goes up, whereas
on normal systems the overhead percentage increases as
the load increases.

Personal notes should be forwarded to lesson pad, which
was designed expressly to keep such items out of notes.
It has provisions for protecting a note from deletion
(up to 12, or 24 hours) and a provision for password-
protected notes (although it is highly recommended that
classified info not be included in these notes...)
plus storage for up to 3 replies, and multitudes of other
nice options..... Mike Carroll of Purdue Ft. Wayne

In view of emily's current decrepitude, it would seem
advisable to minimize disk accesses to emily. Now whenever
a person comes into an emily lesson whose code is already
in ecs but has a charset, the charset must be loaded, re-
quiring a disk access. If such charsets (particularly short
ones, ie moonwer) could be formatted into scource code,
using the -char- and -define- commands, these disk accesses
would not be necessary. The charsets would be stored in ecs
with the rest of the program. They would take up no more
room in a lesson than a charset block does. Lesson oldchess
stores the chess characters this way. The reduction in
emily's workload ought to improve her health, and increase
her availability.

Cutting down disk accesses by, maybe, 1; won't help
the disk drive or the disk pack...in other words, pack
emily doesn't go off for a tune-up every hundred thousand
disk accesses. It goes off when any one of the six disk
drives we have decides to quit working. So, if you want to
save pack emily, you are going to have to keep all the
drives in working order...but I don't know how that can be
done. We have 6 disk drives...one is supposed to be a
spare, so that when something goes wrong with another drive,
no packs have to go off. But we also have six disk packs,
which means our spare is only a spare when emily isn't on.

And charsets constructed with char commands save space
only in certain cases -- when the charset is fairly small.
But char commands take up more room in ECS, and they
are harder to "edit".

For that matter, how about a system response to note ¬$219??
These notes are supposed to communicate, not just among
plato users, but with system people. It's getting to be
_frequently_ necessary to bug you to get a reply. How about	
it, please? We usually make our suggestions with serious
intent; it's highly annoying, in fact insulting, to be
ignored.

1) David Frankel has fixed the editor "T" option, but
the new version has not been read in yet. He is
expected to announce the change--at least by the time
that he is sure that it is working. In this instance,
a "work in progress" reply to note 185 would have been
appropriate (or did he in fact leave a note?).

2) The question of seeing other author's data pages is
very sticky--there are authors who only want to have
their work recognized after they are ready to "publish"
it. There may be ways to make everybody happy--but
we really don't have time to worry about it right now.

Which leads me to the last question--you are wrong to assume
that notes is for instant communication, and you are wrong 
to assume that your notes are being ignored.

It often takes a good deal of research into the facts before
a system reply can be made--and many times you have come
back to "bug" us before the note has been given any atten-
tion! Remember that with all of these queries, it takes
some time for us to clear up the current work, and then
catch up on notes again.

It has been suggested that we could at least reply "looking
at this"--and perhaps we should do this more systematically.
I think the reason we don't do this more often is simply
that with a little more effort we can find the answer --
it is all the little efforts that  add up to at least a
day's delay, however.

At the first meeting on data collection (last fall), it

probably be a while before it was available. It is
somewhat disconcerting to be told 6 months later that
no such thing is under consideration!!?
Another tag that I haven't seen tied is the note last
summer that a system feature was going to be implemented
in the " near future"  that would allow easy storage of
student responses to early arrows  in a unit. These responses
to be reinserted as responses to the same arrows upon

re: inserting a previous reply as the response to a
subsequently encountered arrow.
One fairly quick approach is to store the response in
the student variables and use the copy key appropriately.
(Cscomments has an example of this --when the student wants
to correct a previously entered line of his comment, the
arrow is "re-opened" by filling the judge buffer with his
previous response. The code which accomplishes this is
in block comment1 and comment2 of the lesson.)
Hope this is helpful.(I have assumed that your use of
press was to enter one key of the previous response at a
time. The above scheme requires only one-press --of the
copy key.) Of course, the above does not solve the storage
space problem.

Before someone says "Use service", ID is more convenient 
at times because it is faster (80th in displaying and in 
getting into it) and primarily because there is no "insert" 
option for service. In order to SS. you have to have part 
of the display already in... 
 I will readily  admit that more most cases service is 
definitely superior  , however, service handles some things 
(like arcs, for example) differently, so we cannot simply 
assunme that SD/ID is useless.

Two questions concerning efficiency (both cpu time and ECS)
of the new *doto* and *branch*  features:? 
1. In places where we have in the past used *do* for 
   iteration through a sequence of commands, what would
   be the effect on efficiency of moving those commands
   into the unit and using *doto*?? 
2. Similarly, what would be the effect of including in the 
   main unit the commands which are currently referenced by 
   conditional *do* statement. The idea would be to use 
   *branch* to branch around them if they were not needed. 
   This could be very effective in those places where we 
   have essentially had to do logical checks by a series 
   of conditional *do*s.?

It occasionally makes for more typing. but that would be 
worth it just for the ability to see which blocks were 
partialled in AFTER hitting. I don't believe I could count 
the times when I have wanted to change the condense  on one 
block, but forgotten which blocks were condensed. It also 
makes hitting the 'p'  key accidentally (or because  the

17 bit quantites were handled correctly).

The value of noslide (the constant you use with the slide
command to turn the projector off) has been changed to
01400 (from 01000) so that it doesn't produce a click
every time it is used. Also, the E option is back...
if anything suspicious happens when you use it, PLEASE

The slide noslide still turns off the projector and

a "function" that ors o1000 with the current slide ¬$?
This would eliminate the unnecessary clunking.

Typing charset on the choose-a-lesson-to-edit page

containing the charset, entering the block, and
selecting the load option. (Same goes for micro.)?

still needed if there is an inspect code on the lesson.

The difference is that "ACCESS-shift-7" gives a vertical

the default micro table does not have shift-7 in it. This
is associated with some cleanup going on relative to new

---------- note 32 jump-code
  01/31     15.02     b sherwood       s

The use of jumpout security codes on lessons will be
delayed to 5:00 pm, February 8, to make it easier for
people to test this new feature (on a weekend).

You may leave your lesson jumpout security code blank
unless
        1) You have a sensitive part of the lesson,
           such as a part that sets variables into
           common.
        2) You are worried that someone might -jumpout-
           past your title page, thus missing your
           credit line.

Having a non-blank jumpout code on your lesson will
prevent lessons which do not share that code from
doing a -jumpout- into the middle of the lesson.
(It will however continue to be legal to do a one-argument
-jumpout-, which goes to the beginning of the lesson.)

---------- response 1
  01/31     15.19     b sherwood       s

There is a present problem with two-argument -jumpout-
or -restart- commands. A student signing in thru a
router lesson needs to be able to be passed right thru
into the middle of the lesson he left yesterday. But
presently the only way to do that is with a
        jumpout rstartl, rstartu
which requires that router and routee lessons must have
matching codes (presently inspect codes--later will be
jumpout codes). It is proposed that there be an option
        jumpout resume
which uses whatever restart info has been set for this
student. Moreover, executing a two-argument restart
statement, or setting a unit name by hand into the
student's course registration record, would set a flag
to require some special machinery if there is a jumpout
code on the lesson.

---------- response 2
  01/31     15.27     b sherwood       s

There are two cases: if the student comes in thru a
router, and that flag is set, the jumpout codes must
match (or the routee lesson must have a blank jumpout
code); if he tries to sign in directly, he cannot get
into the lesson unless it has a blank jumpout code.

For normal cases (lessons with blank jumpout codes, or
one-argument -restart- commands) there would then be no
special equipment necessary.

But a lesson with a jumpout code and the flag set could
not be signed into unless that restart unit was listed
in some super-special, little-used "entrance" command.

The point is, if a lesson specifies a starting point, by
executing a one-argument -restart-, a student should of
course be able to restart there (by sign-on, or by
jumpout resume from a router). Two-argument -jumpout-
and -restart- commands should nearly disappear, except for
lessons authored by a compact group.

Thank you! This will solve the problems we have
encountered trying to enable classes at 3 other
schools to use our lessons, as well as their own and
other peoples', with their routers. Playing musical
codes becomes very difficult when 5 or 6 authors at
different places are involved. This sounds like a
simple and viable solution to the problem.

---------- response 4
  01/31     20.50     b sherwood       s

Note carefully that if a lesson has a non-blank jumpout
code you will not be able to set up a student's records
by hand to sign him into that lesson! Authors must come
to realize that setting unit names by hand may sort of
work for handling a few test students, but use of such
lessons by instructors at other institutions is
impractical. Lessons should be structured to contain
indexes that are student-accessible, or other forms
developed that make lessons viable when used by someone
other than the author, who happens to know the main
unit names........

It would seem that there is still some need for another
form of the jumpout,use, and common commands. Something
along the lines of:
use     lessonname,blockname,(codeword)

Thereby allowing almost total freedom with regards as to
what lessons can be interconnected with which.

---------- response 6
  02/03     21.15     schreiner       uimatha

I find this last idea very useful ---
   the jumpout (restart, use, common, ...)
   commands request a service, and they only should
   provided all information to get it.

But: the editor will upon inspection show the codeword
within the command.

Alternative seems to be that a lesson has/may have
a code area, set up from the data page of the lesson,
and very similar to a read only common, in which such
code words could be stored and then referenced very
much like variables.

The advantage of this code word area would be that
intersections of lesson-sets can be freely constructed,
without having the same jumpout codes all over.

Are you supposed to have difficulty in replacing text
when the line being replaced follows a line which uses
CR to write several lines in one write? What I mean
is, the line being replaced looks like this in the block:

3 write    a
           b
4 this     (line to be replaced)

in replace mode, looks like this: (after R4)

write    a
?(arrow) b
such that if you type anything it overwrites line "b"
In addition, it doesn't seem to make any difference
how many times the line above was CR'd, the replace
overwrites the last line.
In any case,it makes it difficult to edit long draw and
write statements.

Ive had similar problems--some characters used 2 ¬+ 3 CRs
and overwrote 1 or 2 lines while replacing lines. A simple
solution is to insert about 3 lines after the -write- w/ the
CR, each inserted line containing only a '*' (comment).
Thisll give you a good buffer for editing. TomL

---------- response 2
  01/31     20.52     b sherwood       s

In fact, except for very special circumstances, avoid
using CR--use a continued -write- statement instead.
Some of us are puzzled by the fascination some authors
find in the CR option.

It can save you 1 word per CR, but the hassle involved

Situation: in order to conserve storage, character strings
are to be packed into contiguous character positions in a
"string area" in memory (i.e. a given string may not start
on a word boundary, but in the middle of a 60 bit word).
Problem: how can these strings be stored into and displayed
from memory?
Solution: use "storea" to enter the input string into a
buffer which does begin on a word boundary, then use "move"
to put the string into the string storage area. Reverse the
process using "move" and "showa" to display the string.
Better solution: "storea" the string directly into the
string area in memory, and "showa" it directly from that
area.
Question: is there any possibility of implementing the
better solution above -- in particular will we ever be
allowed to "storea" and "showa" using segmented variables --
or is some other solution possible?

Well, if you just want to show the contents of a segmented

a segmented variable of any length. -do-ing a series of
these allows the -showa-ing of more than one segmented
variable rather easily, without using buffers.

I was playing with -edit-, and noticed that if the student
response spills over into n150, it kills the buffer. The
response is not saved, just as if the response were too
long. I noted this in a test where I said "edit n148",
then typed some stuff. If it fit into n148 and n149, fine,
and everything worked. But typing over 20 characters caused
all variables to be left zeroed, and pressing the -EDIT- key
killed the response for good. "edit n150" doesn't do
diddle.

The actual code is more complex, and the illustrative
code above behaves as it should. But in the real case
a branch to 2 taken before the doto is encountered causes
some of the intervening code to be executed. A branch
to 3 keeps this from happening.

I'll have to guide you through it, though.

Branches into a doto loop are at times quite helpful
however it would be nice to know just how the doto operates,
inorder to avoid abiguous results. I would not like the
idea of having a condense error occur on such branches as
it would tend to reduce the flexibility of the command.

Well, my name isn't David either, but may I suggest that,
at the very least, you shouldn't branch into the range of a
doto loop without giving a value to the variable used as
loop index (n2 in the original example).

---------- reponse 8
  02/04     11.35     john r       r1

The point is that if you didn't write the command you
don't know how it funtions. It is conceivable, for
example, that the return branch is not planted at the
statement label until the doto is encountered. Only DMA
knows for sure, and intelligent speculation by others
merely propogates possible misinformation.

At first it sounded like a good idea, but on second thought,

There are ways you can distinguish between -10^-^1^0 and 0.

If -10^-^1^0 (and presumably 10^-^1^0) were set =0 for sqrts and
other functions, the 14 digit accuracy of the machine would
be severely hampered.

The writeup of the showa command indicates that "showa loc,

Question: will the use of a segmented variable for -loc-

        Tests have shown that the use of a segmented
variables is illegal with storea, and segmented variable
used with showa leads to very unexpeced results (eg. given
"abcdefghij" in nc1, segment chars=nc1,6: showa chars(1),1

I was talking to David Andersen about this problem yestderday

---------- response 2
  02/05     13.33     frankel       p

Here's the reason it works this way...
        When you say showa n1,1 it shows the
        character that is at the top of the word (in the
        top 6 bits). When you say showa segment(1),1
        PLATO turns the 6-bit segment into a full 60
        bit word, and places the contents of the segment
        in the _bottom_ 6 bits, with the top 54 bits all
        0. So now the showa routine shows only the top
        6 bits, because it operates within the computer
        only on 60-bit words, and the top 6 bits are
        0, so it shows nothing.

I have no idea how David Andersen is going to fix this,
but if he says he will, I guess he will.

To facilitate exchange of info:
What are the feelings on allowing easy examination of lessons
(e.g. straight from catalog via the code number) by authors.
No lesson names would be divulged and they couldn't be used
by students. BUT- this would allow authors in a subject area
to easily see what has been done or is being done. By
restricting which course can get into your lesson you could
easily prevent this inspection if you so desired (at a cost
of maybe 6-8 words in your i.e..u.).
Hopefully this would facilitate communication and decrease
overlap with higher exportability of lessons. You would
only need to trace the authors of lessons potentially useful
In my opinion this would be a help to authors (ie me) in
biology.

  It is difficult to write a 1-line description of a lesson
which gives a useful indication of the lesson contents.
Perhaps if the lesson description for lessons which are
in a "finished" state and available for student use could
be expanded a little, it would make catalog easier to use
while still allowing authors the option of permitting
only selective use of their lessons. (I have to admit --

     The following clarification should be made in the
"common" write-up in aids: Even if you use "comload"
commands to load/unload your common buffer area, if the
declared common length -<1500 words, then the system will
automatically load/unload the common until the first
"comload" command is executed. This is useful if you
are using "storage" and "stoload" commands along with
common---be careful not to have a stoload command overwrite
part of the common that is being "automatically"loaded
when the lesson first begins.

the name list is plotting; however, the new terminals
appear to accept all keypresses while the names are

is there anyway to allow the pressing of (at least)

You may have a problem with a keyset not responding properly
--which you should be able to verify in other lessons.
I find that records behaves nicely right now; what time of
day was it? Had you been executing a lesson with lots of
cpu use? Any other symptoms?

---------- response 4
  02/06     13.54     shlosberg       com

the poor response seems to have nothing to do with the
amount of processing done, and the function keys seem to
respond well in all other lessons, but to get a back or
next to be accepted while names are being written in
our course, approx. 50 lbs. of pressure is needed.
perhaps it is our keysets, but why does it only happen
in course records?

---------- response 5
  02/06     16.10     friedman       csa

I have also noticed that when in records, one must now
wait while the list of names appears until the page is
almost complete, before a NEXT, BACK, or what-have-you
will be accepted. I don't think it has anything to do
with old vs. new keysets, or with sensitive vs. insensitive
keyboards. I wonder if (a) there is a -catchup- in the
records lesson; or (b) it takes more than one timeslice
to plot a full page. Either would, I think, produce the
effect described.?
By the way, the above was not the case prior to the
addition of some new features to records, including
(if I remember correctly) the message feature.
(But I'm certainly not complaining about the new features!)

It might be useful to have students give a quick and easy
evaluation of a lesson they have just completed and to
make this evaluation on-line, in the router lesson.
We need more feedback on individual lessons from people
using our lessons throughout the plato network; this
feedback should not only be from "course data" but should
include student's "affective" input. If this info could
be stored in router (from which student got to lesson),
authors would have easier access to the information.
If the router is not the answer, perhaps another on-line
way could be recommended.

Look for unit "comment" in lesson mastery. This unit
is used in conjunction with student data collection.
It is in block c, "utilities" (I think) of lesson mastery.
This lesson has no inspect code in author mode.
To see it in use in student mode, go in as "demo" in course
"tutoring" (to turn data on), then when you are there,
press TERM and type "comment".
If you do not have student data collection, the comment
unit can be altered to store in router variables by
means of a transfr command. (But data collection is much
easier!)
Students would have to be in the course (with data
collection turned on) for this arrangement to work.
If this is unacceptable, you can look in lesson library
to see how to construct a "Current Comments" block
such as is used to store comments in may lessons.

to pack many multi-choice responses in a single word of

   I guess it should simply be expected EVERY night for
the near future (that way you can consider it a bonus
when there isn't any testing). The "guaranteed" hours
of operation for the system are 8 (maybe 7?) a.m. until
10 p.m. System testing has always had priority on the
remaining time--the difference now is that testing of
new hardware requires dedication of the entire machine
at this time whereas the usual software changes typically
require only brief interruptions.
   I have personally posted notices early in the evening
when I have seen no notice and found out that testing was
scheduled later--otherwise your notification would be
coming right at 10 p.m. that the system was going off for
a few hours.

file "a" using charsets in files "b" + "c", and remain in
"a" but have the chars loaded from another file without
backing out and entering another file. Something like
the copyblock option but loading the terminal rather than
transferring a bunch of code. This'd be convenient (if its

of some other lesson in my curriculum and pressed LAB so
as to go in inspect mode. Then I looked at some charsets
and was informed before I looked at them that I could only
inspect them, inspected to my heart's content, and backed
out to the choose a lesson page. I repeated this process
for two or three more charsets then went back into my file.
Then I went into the block containing my charsets and
used the NEXT option to reload them. While editing I noticed
things were not as they should be and when I looked at my

I had just looked at. Detailed enough?

Things like that have happened to me several times on a

which is set to -1 if charset loading fails. Thus, if you
do a conditional jump to the unit where charset loading
command is, on error=-1, you may avoid garbage-writing.

     I never condensed the lesson. I loaded the terminal
while in author mode (when you go into the charset block
you have the option of pressing -NEXT- to load the
characters into the terminal) and noticed the problem while
still editing. Looking at the character directery I found
my characters were destroyed and the others had replaced
them. As there were only a few in there to begin with I
simply replaced them.

---------- response 6

Unfortunately, we do not (yet) have the check in the
editor to tell you that you did _not_ succeed in loading
your character set (check on error¬=0). Thus, it is very
difficult to tell whether this is what happened to you
(in which case you will see whatever was there before),
or whether your terminal is acting up. (Since you have
"corrected" the supposedly bad ones, I no longer have
any evidence that they were bad...) If you have a
reproducible phemomenon at one terminal, it may well
disappear at another terminal--and the terminal is in
need of repair.

Does anyone out there have experience with checking
the error flag on charset readins? Do you catch an error
often? ever?
Additional info from dma:
     error=-1 if charset not found
     error=-2 if stop key pressed during loading
     error=-3 for peculiar system errors

A couple of "small" points:?
1. Is there some reason why the limit on the *move* command
   is set at 1500, or is it really arbitrary? If it is
   arbitrary, could it be increased, since it doesn't
   allow the movement of even one block of common??
2. Could we have some comments about the efficiency (both
   time and ECS) of *doto* and *branch* relative to their
   obvious alternatives (e.g., *do* of separate unit,
   conditional *do* or *goto* separate unit, etc.) My
   limited experimentation showed that *doto* took more
   space than using a *do* of a separate unit. This
   surprised me, since I thought there was quite a bit of
   overhead in extra units. Is it to be expected in general?

---------- response 1
  02/07     10.39     rader       s

As to point number 1: It would be possible to increase
the limit to 5000, given the current buffer size that we
have available (an intermediate buffer must be used
to avoid difficuties with overlapping *from* and *to*
if the move is interrupted).

Could you increase it to the 5000, then? I have a comment

the following comments being moved up. I could program
around it, but it would be much easier to be able to move
the larger amount if nobody objects.

Using -transfr- rather than -move- sounds reasonable, and

I have slightly altered the comment code in library for you.
It now formats the comments in the first 150 variables
of common when DATA1 is pressed. (Person in charge of
library, please note). The common can be returned and
converted to source, then the first 150 variables can be
removed and stored elsewhere. The block is then converted
back to common for later comment use, with the stored
source code containing all the comments inserted up to
the time the comments were formatted.

The altered comment code is block k of lesson iu4. It
is used with block m of that same lesson.

just a thought....

can an additional search option be included in the editor

which would have the same effect as the *list symbols

option for the printer. it would be nice to find all the

old references to undefined variables by searching the

current block. of course one can do very well with the

printer, but it is very convenient to search while on-line.

     You want something like the X option which stops at

course lets you search for a particular symbol)

yes, rick.

i want to stop at every "variable", defined, undefined,
integer, floating point, common, router. *list symbols
now provides that information. of course one can search
for n1, but if you want to know if ANY variables are
referenced in a given block, the only sure way to check
is through *list symbols.

if one is only looking for all occurances of n1, the X
search option is great!

decide to use a charset instead of char commands

Our site allocation now seems to indicate that ECS
(all of it) is alive and well. Have we reached the
point where we may legitimately expect the full ECS
allocation to be available? Scheduling certain activities
during prime times is unwise for us unless you can
indicate the probability that full ECS will be available.
The new allocation has been quite reasonable...only when
"psych" is scheduled with several students does"network"give
any hassle at all; however, those times prompt me to ask
why the allocation scheme doesn't give credit to careful
scheduling? That is, when 5 students use lesson X, since
only one copy of the lesson proper is in ECS, why count
5? (ECS words for lesson proper) as part of site usage?

We will eventually implement some kind of a catalog that
permits access, but only to "published" lessons. The idea
would be that you could access an unpublished lesson only
by contacting authors, much as now (an unpublished lesson
would correspond roughly to lecture or text notes you are
working on). At some point an author could "publish" by
making the access name known in the catalog. At that
point he or his institution might register a copyright
on the student-mode representation of the lesson, with
the internal workings protected by classical "trade-secrets"
protections. More on this later--we are trying to formulate
policy in this area and will invite suggestions after we
have done a little more homework.

A modest proposal;
        As it currently stands, it is impossible to return
common to the disk under lesson control, except by typing
"common" on the lesson choice page. Could it be arranged
that a command of the form
jumpout  common
or something like that, takes you to the "common" option
on PLATO, or returns the common and takes you to the
appropriate place (student or author) in PLATO? This
would make it possible to "checkpoint" common when a
student leaves a lesson, or to return "formatted" common
blocks such as those used in algprob, moldraw, etc.
when an author leaves. But this would insure only one
disk access per student, i.e. when the student leaves.

Is there a screw loose in common somewhere? In recent days
I have observed more than one of each of the following
anomalies: (1) an aborted common returned to disk via
the return option; (2) an aborted common not being
replaced with a fresh copy upon new read-in of the
lesson; (3) a common on disk, returned there by virtue
everyone's having left the lesson (and by virtue of a
forced return just to make sure once I noticed the
problem), in disagreement with the in-core copy.

Needless to say, none of this is sufficiently replicable
that I can give a clear-cut example.

---------- note 272 vocabs
  02/10     04.03     mckeown       com

The new vocabs works fine IF i use specs okspell with it.
If I use vocabs without okspell, an answer (with spelling
error) which is judged ok under okspell causes an execution
error without okspell. The cause of the execution error is
an anscnt of -1! This seems unusual to me since the sequence
of judging commands contains a *no* command. Thus some
judging command must be matched. Judging code is in lesson
lesson cost, block j, vocabs is in block b. (The okspell is
in there since the lesson is in use by students.)

---------- response 1
  02/10     10.35     b sherwood       s

The first -concept- command encountered triggers a lookup
of the student's words in the vocabulary. If a word is
unrecognized, it is marked with uuuuuuu, and judging stops
with "anscnt" set to -1. Since you are using an indexed
variable v(anscnt), this gives you an execution error. You
will get an error even with "specs okspell" if the student
uses a word which is not in the vocabulary (misspelled or
not). Note that the final -no- command is not reached
because judging stops immediately (and the specs stuff is
done). We may change this to have the -concept- commands
skipped over in the case that a word is not recognized.
For the present you should check for anscnt=-1 just after
the -specs-.

I added a few lines to the aids writeup of -concept- to
explain how "anscnt" is -1 when a word is unrecognized.

----------- response 2
  02/10     10.43      b sherwood       s

As a matter of cultural interest, there is a similar
situation with -ansv- and "define student" (analogous to
-concept- and -vocab-). The first -ansv- (or -wrongv- or
-store-) encountered triggers a compilation of the student
response into executable machine code. If this is not
possible, due to missing parentheses or other problems,
something must be done. However, instead of aborting as
-concept- presently does, a flag is set to tell any
following -ansv-s (or -wrongv-s or -store-s) not to bother
looking at the student response; the effect is that all
the -ansv-s are skipped, and a final -no- will be matched.

Another point: until -concept- is changed so as not to
abort, -answer- commands must precede -concept- commands
if the -answer- commands involve words not contained in
the -vocab-, since the unrecognized words would make it
impossible to get past the -concept- to a later -answer-.

----------- response 3
  02/10     17.16     mckeown       com

I did not give you one vital piece of information, Bruce.
I have an *okxvocab* in the *specs*. Thus, I do reach the
*no* command under the following two cases:?
1. If I use a *vocab* (not vocabs) to set up my vocabulary
   and do not use specs okspell, i get the action specified
   by the *no* in all cases except a match with a concept.?
2. If I use a *vocabs* to set up my vocabulary and use specs
   okspell, I get correct and approximately correct answers
   judged correct with all others causing the action set by
   the *no*. No execution errors.?
What you describe in your first reponse is what happens
without *okxvocab*. What appears to be happening is that
a misspelling of a word in the vocab is being treated as a
term not in the vocabulary, but not covered by okxvocab.
I would think a misspelling would be either in the vocab or
acceptable with okxvocab.

---------- response 4
  02/10     18.01     tenczar       s

Interesting points, the previous....it gets quite deep
very fast...well, here is some more (mostly philosophy)...

By using the VOCABS (instead of the VOCAB) coommand, you
clearly state that you want spelling done. Of course, you
can use the  -specs okspell- to accept any misspellings
found. But, without the -specs okspell-, it is inferred
that you want spelling errors shown to the student (with
or without use of -specs okxvocab-). Thus, -specs okxvocab-
accepts all extra words in the VOCAB case...but, only those
that are clearly not misspelled in the VOCAB case.

At present, as Sherwood has stated, except for the
-specs okxvocab- ? VOCAB case, any "error" in the student
words causes an immediate exit from judging at the first
CONCEPT command. The reason for this is simply
efficiency...someday, maybe we will find a way around
this.

Your embedded mode works as advertised (see "embed" in

Concerning the rotate command:
     When I tried to rotate some text which was to be
written in size 0 it didn't work. When I switched the
size to 1 it worked. Is this supposed to be that way?
If it is, I think that rotate in size 0 should be added
since displaying something in size 1 takes much more
time than a display in size 0' and size 0 creates a much
nicer display also. Please consider.

---------- response 1

You're right, the rotate command only works for sized
writing. I agree with you though, that it sure would
be nice if it worked with size 0 writting. I think
that the problem is that the sized writing is done with
draw commands which are trivial to rotate but, size 0
is done with the built-in chars which cannot be rotated.

No, we haven't got a new data file!
What we have is a new course, called iudata. What we need
is a data file attached to course iu, or a new course
(iudata?) with a data file attached. The data file flags
on course iu are properly set to iudata, but since
iudata is a course rather than a data file, it returns
with the message "Not a Data File" .

Dave Broecker has already gone in and edited this file,
but since he does not know what a data file looks like,
he went ahead and worked on it like a course.

        the sign would be presented at any key press
        and would of course erase after a time limit

     Reasons: many! a sign would save many man-hours
     spent looking for non-existent faulty equipment,
     inform anyone who missed the last sign before
     the crash as to new or changed test times,
     for those with just one terminal, a sign would

that the computer itself is not working or that it is being

to those of us in distant places with just 1 terminal
example: we just spent the full weekend and all Mon.
morning waiting for system to come up due to keyset
failure - a sign would at least let us know if the
system was actually down, or if we should get on the
phone to trace the bug,etc...PLEASE consider it...

2) okay, if it would take too much rewriting etc, forget
it - just suggested it cause I've seen it on several

I believe that the PLATO DOWN sign is generated by hard-
ware when the sys-people decide it goes down OR when the
system goes down from other causes.(eg. crases) If such
a sign is available, temporarily then this could be
accessed via a NEXT or BACK keypress. (erasure could then
be done automatically as has been in the past by the
terminal hardware) Later, a piece of hardware could be
constructed with a simple register memory to store any
information as Caesar has requested above.

?? Your keypresses can not be recognized without a computer
to recognize them...or special hardware (!!). We realize
that there is a problem; and in fact worked out a scheme
a year ago that would have permitted us to at least send
a continuous message...which didn't pan out due to hardware
problems. There has been no recent work on this.

--------- response 5
  02/11     17.54     warner       tutoring

Keypresses connot be DIFFERENTIATED without the computer,
but all it takes is a simple circuit on the modem output
to recognize that a key has been pressed (or a touch panel
activated). Once that is done, a succession of bits could
be sent over that line from a simple ROM, or from an R/W
memory programmed in advance. This would not require a
computer, but merely an extra piece of hardware. Perhaps
it is not implementable now, bu maybe you should think about
it for PLATO V!

  As Bob Rader has indicated, a number of people have
spent a fair amount of time thinking about this problem
and possible things we might do. Nothing "do-able"
has been found yet. Note that the newer terminals are
supposed to have a 20-30 minute delay before doing a
full screen erase--this would mean that if there were
a message given prior to the system going off, or if
a "plato off" message were displayed, it would remain
visible for quite some time (not the current 5 minutes).

--------- response 1

No, the expression key=next is true (-) if the variable
*key* equals *next* (0202), and false (0) if they are not
equal. Thus you have a pause -1, or pause 0,
depending on the last key press.

This is a rather fundamental problem. There are now so
may things possible in TUTOR that some things which
you "know" from context are silly nevertheless actually
mean something. I remember a novice who wrote

define x=v1=3
       y=v2=7.8
       z=v3=2.5

and was puzzled because v1,v2,v3, were not initialized
to 3,7.8,2.5. But TUTOR thought he meant define x=(v1=3)
so that wherever an x was encountered TUTOR thought he
was asking the question "is v1 equal to 3?" Sigh.....

Aids does not say that pause cannot have a tag less than
.75. What it says is that the minimum pause _taken_ is .75.
So far as I know you can pause anything you want.

we now have auto-break and cpu limits.

If you have a segment of length 7, you will get 8 sugh

identical allocation. Is that indeed your question?

---------- response 3

You must pardon me, gentlemen. I was under the impression
that the remaining bits, 4 for length=7, were simply used
as the beginning of the next array location. Many pre-
viuosly baffling problems are brought to the light!

Let me get this straight. In any case where length is _not_
an even divisor of 60, the remaining bits of each variable
are thrown away? It would seem, then, that any length>30
array uses as much space as normal full variables, and is
therefore anything but efficeint.

I would certainly appreciate hearing that I misunderstood
Mr. Rader, and that the above is not the case. If it is,
should't this be made very clear in "aids"?

In notes consult, if somebody reads your note, agrees
to what you say ¬+ feels compelled to say so, you
don't get any answer because of the curse of the Big R

Generally speaking system people do read the replies in

In lesson helper, block b, coding as is works fine. If

take the * off the -return- so that the -return- is done

It would be nice after a long down like yesterday's if
someone from the system took a few minutes to write
a short explanation in NOTES. I am sure that such

I agree. It might be nice to explain on the Welcome page

Incidentally, for those who don't know, yesterday's
down was due to air conditioning problems.

---------- response 2
  02/14     08.44     judy       pso

The air conditioning problem was sufficiently serious, but
in addition, systems had a lot of trouble getting the
computer started again. (When it gets too warm the computer
shuts itself off automatically.)

I was told that some obscure switch on the big new disks
has to be set in a certain position in order to "dead-start"
the computer. Among the other problems, it took a long
time to figure out that that switch was giving trouble--
since we're not even using those disks yet.

Air conditioning has been a constant problem. We will soon
(within weeks, I think) have a complete back-up air
conditioning system. Also a back-up power system is being
developed..... (continued)

---------- response 3
  02/14     08.58     judy       pso

Two power problems affect the computer: 1) plain power
failure 2 ) voltage spikes on the power line. Often in
this area the power may be off for only a few seconds or
less, but that is plenty to make the computer go down. A
buffering system is being built which will protect against
both problems.

At present the power comes directly into the computer. The
computer has a "safety box" which kicks off if it gets hit
with a big power spike. It has no way to "average out" the
power spikes or to store power for a short power
interruption. With the new system the power will go into
enormous storage batteries (as in a car). The storage
batteries will in turn provide power for the computer.

This allows protection against power spikes and will give
back-up power for about 15 minutes.
Sorry about no news yesterday--systems forgot and I forgot
my role as "nagger".

A small point, but one I have found confuses many new
authors is the confusion that results from varying
terminology used in notes, aids etc to refer to bit
position. I think the best terminology is "right" and
"left" bits of a word. Many people evidently like
"top" and "bottom". One new author suggested PLATO
make up its mind whether they have horizonal or vertical
words. To be consistant with the naming of the shifts,
I vote for horizonal words and suggest all references
to "top" and "bottom" bits be purged from aids.

pause   keys=next,back
writec  key=next,next,,

Do a IERM "b" to get to unit b; hitting the BACK key takes
you directly back to unit a--without going thru the
-writec- statements. However, when proceeding to unit b
from unit a via NEXT, the BACK key is processed properly
after the -pause-. No problem when using a -pause [blank]-
instead. Any explanation, systems?

---------- response 1
  02/15     04.58     mckeown       com

(Not systems, but part of the explanation):?
When you enter the unit by use of a term, you are in a
help-type sequence and the back key is active. Thus, back
is processed at the pause as an active function key. When
you enter the unit by pressing next, you are not in a help
sequence and the back key is not active. Thus, presing
back breaks the pause, but doesn't cause a transfer to
anotehr unit. Part of the confusion here is that aids says
that an active help-type key will initiate the specified
branch (if included in "keys=" tag of pause), but the
back key is now not a help-type key(?). Should aids say
that a function key (except next) will initiate the
specified action?

---------- response 2
  02/15     09.59     rader       s
I believe edit, copy...(etc.) are function keys that do not
have any branching associated: so we will have to say
that if a help-type branch, a term branch, or a
(next1, back, back1,stop)-function branch is available,
and the pressed key has been "activated" at the pause,
the branch will be taken.

This issue has been raised before, but I have never seen
it answered. ?
Question: How can an author conveniently continue the tag of
          a write (or writec) statement so that it will
          display after the end of the material that will
          fit on one line in the editor'?
The obvious answer: use another write command works fine
except when you are displaying a wrong answer response and
the use of another write will cause the previous material to
be left on the screen.?
We either need a way of getting more character to a line in
the editor or a (probably) better way would be for the use
of *where* in an embedded at clause to give the correct
result. Then the next line of the write statement could just
start with ¬0at,where¬1.

---------- response 1
  02/15     02.23     blomme       s

   I find it rather hard to figure out what you are talking
about; you can't mean going on to the next line so you
presumably mean you have a line which requires more than
112 characters to put out a line of (up to 64) characters.
I guess that a full line of solid capital letters would
do that, but it surely does seem a fairly extraordinary
case. The simplest thing I can suggest (assuming I have
your problem right) is to precede your writing with
something like calc n1?where then follow the last
of your write commands (which each start ¬0at,where¬1)
with an at n1 and then a write command with a
sufficient number of blank lines to erase the writing.
(Ok--this has limits too if the writing is in the midst
of something else. I have nothing else to suggest in
the way of solutions.)

Thanks, I thought that the old CR CR CR had been disabled
as far as removing wrong answer responses, but find that it
is still hale and hearty.?
In answer to your implied question concerning the strange
things I must be doing to use up the 112 characters, it
involves things like underlining and embedded shows (which
can use up quite a bit more source code than display space).

---------- response 3
  02/15     09.25     rader       s
The old CR, CR, as you call it, will be much faster for
your case too: All those embedded things have to be
re-executed to be erased. Thus, if you don't need all that
ower, erasing with the "write CR, CR" etc. is to your
advantage.

No, that's the way it's supposed to work. One way of
getting around it is to have "charset" with a blank tag
before your charset command; this guarantees loading whether
you need it or not. Another way is to have this unit in
your lesson,
unit    chars
term    chars
at      1520 $$ or wherever
write   Loading characters
charset
charset yourlesson,yourchars

Well, I have one suggestion.....

        If you do any editing in the lesson, and then
stay on the same terminal, you will not get the message
again. It is often useful to know WHERE I last edited
a lesson, and this is the easiest way to find out.
And of course I would want to know if someone else had
been editing the lesson. I suppose that it would be
nice to be able to not see the note again, but who
cares? It seems to me that there are some things that
should be changed, and some that we might as well not
worry about. With all the current bugs, testing, and
Crunch, I could not care less about whether or not I
see "you last edited this...".

If I had thought it would take a major revision of the

I change terminals several times a day and find it annoying
to see what i consider useless information.
But that's about all the justification i can think of
for this minor improvement

  02/15     13.45     shlosberg       com

i know this question has been raised before, but i
think that it's worth resurrection.?
there is, i believe, a definite need for some type of
information regarding the completion of a printout
request. this is especially vital for datafiles that
are frequently in need of reinitializing--often with
a tight time schedule.?
i could see a couple of relatively simple methods of
doing this:?
   1) a sub-option in the request option to choose to
      be notified about print completion. this notification
      could either be in the form of some message in the
      lesson itself, or a special lesson entirely devoted
      to such a purpose.
   2) an option in the datafile to request a printout
      and prohibit reinitialization until the printout
      has been done.
i can't believe that in such a sophisticated system, there
is no way of implementing this feature.

There is a possible bug in the editor. The conversion of
a common block to a source block resulted in the creation
of a "statement" of ¬;1k chars in length. An attempt to
replace this line resulted in the following error:

lesson = edit
unit = replace2
current state = regular (pre_arrow)
last command = block
6th command
error type = bounds err

I realize that this is possibly an unusual thing to do, so
what I am really asking is: should the author be aware that
he may produce nonsense insofar as the editor is concerned?
 Also, is it possible to make this function crashproof and
still get a one to one mapping from common to source and
vice versa?
thanks,

Often you can avoid crashing by using the L1 option to

should eventually fix all this up.....

---------- response 2

Yes, before using the common to source option, the
author should know that he can produce garbage.
Yes, this could be made "crash proof". The easiest way
to do this would be to remove the option entirely.

The option is there for those who know how to use it,
and if they want to produce garbage, they may. They
should not expect the editor to try to handle their
garbage. I agree with bruce, this area should (and will)
be cleaned up.

I am not sure, but this problem may be related to the
problem I had with -ext- and autobreak. In lesson "exam",
block "c", unit "print" is a -return- which allows the
program to run as expected. Without it, the wherey seems to
be getting zapped.

-showa- updates the variables *where*, *wherex*, and
*wherey* by the number of characters displayed. The
actual change in the screen location by the -showa-
is not stored in *where* until the start of the next
timeslice (in this case, after the -return-).

WHY did you have to change the letters around with the
note names? The category difference doesn't bother me,
but the change from write to read and vice-versa sure does!
(i.e. a,which used to be read general, is now write help)
The note name change is a good idea.

The PLATO currently loaded (at 10:25) does not seem to
be working right at the NEXT_BACK_DATA_LAB_DATA1 page.
In particular, if you STOP1 out of edit mode, run your
lesson, then press STOP1 again, you are taken to this
page, but pressing NEXT from this page takes you to
"Choose a lesson to study" instead of to your lesson
in author mode.

blame me; I hoped that calling them HELP notes might

think whether their note was "of general interest" before
using that section). The interchange of read/write order
was not part of my "game plan" and we all agree it seems

   The system is "guaranteed" us 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. Monday
through Friday. You should ALWAYS be "backed out" and
your latest changes preserved whenever a new version of
the system is loaded. At other times, the system has
"crashed" and there is nothing anyone can do then to
recover your most recent work. Note: whenever you
get back to the lesson block display your latest changes
have been returned to the disk; this suggests that if
the system has been performing poorly and you are spending
a great deal of time in one block writing code, you should
do your own "back out" every so often.

It appears that there is a slight problem which can occur
when using specs noorder with concept. As indicated in
New System Features, this is a read-in feature so that it
affects all concept commands physically between a specs
noorder and the next specs command. This is fine, but a
problem occurs when a set of concept commands physically
follows a specs noorder, but logically follows (at
execution time) a specs command which does not include
noorder. In this case some of the concept commands will
accept only responses which have the first two parts of
the response reversed from their position in the tag of
the concept. They will not accept an answer given in the
order in which the terms appear in the concept. Some of the
concepts in the same judging process appear to be working
perfectly under noorder?
This situation should be fixed or flagged as an error
(probably at execution).

---------- response 1
  02/18     19.38     tenczar       s

If I could "flag" it as an error, then I could "fix" the
problem...but as I stated in NEW FEATURES...you will have
to "physically" order your -specs- and -concept- commands
in a "logical" order.

The -specs noorder- is a READ-IN (author) directive as well as
an EXECUTION (student) directive.
The only solution that I can figure out at present...
is to use 2 words per "concept" on read-in...but this
is a terrible waste of space...and will not be done.

If you must "physically" order your concept commands in
a "non-logical" order...you can always put in a few extra
-specs- commands to straighten things out...e.g.,

unit      wow             unit     wow1
specs     noorder         specs 
unit      concept1        unit     concept2

be writing over your text. But this would hardly be
improved by having another element in the display. If you
have a real problem I would like to hear about it; we are
unlikely to implement such a feature because of the
overhead. A cursor in a display that can be anywhere on
the screen is expensive (and appears unnecessary).

We used to have a cursor on Plato III which could be moved

for editting displays which are typed in columns.

One thing that would be useful in the editor in terms of
making replacement of lines easier would be removal of the
feature where erasure of the first of a set of underlines
(which are placed under text by backspaces) removes all the
backspaces and the text above the underlines. Examples:?
not(bs)(bs)(bs)___? 
When the underlines are erased, the whole thing disappears.
This is obviously not a major problem with the example given
but it can be very annoying when the text on the top line is
a complex expression, etc.

Stand still. A backspace followed by an erase i should have
no net effect on screen position. A subsequent backspace

followed by the writing of one letter should likewise
make no change.
The code performs as it should if size=0 (thus the note
name). It also performs as it should if the erase 1 is
replaced by the writing of a blank - which is unfortunately
not a solution to the problem since writing a blank in
size other than 0 in mode rewrite does not blank out the
character position.

A Modest Proposal:

It would be nice if there were a command doing the
opposite from what window does, that is, it would write
as usual EXCEPT within the boundaries of the window.

I think it would be very useful when one wants to add
to a display with draw commands etc, but protect some part
of it from overwrite, erasures and the like.

When editing a characterset, deleting a character
requests the -help1- key to authorize deletion.

However, when entering the charactercode as a number,
the -help1- key must still be preceded by a -next- key
(-next- terminates recognition of the code, "initiates
judging", and then -help1- authorizes the deletion.)

Does it not seem reasonable (especially since absolutely
no indication to the contrary is given) that the -help1-
key in this situation act as a jkey?
(In other words, people, I, too, am waiting for some

I agree that would be useful, as I have made similar

This might be the "pipe-dream" type of request, but--?
I think it would be very useful if some way could be set up
for a student in a course to request on-line help from his
instructor (if the instructor happens to be signed on). I am
thinking of something similar to the term "consult". I think
we all realize that (at least in this experimental stage)
not all of our programs are as well-explained as we would
like them to be so that some possibility of asking for
human help would be advisable. Second-best would be some
sort of flag in the active display in course records which
would label students who had requested help from an
instructor. This flag could even be set to be deleted
manually by the instructor.?
I realize the latter suggestion could be implemented by a
common attached to each lesson (or the router for a course),
but do not believe this is the approprate way to do it.

It might be that the natural connection would be to
an instructor or other resource person present in the
room, so that only a notification is necessary--he or she
then goes to the student.

---------- response 2
  02/20     16.58     mckeown       com

A notification readable on the system is all i am asking
for (since an instructor at a remote location
could monitor to help). I don't believe the assumption
should be that a resource person will always be in the
room (either now or in a stable system, but particularly
now when students lose scheduled times because of system
down time and must come in at unscheduled times). ?
I would not want to be in the position of assuming that
a resource person with the knowledge necessary to help the
student will have to be in the room at all times in a stable
system. It will become less likely that such a person wil
be on the system when called (as it should become less
likely that a student would need the help) as we move toward
a stable system.

I suggest that the -ansv- machinery simply add on a

is, if you wrote "ansv 64,.01" the system would treat

he filled up a whole lesson with his own leavings!
Using HELP1 (or possibly even LAB1) to judge an E

directive have a tag? I.e. why not allow the author
to declare, say, E10, and have his new block begin

At our location we have been running students on a pro-
duction basis for the past two semesters (including this 1).
With several hundred hours of student contact, we find most
students enthusiastic about CAI. Of the complaints recorded
many are lesson related, but also many have to do with
system shutdowns - both unanticipated and the '5 til'
shutdown. The problem we have here is that classes run
from the half hour until 20 after, and that means that
since students sign up for hours starting on the half hour
they are very prone to the '5 til' shutdown. I can change
it so students run starting on the hour. but this may
create quite a scheduling problem for them. I was wondering
if the policy regarding systems reloads could be reviewed.
I assume U of I is on a class schedule that starts on the
hour. Thus, merely moving the '5 til' shutdown will merely
move the problem. (cont,lab)

Systems testing is and forever will be necessary. And
generous use of restarts can to a certain extent circumvent
the problem. But it seems there must be a better way,
because restarts can never catch all these problems. It is
my understanding that new versions of PLATO can be assembled
and run along side the existing version. But to really
test a new version requires a big N of users. Perhaps
that N could be restricted to authors and systems and
pseudo users running pseudo test lessons so as not to
interrupt students who are running lessons for credit.
Since most users are now authors, this would allow the
systems testor to get a big N without interrupting
student use. Would this be possible to implement?

3)  Noone is deleted to make room for a student trying
to jumpout to another lesson-inhibit jumpchk doesn't help.

were not deleted to make room for another 1000 words.

of common attached?

2)  Indeed, not all cases can be handled by STOP1, tho
many are. No prediction on when improvements might
happen.

3)  The current algorithm does indeed permit authors
to stay in if they were initially under the total site
allotment. Only if they are over the allotment are they
bumped by students.

---------- response 2

WHY are authors allowed to stay in when students need the
space? It would seem that they should be deleted
regardless of the ECS situation when they condensed the
lesson. In fact, this policy would appear to favor authors
who are staying in lessons longest. (These are in many
cases game-players since most debugging can be done rather
quickly.)?
Another interesting point is that I have been deleted from
lessons when I did not receive the ECS warning as I
condensed. This would appear to be contrary to the situation
you are describing, Bruce?

An author using more than 1000 words can be deleted by a 
student at the same site

An author will not be deleted if there is someone at another
site in the same lesson who is not over his ecs allotment..
since games are usually in use by several logical sites at
the same time an author in a game does not get deleted...
this may be changed eventually...

No gaurantee was ever made that -stop1- would always be 
pressed before a lesson is deleted... in most cases the

I still believe that games do not belong in their current
position on the system and believe that instructors should 
be the ones consulted about that particular part of a
"working" instructional system.?
A condition for any game, which can not be justified (in any
way) as instructional, to remain on the system should be
the inclusion of command which will render the game
unusable at any logical site whose director has a firm
policy that games are not to be played at any time. I 
particularly include 203b ERL in that that policy is stated

Although I can agree as far as games authors having
some responsibility towards the system as a whole, it
does not seem that we should be responsible for any
particular site. The extra code involved, while making
things easier for you, unfarily taxes the allotments of 
sites that allow such activities.
By an large, most games _authors_ seem to have some heart
with regards to when their games are available. ie, empire
is not available during normal classroom hours, nor will
nova be when completed. However, in order to perform these
checks, it is still necessary to haul in the entire
lesson, which leaves you about where you started.
   It would be nice if it were possible to do these
checks, in designated lessons, by some system flag.

to work as integers, and since n-type variables can't hack
floating point numbers, I'Ve tended to follow the lead of
my ole' mentor Bruce Sherwood and use only v-type variables
except where I'm doing character manipulation or some such.
I vote to keep it the way it is, is spite of the fact that 
my current project would work better the other way.

I vote for the integer display since in has always been
my impression on any computer system that integer arithmetic
is more efficient that floating point arithmetic (as long 
as mixed mode is not necessary). Thus, I believe we, the 
authors, should be encouraged to use n-type variables where 
the values will only be integral. This has to be more
efficient particularly for control variables. Another
problem with v variables is that the very convenient *shows*
embedded show does not work at all well with v-type.?
Obviously, we can live with either, but I cannot remember
ever being interest in v-variable values when referring to
course records variables.
One thing about the integer display, though: Why not
display the full integer value instead of ignoring the
first 12 bits, It is annoying to have to change to octal
mode to find out whether an integer variable is really 0
or just has last 48 bits 0.

---------- response 3
  02/22     17.41    b sherwood       s

My philosophy has been that new authors should be taught 
only the v-variables (v for variable), since these will
work properly in essentially all situations. Then when
an author gets to explicit bit manipuation he/she could 
learn about n-variables. Note that string manipulations
(storea, showa, move, search) do not require n-variables,
since the variables merely specify addresses. There is 
cation takes exactly the same time whether using v- or n-
variables on our computer.

I agree that -shows- should be fixed up to not show a 
decimal point nor trailing 0's when the v-variable contains
an integer. We may change -shows- to just show an integer 
if the fractional part is zero.

The machinery for "showing" goes through a floating point 
format at an intermediate stage...thus, your top 12 bits?^*V
will have disappeared in this conversion. It is not
worth our while, I think, to try to correct this--rather,
I would favor limiting all integers to 2?^48V-1 or less.

?^*V(Note--the sign bit is, or course, not actually lost in
this conversion.)

re the -non variable jumpout-: well, just another bad
upset. I am really wondering when the time will ever come
that a lesson that conforms to TUTOR will conform to it
ever after. I realize system's problems in trying to
research inside of a production system (I assume that
PLATO tries to be called that), but I find no excuse for
your complete ignorance of compatibility desires!

        This change is being made in the interest of long-
term compatibility! We know that as PLATO grows, we shall 
have to make changes in the theory and practice of lesson
names and lesson interconnections. This change will make
possible the automatic conversion of lessons when those
changes are implemented.

        We readily admit that we are unable to introduce
each new feature the "right" way the first time. Perhaps
some of the changes could be anticipated, but not all. If
we had tried to design the complete system before opening
it for use, it would not have been available during your

We try to introduce new features in their most general and

Bill, I think you got that wrong...

By compatibility I mean that lessons that people wrote
who have been paid for it in the past, will continue
to work in the future....

And as for these first attempts: about the worst upset
I can think of was the mess with the timeslice last fall.
Now as any diligent student of an elementary paper on 
time sharing systems knows, the first thing that is
ever implemented in such a system is the masking of the
timer interrupt from the shared users...
You cannot claim that you had no way fo knowing that 
eventually you would mask the timer interrupt from your
authors...

And the new lesson names: with 5 disks you have some 4000
lesson spaces. Will, again, a linear search of this list
may take a while. That, too, could have been anticipated.

This is still not quite the point. Our mistake in
file naming conventions was to miss the (now obvious)
point that any possible future changes in file naming
conventions would be impossible if file names are
constructed by algorithms, whereas if the file names
appear as literal character strings in source code a 
source conversion would be possible. This is not to say
that we will necessarily change the file naming rules,
but we want to retain the possibility of doing so in
case later users need some other scheme than is now
used.

I take the credit and blame for having realized that
file names must be literal source code to preserve upward 
compatibility in the future. I might point out that in
several years no user nor system programmer happened to
notice this problem, or corrective action would have been
taken sooner (and the -jumpout- command would have had
a different form).

  02/23     01.29     warner       tutoring

A suggestion concerning the jumpout arrngements currently
being shown in new features;
Could the jumpout code be changed so that _both_ lesson and
unit need to be replaced by "return" in order to have a
2-argument jumpout? Thus, a if a student jumps into lesson
"b" from lesson "a", unit "c", then in lesson b the command 
jumpout return
takes the student back to the ieu of lesson "a",
while the command 
jumpout return,return
takes the student back to unit "c" of lesson "a".
In addition to providing more flexibility from the author's
point of view, this scheme would prevent unavoidable errors
in sample-type lessons like iudemo, when a student who
presses BACK to return to a prior lesson is forced to take
a 2-argument jumpout, which bombs with a codeword error.

Is this change necessitated by conversion from lesson 
names to numbers on the new disks?

I strenuously object to the requirement that jumpouts
not refer to variables. Specifically, I cannot imagine
how to solve the following problem in the context of the
new jumpout:?
On entering lesson x, a from n10 is executed, and n10 is
compared with a (small) list of "sub-lessons". If no
match is found, n10 is saved in n11. Lesson x can
later jumpout to one of these "sub-lessons".
Eventually, the "sublessons" will return to lessons x,
the above from and comparison is done, and n11 is not
changed. Now, when lesson x wants to return to the
lesson which called it, a jumpout (n11) is done.?
How in the world can I do this with the new jompout?
unknown ahead of time.?
(continued in 1st reply)

---------- response 1
  02/23     10.51     friedman       csa

The same problem arises in the simpler case of two
inter-dependent lessons which jumpout back and forth
between each other while executing. When they finish,
an "end lesson" is not necessarily appropriate. How does
one code a reture to the lesson which originally entered
the pair??
I suggested to DMA some time ago a scheme for saving, not
just the most recent lesson which executed a jumpout, but
a stack, say 3 to 6 deep, of jumpouts. That kind of an
approach might be slightly expensive of student bank
variables or something, but could solve the problems I
have pointed out above. The stack, of course, would have
to be popped on executing some special kind of jumpout,
say, a "jumpout return".

of what we had planned to do in the way of letting teachers

such a serious loss of flexibility?

Are the variable jumpout commands being made illegal simply
to simplify the conversion necessary to allow for
conversion of lesson name structures? If this is the case, I
believe that we should not be required to redesign our
entire branching structure. This is essentially what you
are asking the more developed curriculum sequences to do.
(You should at least allow us the option of making the
required manually since most variable references are in our
index lessons.)?
Also, you are making it virtually impossible, as mentioned
above by john, to allow the instructor to custom design his
own sequence, Given human nature, as it is usually found in
instructors, this will essentially be the death-knell of
your goal, you are making excellent progress toward it
with this change!?

As far as I am concerned, you will probably have 0
accounting students on the system when this change is made.
It will be easier for me to train them to reference the
lessons themselves as authors than it would be to waste the
time required to rewrite the branching structure to
circumvent this restriction. The time would be wasted
because few other instructors are going to use my lessons
in exactly the sequence that I will have to impose rigidly.?
Why does the from command have to go? It had other uses
besides setting variables for later jumpout. In particular,
I need to know in several lessons where a student came from.
This can obviously be done by flags, but I see no reason to
remove this use of the from command.?

Also, the system note implies that the new jumpout command
is available now. If so, I couldn't make it work when I
tried to find out how much space this abortion was going to
require. (I will admit the jumpout I tested was about 8
lines long, but this is exactly what you are requiring us
to do with this monster.)It is particularly disastrous since
most of the complex jumpouts will be in router lessons which
must be in core at all times.?
In summary, I think you ought to take this one back to the
drawing board and find another solution to whatever problem
it is that you have! ?

If my comments sounded abusive, I apologize. But I agree
with Jim McKeown that the provocation has been great in
this case. I happened to have a very brief chat with Dave
Andersen a few days before this was announced, in which he 
suggested the kind of jumpout he was considering, and I
voiced a few objections. But I was hurried, and we did
not have any kind of useful discussion. This thing will
really have drastic effects on the C. S. plans for
operating a collection of 100 to 200 or more lessons, with
provision for instructors who are not authors to select
a subset of these for their students, and students to select
from the subset by use of a conversational guide.
The more I think about it, the more concerned I am that
the end product of the guide--a lesson name for the student
to execute--will be unuseable!

It would take a conditional jumpout, or collection of them,
approximating one whole block of source code, to implement
our scheme! And this would have to be in the router
lesson, with the index of the condition set in a different 
lesson on the basis of data stored in a common somewhere.
(Our guide program is two lesson spaces so far, with a
large common--far too much to be itself the router lesson.)
This will lead to fantastic bookkeeping errors, and means
that entering a new lesson into the sequence will require,
not just a new entry in the common, but also code changes 
to the router lesson. This will NEVER work!

Judy, I don't intend to count the notes. You may be correct
as to total, but I don't think the issue here is who has
written the most abusive notes. The issue, as I see it, is
that the four people named in your first reply in this
series have invested a lot of time and resources into
development of materials on PLATO. Under the current 
structure, we have to accept whatever policies are set
concerning the system, tutor, etc. The only effect we can
have on these decisions is persuasion. What I am asking for
is the opportunity to engage in that persuasion. After all,
the success of PLATO as an instructional system is dependent
on the authors as well as the system programmers. If we,
the authors, don't do our job properly, the future of PLATO
on this campus, at least, will be very limited. It can be
very difficult for us to do our job will under some of the
conditions we are working under.?

I don't know Risken and Schreiner, so I will make these two
comments concerning only George Friedman and myself:?
1. Up to the current situation, I did not perceive Goerge's
notes as out of line, nor did I perceive that I was
previously "shooting off my mouth" about anything except
game-playing (which continues to interfere with instruction)
(My original note here did contain a little hyperbole for
which I will I apologize, but the points raised are still
valid.)?
2. Both George and I teach courses concerned with the design
and use of large-scale computer systems. Although we
obviously don't know as much about the inner workings of 
the PLATO system as the system programmers, we should be 
given credit for the knowledge necessary for intermittently
forming opinions or gathering facts which would be useful
to the development of the PLAO system.?

  02/24     12.32     b sherwood       s

To repeat slightly what is in the new features notes and 
in some recent general feature notes, the new jumpout
and from facilities were conceived to insure future
upward compatibility should there ever be a change in 
the way lessons are accessed. It seems unlikely that we
now know the "final" word in cataloguing schemes. It is
conceivable that forever into the future lesson will be 
accessed simply by a 10-character name. Then again, maybe
not--maybe instructors will reference lessons by subject
area and/or catalog number. Or maybe Dewey decimal library
labels will be used. Who knows? All of us, users and
system programmers alike, missed the point that we might
be building in a naming structure which we later would
curse (better to curse now!) Again, it is quite possible 
that the present file naming scheme will stay or be a
nice subset of some later scheme.

Please note that the new features are _added_ features for
the present--they allow you to do new things. Some of
the notes point up difficulties in doing certain kinds of
routing. If there are important things the old scheme
would do and the new scheme cannot do, then we indeed
may find that no change in lesson naming will ever be
possible. Or perhaps the old scheme could stay forever,
but with warnings that conversions by hand might be
necessary sometime in the future. Or the old scheme could
be a subset of some kind. Please do give us feedback on
the nature of difficulties you would encounter if you
could not refer to a constructed lesson name through
a variable.

It is very unfortunate that none of us, user or system
programmer, noticed this potential problem from the 
beginning. If -jumpout-, etc. had been conditional
instead of variable from the beginning these questions
would not now arise. Please do tell us what kinds of 
things would be difficult under a new scheme, in addition
to blaming us for having to recode some data and
programming structures.

For example, I think Friedman's problem could be solved 
be somehow distinguishing between lessons so intimately
connected together that they would be one lesson if there
were no length limit, and lessons which do jumpouts to
quite different lessons. Aslo, is it conceivable that 
router lessons need variable jumpouts and other lessons 
do not? Then any future conversions would be limited to
a much smaller number of router lessons and their data,
not all lessons in general.

As it stands now, with the new -from- and -jumpout- formats
from what I have read in the preceeding notes, the major 
problem remaining is the case that the lesson name is passed
in a variable; for example, a student jumps to the router
from lesson Q and is routed through a sequence of several 
lessons, then is to be routed back to Q, or an instructor
designs a routing sequence by typing in lesson names that 
are stored in common. Since there must be some system

[text jam and not clear]
could be altered to allow use of variables that contain
a lesson code, or in the case of from, puts the lesson code

into the variables, This would allow all of the current 
flexibility (with the exception, that, routers can no
longer display the lesson previously visited, as some
do) without the user being aware of the form of a lesson
name. When the form of a lesson name is changed, it will
merely require rewriting a single system routine. If lesson
names stay the way they are, the system routine. could be 
written as a dummy that merely returns the argument.

Parrello put his finger on one problem which elimination
of variable jumpout would indeed create. In our routers
an instructor can type in file names and descriptive names
for lessons in student mode, and arrange them in any
order or combination he wishes on an index list. This
rudimentary "instructor mode" has proved quite useful to
instructors who want to use lessons with their classes,
but are not authors. I don't see a way to do this 
without a variable jumpout.

A very simple and perhaps useful application of the
variable jumpout is: instructor (counsellor) tells student
what lesson to run, student comes to terminal, plugs lesson
and unit name into variable jumpout, and takes off. There
will be no way to do that. And if the counsellor is a
program, one might as well forget it.

Bruce: a response, as requested.
I wholeheartedly agree with the idea that variable jumpouts
should be retained and an appropriate warning about the
possible need for later hand conversion given. There are
two readons for this: (a) this leaves the decision-making
power in the hands of the user - something much to be
desired as long as it doesn't interfere with the operation
of the system. (b) Any large-acale curriculum effort has
to do a great deal of file maintenance of its own. In our
case there are service lessons which keep file and unit
names in common. Any conditional jumpouts would be generated
as TUTOR source through these lessons. There is no way your
conversion routines can change this common data base, and so
the next time we wanted to shift files around we'd have to
**continued**

---------- response 1
  02/24     13.49     john r       r1

make the appropriate by-hand conversions in our service
routines, and then generate some new jumpouts. In other
words (1) a large-scale project will almost certainly not
be able to avoid hand conversions of many things; (b) the
elimination of a variable jumpout imposes great clumsiness
because it requires the repeated conversion of binary data
bases to TUTOR source code - and that is something that the
potential user of curriculum materials should not have to
be concerned with.

---------- response 2
  02/24     14.46     blomme       s

   Part of the point of all this was that if such a 
conversion should be necessary, we just have to make it
possible now--if the change must come, then now is the
time to provide for it, not 6-9 months from now when it
has finally become evident to all that we cannot continue
in the same mode of operation. Quite seriously, those
who are saying essentially: "not now! I'll do it by
hand when the time comes..." are the ones who will have
created so many lessons by then that not even the callous,
arrogant systems programmers could conceive of asking
them to make such a change then (or, if they did, would
essentially be making the decision that that curriculum
would be inoperable for a month or two).
   Changes of some sort in lesson handling (maybe naming
conventions and means of inter-connection) are likely to be
necessary as we progress on towards thousands of users and
hundreds of thousands of lessons.

---------- response 3
  02/24     15.44     john r       r1

I see your point. However in the case of the elem reading
curric project, our router lesson has only _one_ variable
jumpout and it is driven by a common data base - which will
have to continue to exist for other reasons and to be
changed by hand whenever necessary regardless of how many
lessons are involved. I heartily assure you that having
been informed of the contents of the goblets, I prefer
to choose my own poison.

Our other lessons intended for students, by the way, have
no variable jumpouts - all connections are done through
the router.

----------response 4
  02/25     00.22     b sherwood       s

Which is why I suggested that maybe what a router lesson
does might be different from what non-router lessons do
in this respect. That at least localizes the trouble
spots.

I would be happy to accept a situation where variable
jumpouts would be limited to routers. I do not believe
that this would mean that certain curricula would be
inoperable for an extended period of time. I think the
necessary changes could be performed by hand in no more
than a couple of hours in another lesson to prepare
for insertion into the router when the change is made.?
The other reasons for allowing variable jumpouts in routers
are related to the space problem in routers particularly
when combined with the new *from* command. I can't text
since I can't get the condensor to accept the thing, but I
have trouble believing it will not take more space than the 
variable jumpout.?
I assume that those who wish to use the conditional jumpout
in their routers would be free to choose that alternative.

---------- response 6
  02/26     10.56     deiss       pharmacy

Speaking of localizing a difficulty. A couple weeks ago when
the jumpout codeword feature was added, I decided to 
put all my jumpouts in my router into one basket.
I created an argumented subroutine whose arguments are th
name of the lesson and the name of the unit to jumpout to.
I named the unit link. Now whenever I want to access ano-
ther lesson I just link('lessonname','unitname') where
either of the two arguments can be computed variables,
of course. This comes in very handy after a jumpout fails
because one can determine the nature of the failure and save
the info along with the name of the lesson which needs
repair. Also if the jumpout fails due to inadequate ECS,
the router simply gives the user the option of linking
again. If we are forced to have a bunch of separate
computed jumpouts, error recovery will become so unruly
that we might as well do away with routers also.

  02/24     15.08     friedman       csa

I gather from bits and pieces in previous notes and replies
that the reasoning behind the new jumpout is concern that
the present file naming conventions are too simple. I
suppose this implies that, at some time in the future,
plato file names MIGHT have to be more than a simple 10-char
single-level name, perhaps a tree of qualified names, or 
something (something undefined at this time). Ok, that
does sound like a problem (but note that the present
scheme, if mnemonics are abandoned, allows for 26?ˆ10??
lessons, even if only alpha chars were allowed).?
If something like this were done, it would seem that
ALL lessons would have to be renamed, and all code contain-
ing lesson names therefore would be rewritten anyway!?
Aren't we going to an awful lot of trouble for the sake of
something which MIGHT become necessary?? 
I gather the new disks are not relevant to the problem.

---------- response 1
  02/24     22.38     blomme       s

The new disk system is relevant to the issue in that 
we are now re-designing out handling of files (this is
nothing the user should see though) in order to be able
to handle over 100,000 files without any problems. Some 
people have raised issues regarding the "naming" and
inter-connecting of lessons in this environment ; one
new feature proposed for the future is to let people have
their own "pet" names for their lessons and to do it in
such a way that several people could use the same pet
name yet refer to different lessons.
I personally find obnoxious the idea of using numbers
instead of names for lessons and am not convinced that
the pet name idea has much to do with file organization
problems; these questions remain somewhat open and at
present only a few preliminary steps  are being made--
nothing has been lost as yet.

rstartl and rstartu will not be affected by the new jumpout
procedures. Am I correct?

Probably OK, since any conversion could change the 
lesson names in the student's course record. But note
that "jumpout resume" eliminates much of the previous
need for these variables.

As long as discussions on printing are the order of the day,
here's a quickie:

How about an option to print the block display page: this
would give a quickie view of the lesson space, and tell
you what blocks were condensed, how big they are, where
to expect them in the body of the print, etc. Seems this
might be useful.

Should it be right after the line requesting it or
somewhere at the end? Or somewhere else?

---------- response 2
  02/25     16.21     obrien       uicc

I would suggest at the beginning or the end of the print;
the beginning as a natural place to start reading, or the 
end as the place where the rest of the tables are.

---------- response 3
  02/26     09.53     judy       pso

But I am puzzled--how would it be useful?

You can find any unit by looking it up in the table...

The partial condense options are probably the easiest
possible thing to change. Your prints would (presumably)
have to be sent to Chicago which would cause a delay of
a couple of days. I would think that the probability of
having the "p" options be the same at print time as at
arrival of print time would be practically zero.

Or is it the "words remaining" that interests you?

---------- response 4
  02/26     11.25     obrien       uicc

I was suggesting this as a matter of general interest to
all, not particularly minding where I happen to be. In
fact, we are probably going to have to "do our own thing"
in the matter of prints before too long...this there-day
wait is getting to be a drag.
I just suggested the block display page as neat overview
of the contents of the lesson, figuring that we're used to
it since we see it so often. Tells us order of blocks, etc.
Since it would be pretty easy to print everything, we could
just let people appreciate whatever parts they wanted.

  02/25     12.08     tamar       cerlcc

As a response to b sherwood's question.
jumpout return,return
seems to be the perfect answer for using 'subroutine
lessons' where you dont want to be back on the same unit.
For people that want to came back to the same unit (like
index units), the answer is: insert a new next unit
to be : jump sameunit.
( That couldn't be done in the first unit so easily)

How about:
jumpout return 2,return 2
for jumping back to the lesson and unit 
two jumpouts ago.

OR:
joinout command that will work for lessons as for units,
but comes back to next unit instead of next command.

---------- response 1

No.... the jumpout return 2,return 2 would require
additional storage in every students status bank... this
is quite expensive in terms of ECS

Various forms of -joinout- have been considered ... but
for now there are no plans to implement anything of the
sort...

It is becoming increasingly clear that the issues
involved are too complex to fit into one note, thus
making any discussions in notes extremely difficult
and incomplete at best. Would it be possible to set
up a discussion among systems personnel and users to
determine:
1)What changes are in the planning stages that
might make variable jumpouts impossible
and/or very difficult from a systems view-
point.

flexibility from the author viewpoint while 
remaining independent of the structure of a

---------- note 262 common
  02/25     13.20     obrien       uicc

Two small gripes concerning common:

I just spent a couple of hours this weekend finding out
that when a block of source is converted to common, there
may be extra garbage tacked on at the end. I had assumed
that the common, when formed, would be zeroed out from
the end of the code on down, using the pointer in the
lesson directory. Could this be made the case, or does
someone depend on this not being the case?

Alos, when I was working in the wee hours and commons were
not disappearing from ECS, I had a distinct problem loading
a new common from disk to ECS. In spite of the fact that
the common block had a new name, and the -common- statement
referenced it by the new name, the old common was being
attached. Al McNeil says he has also had this problem in
the past. Only moving the common to a new lessonspace
forced a new loading.

---------- response 1
  02/25     18.40     blomme       s

The problem of non-zeroing has been on the "to be fixed"
list for so long nowI blush to think about it--can only 
say it is well known and WILL be fixed (eventually).
I frankly cannot imagine what could be going on in the
latter case. One remark though: you must change the 
name of the common and change you reference to it and
also recondense the lesson. Note that during late night
hours the "old" common may linger around ecs for hours
and hence still be there to create problems should you
change the name back again later to the original name.
(Needless to say we need some slightly better control
here; something will be forthcoming one of these days)

Not only may garbage get tacked on at the end,
the whole block may be replaced by garbage - somebody else's
block. (It seems to be systems-type stuff that gets 
substituted most often.)
Although it may often be possible for somebody
on systems to find and restore your stray block if you
request it in time, not everybody knows this - I didn't
when I lost 2 days' work last week.
Could a warning be inserted somewhere logical -
say, on the "Press next to convert to common, page -
that you should only convert a block of which a backup
copy exists (the standard practice among those familiar with
the system quirks)/ (does the same danger exist when
converting common to source, by the way?)

---------- response 4
  02/26     11.31     obrien       uicc

SO FAR AS I KNOW, (please correct if I'm wrong, oh please!)
converting common to source and v.v. just changes a few
things in the block directory which tell the editor what
kind of block it is. So, the garbage is strange indeed...
I've never seen it.
Regrading the Immortal ECS common": I changed the name of 
the common block, changed the reference in the -common-
statement, and forced a recondense from the editor...old
common was still attached. Uh-oh... (sheepishly)...would
an -abort common- statement have this effect...'cause there
quite likely was one...

---------- note 280 abort flag
  02/25     19.08     john  r       r1

It sure would be nice if there were a way to sense that
a common was aborted - a thing that can happen if one
has forgotten about an abort command that was put in
during testing. (Of course there _is_ a way, but doing
40 minutes' work, shifting to author mode, and examining
the block of common where one was working is not
conducive to low blood pressure if the common was in an
aborted state.)

Does anyone else feel need for an abort flag?

---------- response 1
  02/26     11.34     obrien       uicc

It would be handy, since I had the same thing happen to me
the other day, but some thought would be necessary for
implementation: it would have to obtrude itself upon your
attention with no further programming than the -abort-
command itself, or you might just as well keep track of
the -about- yourself, but it shouldn't be so obvious as
to be annoying...perhaps a little message when you STOP1?

  02/25     22.00     carter       comm

    Perhaps it would be better for all if the jumpout
controversy were viewed philosophically. Points to
consider:
(1) The comments by Mckeown, Friedman, Risken, and 
Schreiner on this and many other issues must be
considered a system asset. I refer any who disagree
(Judy?) to Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety and
Shannon's 10 10ˆtˆh theorem.

(2) The reason I view the issue in this light is that 
some of the lessons I supervise are still not
fully operational as a result of changes last fall.
Hence, it makes more sense at present to secure
funds to hire maintance programmers than to code new
lessons.

(3) The discussion the last few days makes exceedingly clear
the fact that the most serious problem PLATO currently
faces is the compatability of old lessons and new
systems.

---------- response 1
  02/25     22.22     carter       comm

(4) Various PLATO people seem divided on the issue of 
the value of user feedback. A statement of system
policy affirming the fact that one of our most 
critical system resources is people such as those
refered to in (1) would be worthwhile. Users such
as Mckeown, Umpleby, Friedman, Trollip etc. work
very hard to improve the usefullness of PLATO without
having to be paid a cent by CERL. Try to find
such a resource in industry.

(5) I have been around for 20 months and this is the 
first time I've seen Judy Sherwood lose her cool.
(re response to note 179). Many users lose it several
times a week. I hope this comment adds some
perspective to the discussion.

But it seemed to me that the note 'from gail' was of general

Plato is an experimental system or whether users can expect
to get something as a minimum service for the fees they are
charged.
If notes about system policy are anathema in part b, some-
thing should be done about it real soon. Like create a notes

Would it be possible to call a special meeting between

of selecting a file naming convention that will provide
the flexibility and long range expandibility needed for 
disk system implementation.......and at the same time
provide authors with some concrete way to doing variable
jumpouts, joinouts, and such without having to worry
about drastic incompatibilities in the future? It seems
silly to remove features from the system every time
someone decides they might create a problem in the future.
It makes more sense to face the problem head-on now
and develop a naming convention now rather than waiting
for the optimal solution to just walk up an present itself
a couple years from now. A little planning goes a long way.

The whole point of removing variable jumpouts was
to ensure system compatability in the future. Thus, when
a descision is finally made on the best type of lesson
cataloging scheme, we will be able to run a system - wide
conversion of all present lessons (if nescessary).
This is an experimental system, and we do make
mistakes. The allowing of variable jumpouts in the first
place was a lack of foresight on out part, and we regret
having to change it now.

I agree with the need for a meeting. If the only thing
that it would accomplish would be to ease tensions between
systems and users, that would be sufficient reason. The
aura of pontificating (deserved or not), and the accusatory
tone of users' notes (actual or imagined), has only ser-
ved to point out a long-standing chasm between groups
within PLATO. Maybe a general meeting can do nothing to
alleviate this condition, but I hope others feel that one
more try is in order. The (almost) meeting before Xmas
was a good try, but the weather and logistics of the
season ensured that it did not come off. How about an-
other attempt? Say, 7 pm some day next week?

Yes, a meeting is definitely needed. Even if the actual
details of any new naming system are invisible to the user,
it still helps a great deal to know what is actually going
on when you are writing a lesson. Secondly, the variable
jumpout is a powerful tool for creating individualized
lesson sequences, and it is essential that the possible
benefits of removing variable jumpouts are weighed against
the disadvantages. From the author's point of view, it
still looks like we are deleting a major feature of the
tutor language just in case we might possibly someday make
a hypothetical change in the structure of lesson names.
It would cool a lot of the anger out here if some specific
plans were presented.
Besides, some of us stupid, whining, ignorant authors might
have some good ideas!

  02/26     11.53     eland       csa

This note is a vote in favor of keeping the "from" command
(or the provision of a fitting substitute): I understand
the problem of using "from" to "feed" a jumpout command. But
there are situations where one simply wants to know where
someone came from. Such information would enable branching
decisions to be made, or it might just be saved for some
type of documentation [eg. all comments about computer
science lessons are kept in one place -- we have to know
the name of the lesson from which each comment was made].
It is not practical in such situations to use the "match"
form of the "from" -- too many lessons would have to be
listed, and the list would constantly be changing.?
What hopes do we have of still getting the "from" info???

still that what an author does with his/her lesson (short

For the moment you can take care of that by writing

In about ten days a CERL Report, X-41, will be published on
the subject of PLATO curriculum materials, most of which
have been tested out in the 'classroom' (referred to as
'subject-tested'). The report will be of special interest
to teachers considering using PLATO programs.

The report is not a catalogue of PLATO lessons, name by
name, but of topics about which lessons have been written.

Copies of the report will be available in the CERL library
for any persons who may wish them; and copies will be
mailed to the PLATO remote sites. It is the intention to
update and revise the report periodically so as to add newly
tested materials and correct omissions or errors.

I may be the only one on the system who has the following
problem: At  times the automatic system note 'plato will
go down in 3 minutes' which is inserted on the student
page causes one plotting routine of mine to go crazy!
The reason is that I am plotting the location of one
point which is connected to the previous, and so on.
The inserted note sets an 'at' point on the screen which
of course causes all lines to be drawn to the note.
The problem itself is that we are filming each of these
drawings to create an animated sequence (the extra 'random'
lines really don't add much). My question is: could an
option be created (or a command) that would prevent such
a system note (or any outside monitor, etc.) from being
displayed?

---------- response 1
  02/27     12.20     b sherwood       s

Read the writeup carefully. The "keys=" option of the
-pause- command allows you to specify all keys that will
not be discarded by the -pause-. Any (listed) key
not discarded by the -pause- will be looked at to decide
what to do with it. In particular, if it is the DATA key
and you have a preceding -data- command, the branch to
the data unit is taken. If you want the DATA key only to
take you past the -pause-, place the -data- command
after the -pause-.

I grant you that this is not necessarily the way you 
might guess it would work, but careful consideration of
cases seems to show that this is indeed the appropriate
way to have it implemented. Of course the NEXT key is
a little special in this respect, in that the unit
specified by the -next- command will be branched to only
upon completion of the present unit, not upon pressing
the NEXT key at a -pause-.

---------- response 2
  02/27     12.22     b sherwood       s

Note too that the handling of the TERM key is a little
special in this respect. Unless you say keys=term, the
TERM key will be discarded and not take you past the
-pause-, but if you do say keys=term the TERM key will
ask "what term". The only way to have the TERM key take
you past a -pause- is to use a blank -pause- statement.

Thanks for your quick response, Bruce.?
My problem was not that DATA took me to unit choice, but
that NEXT did NOT take me to unit choice. To me there is an
inconsistency here: the system "obeyed" my "data key"
branch, but ignored the "next key" branch which I had
specified. It seems to me that a "next" command ought to
be in effect as soon as it is executed, rather than waiting
till the end of the unit before it is considered.?
What do you think?

---------- response 4
  02/28     08.38       parrello       uimatha

The NEXT key is very special, since it is used so often
at arrows, etc. to move a person along. The beauty of the
pause keys=funct is that it allows all the function keys
to be operative, but still gives you a way of pausing in
the middle of a page (giving the student time to think about
what has been written) and then continuing without erasing
the screen (by pressing NEXT).

---------- response 5
  02/28     10.38     rader       s

It is intended that the new pause permit you to take
"help"-type branches, and special braches--just as
though you were at an arrow. The -next- key must be
reserved for normal advancing through the unit.

A backout does not simply press the -back- key several times

---------- note 50 jump var
  02/27     13.52     friedman       csa

I just realized something else that the old jumpout
allowed us, that does not seem to available with the new:
the ability to jump to a unit whose name is stored in a
variable; in particular, a unit in the same lesson. This
is sort of an odd case of the old jumpout, and has only
occasional use; but...?
I use it extensively in the following situation: A help-
type key is to enter a "help" sequence which is actually
a separate lesson. So, the help-unit saves the current
value of baseu and jumpouts to the "help" lesson. On return
from the "help" lesson, the main lesson does a jumpout to
itself at the unit whose name was saved (the former value of 
baseu).?
Is there some other way to do this? The help-type key can
be a term, so the unit requesting help is completely
unpredictable.?
(More in 1st response)

---------- response 1
  02/27     13.59     friedman       csa

I'm not sure a "jumpout reture,return" is the answer,
because on return, the unit after the jumpout is now the
base unit (isn't it?), so we still have the problem of
getting back to what WAS the base unit before the jumpout.?
What is needed is the ability to jump to a unit whose
identification (not absolutely necessary that it be the
alphabetic name) is stored in a variable. (This identifi-
cation, if not alphabetic, would be the value of baseu or
a similar system variable; but it would have to be constant
even if a re-condense has taken place.) I know this sounds
messy--what other choice do we have?

Thanks, Parello, but that won't do it. The point is that
back1 won't do anything useful, since on return from the
"help" lesson, we are in a base sequence (like it or not) 
because the lesson has just "begun" (as far as plato knows).

Dave, your suggestion should take care of this case
admirably. I would probably code something like
jumpout lesson,¬on1¬1
where "lesson" is my lesson name, and n1 contains the
desired unit name (saved from baseu). Thanks.

Perhaps a systems clarification of the a_ctual=_ policy on

that if it is systems policy that there is to be (in 203b)
ABSOLUTELY NO GAME playing, and if systems people wish to
leave the games on the system for demo purposes, access to
those games s_hould=_ be restricted to those in appropriate
systems or systems-related courses. However, if the ac_tual =_ 
policy is that game-playing and games-authoring are ok
during certain hours, those hours should be set and made
known to games authors and users.

Systems people must realize the educational benefit of

considered taking game lessons off PLATO.

condone game playing in rooms 203b or 257 which annoys
students or authors! We admit that we have been unable to
enforce our rules, but we don't have to like the infractions
         Also, we cannot condone stealing lesson spaces from
other users in order to write new games. (this is the usual 
reason for changing codewords) And in a time of very scarce
disk space, we cannot accept your diverting space obtained
ostensibly for some high priority use to more games.
         With those exceptions, I second Judy Sherwood's

Please don't get the impression that Todd is the only
one who is making all the fuss........all three of us
are just a little tired of seeing changed edit codes and
strange notes in our lessons.... and, to me, verbal abuse 
by a systems person strikes the upper limit of my
patience. Of course, I can see that the student is 
the most important aspect of PLATO; otherwise none of
us would be here. But how can one successfully cope
with the day-to-day changes on the system and at the
same time be constantly harassed by a somewhat vehement
game-hater?
Don't get me wrong.....I understand the problems
currently facing the system, and I can see how some of
you must feel.....but I think it is important not to
forget how some of us feel who are in the middle of
this new experience!

Just to get in my 2(late) cents worth:

It would be helpful if persons leaving notes about the
actions of some specific member of the staff would name
the "subject in question". Refering to the system staff
in a nameless-faceless manner can only harden the "them
and us" attitudes forming between users and systems.

To the list -jumpout-, -from-, -lesson-, and 'router',
should we add -course-? Since it is a command whose
contents are assigned to a variable for various sorts of
manipulations, I assume it would be affected by new
file naming schemes.

---------- response 1

Perhaps course names are somewhat different from lesson
names, in that they may last only for a few months, etc.
Presumably operational lessons would not have -course-
commands in them, since such lessons would not fit
in with use at many different institutions and under many
different routers.

  Bruce, the CC English group is in the process of writing
a router for the Language Arts Curriculum, which is to be
field-tested in September at several different institutions
in September. Each institution will have its own curric-
ulum, thanks to John Risken's Curriculum Management System.
However, each institution, and possibly each instructor,
will have their own course. AT any rate, ALL courses
will be attached to the same router lesson; was this
multiple attachment capability not intended to be used
after it was created?
  So far, the only concrete reason that systems has given
to justify the (proposed) restrictions on the jumpout com-
mand concern the fact that an automatic conversion cannot
be done on algorithmically constructed lesson names. The
conventions to be used for naming lessons in the future
are irrelevant. (cont)

---------- response 3
  03/01     11.02     michael       english

Instead of restricting the jumpout command, and all other
commands and system variables that have to be rewritten
simply for an automatic conversion to take place, why can-
not we, the curriculum builders -- who are the ones integ-
rally affected by such restrictions -- bear the onus of
changing the contents of our common lists by hands to conform
to the new conventions when they are created? At least let
us do this in router lesson; as John has already said,
let us pick our own poison.
  Sometimes I am not sure that the systems staff realizes
the impact that certain changes which they make have upon
well-developed, sophisticated programs. How would they
be affected if their -readom- command was changed so as
to make variables illegal in the tag field?

 That was not my question-- I would like to know if you

specifically. We have some lessons where the student could
step thru some code "slowly", "rapidly" or "one line
at a time"---and there is a -pause v1- with v1=3,0,-1
respectively.

If this cannot be restored i will have to use a conditional

-pause-; not very efficient, I think......

Given the extra use of room 203b in the near future--as per
note ¬$90, could we get an upgrading of the enforcement of
the no games policy in 203b? An immediate suggestion for
improvement would be the removal from the room of anyone
playing a game. I am more than a little frustrated about
reports of game-players being told to desist, switching to
author mode (in one case at least to writing a game), then
switching back to the game after the operator, whom the 
student has had to summon, has gone back upstairs.?
Of course, this would be unnecessary if each game lesson
was required to have a site test in its ieu. When I
suggested this earlier, the only response(s) I got were:?
1. It would take too much space--The small number or word
involved would seem to be a necessary price.?
2. The lesson would have to be condensed to check the site--
true, but it wouldn't stay long.

now with the states "no games" policy.

Rick, I think we're all with you on the "no noise"
part, but does "student priority" mean authors have
second priority? This may cause problems, particularly
for authors under grants and contracts. If student
priority is necessary, perhaps is could only be in effect
8am to 10pm. While the details may be tricky to work out,
the spirit of the recommendation is quite commendable.
The simplistic value judgments that are sometimes applied
to "game" and other lessons of a non-standard teaching
nature are the basis of many previous proposals, which
have been less than optimum.

At 3:50 in the morning, in fact since 12:00 the previous
notes/replies make little sense... In room 203b, where
I am right now, there are at least 70: of the terminals
open... I don't think that a mandate is necessary to
regulate the usage of this room, or of any one site in
particular is necessary. From the hour of 10 pm on, one
has little trouble finding a terminal in most cases...
What is needed is a re-allocation of the working hours
that some people use: I have always worked at this hour
(or at least from 10 on) because:
a) I can get more work done with less hassle
b) I don't get deleted because of ecs shortages
c) I have homework to do first
True, my sleeping hours are a bit strange, but I can get
more accomplished a better percent of the time...
So instead of rationing the prime hours, lets re-allocate
the lost ones... true it may inconvenience some, but

---------- response 5

let's look at it this way:
1) the students MUST have access when scheduled .
2) When there is a class, or a group of students operating,
it becomes ridiculous to test lessons (especially when there
are several different curricula and their associated
on)
3) There is all this open time in the dead hours of the
night when there are no students that need priority.
(they leave soon after the first experimental plato arrives,
or when the janitor cleans at 11:00)
So, lets not dream for ecs during prime time, USE it
on the graveyard shift!!!

Again, and before the multitudes come crashing down with
complaints of how it will mess up their schedules, sleep,
etc.. this I realize; however, this is only a suggestion
it's what I do, and it has worked for me....

At this hour of the morning, the problem is obviously NOT
ECS nor is it likely to be open terminals. There is still,
however, too high a probability that a student who attempts
to study at this time will be unable to concentrate as well
as he would like because of the noise generated primarily by
game-players (shouts of triumph, dismay, etc.). I do not
accuse all game-players of this, nor do I claim this always
occurs, but I have seen it too often to ignore it. This is
the reason I favor Rick's "no noise" regulation. (I
am interpreting the priority given to students as being
priority for unscheduled students over game-players.)?
I believe there is less use (at least by students) during
the early am hours due to the 10pm 2am test period. (Not a
complaint about testing, just an opinion about explanation
of decline in student use at this time.)

OK, I made a reply to the note concerning lack of ability
to author because of the author-room problem... I agree
totally that there should be some kind of noise pollution
restriction in 203b... but I think that the reply given by
Mr. Mckeown misses the point I made: that there is a lot
of open time from 10 on when you _can_ author without fear
of insanity/deletion, and that this time could be made use
of by the voluntary restriction of authoring at peak student
load times... This is not to mean that there should be a
plato classroom patrol that throws authors/students/game
players out based on a rigid set of hours... It is up to
all of us to make things as conducive to education as

help note 295 revives the old problem of how to prevent a
" charset is loading" message from flashing by the student
who already has it loaded. Could we have a command such as
 
charflg lesson, charset $$ "charflg" = charset flag

...which sets -error- to -1 because it is not loaded, and
to 0 if it is.

earlier suggestions that reserve words be created which tell 
us what charset is loaded have not been acted on, i assume
reasons exist for this and i'm hoping the -charflg- idea
might get done because it can borrow existing code from the 
-charset- command.

I am puzzild. I thought that once-upon-a-time a full-screen
erase (-erase- command with blank tag, or a -jump-) cut
off any screen output generated just before the erase.
In that case the sequence (in the initial entry unit)

at     1215 
write  Now loading characters....
charset  zonk,zip
erase

would prevent the message from flashing on the screen if
the charset had already been loaded. That certainly does
not happen now, which makes in the handling of the full-
screen erase.......?

---------- response 2
  03/03     16.56     bob y       r1

that's exactly the problem, bruce, there have been at least
two changes over the past 3-4 months which have affected
the way in which output is aborted when a full screen
erase is coming.

each time i've caught the 'charset is loanding' message
slipping past, i've found a new way to program around it.
but it keeps coming back to haunt me, and, what's worse,
to confuse the kindergarten kids we're running.

i'd like to see something done in this area which will
be reliable. using the 'aborted output' method seems to
me to be a somewhat sophisticated method of dealing with
a rather trivial problem.

---------- note 152 systems
  03/02     10.15     john r       r1

TUTOR has made another great leap! People who
used a timed, keylocked pause and checked for key=timeup
after the pause will now have to add an additional check
to make sure that the duration of the pause was not =0.
To have to do this seems logically inconsistent since
'timeup' ought always to be the signal that  timing  is
complete.

Is there any rationale, systems people, for this change?
If there is no rationale, will it be fixed. (noted, by the
wat that I have no programs affected by this at this moment;
my concern is that TUTOR seems to be somewhat less
straightforward becouse of it. sine much time has been
strings come to mind), it seems strange to see activity
that moves in the opposite direction)

---------- response 1
  03/03     03.35     blomme       s

   The performance of the command can be adjusted various
ways; it does not seem specially obvious (to me) that
if one is processing a key and it " goes through" a pause 0
that the key should mystically disappear and be replaced
by a timeup key on the other side of the pause. If that
is indeed the only mode that is useful and makes sense
to people, we will change it--I think that either way
will need some careful documentation in aids.

---------- response 2
  03/03     11.00     b sherwood       s

My impression is that "pause 0" was wanted by people who
were setting a flag to -1, 0 or some positive number in
order to run a program in a step, continuous, or slowed
mode. Note also that key cannot be set to " timeup" in
the case fo "pause -1", since after a blank pause you get
command). So setting key to " timeup" after "pause 0" would
not be consistent to setting key to the student key after
"pause -1".

---------- response 3
  03/03     14.01     john r       r1

But with a negative or a positive tag the effect of
-pause- is to alter 'key'. Thus -pause 0- _is_ anomalous.

---------- response 4
  03/03     21.11     blomme       s

   WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT???!!!
After timing has occurred you are no longer processing
the oringinal key pressed by the student--the "key" that
causes processing next is a system created one due to the
timing being completed and the mnemonic "timeup" was
selected for this key. I thought everyone realized that
a " pause 1" was both a signal for completion of processing
of the current key as well as a request for a 1 second
delay before resumption of processing. Because the option
of doing this sort of operation via a " time 1" and "pause"
is available, it is essential that th system created " key"
signaling completion of timing be identifiable by the
author to distinguish it from a student generated one.
As I indicated before, any and all situations (whether
felt to be " strange" or not) related to timing should be 
documented in aids.

It would appear that anybody with a "pause v1" in his
program expects the value of "key" to be the system
defined value of "timeup" afterwards--and, as John says, not
have to worry about special checks for v1=0.

Seriously, we have a definite strong prejudice against
adding additional commands to be embedded in the -write-
statement. The syntax gets very complicated and the
statements get hard to read. This affects the efficiency
of the condensing process, too. Most of us continue to
be very puzzled by the popularity of some embedding
features. For example, most system programmers wouldn't
dream of embedding an initial -at-, since it reduces
readability, flexibility, and editability, yet we notice
that "write ¬oat,1215¬1 See the dog!" is a very popular
form. Why is it so popular?

For one thing, Bruce, disk space"--embeds use less disk
space in the source code. Of course, they also use _more_
disk space after being condensed, i.e., in ECS, but....

Perhaps aids should emphasize that embeds cost in ECS
space; also, aids could mention real reason for having
embeds, which is, I understand (correct me if I'm wrong),
for ease in creating wrong-answer messages in one write
so that they will erase after a no-judgement.

I had what I thought was a very good reason for suggesting
the embeded pause. Correct me if you disagree.

 When writing a large paragraph, it is frequently desired
to present it a sentence or concept at a time. (P) Humans
like plato can only process a certain amout of information
in any given time frame. And humans like plato get 'grumpy'
when asked to process more than that limit. (P) When authors
try to fix that using a series of at, write, pauses, it
gets messy. (P) I just went through a lesson and changed a
couple of paragraphs to implement this, and although
it now works, its hard to read and nearly impossible to
edit.

---------- response 10
  03/04     12.11     deiss       pharmacy

Let me put it another way:
     When a good speaker presents information to an audience
he makes effective use of all the cues he has at his
disposal to direct the listeners attention to various
portions of his message. He gets the emphosis on the
right sylabble (by changes of pitch,mood,volume, etc.).
With plato we have similar control over the visual
dimensions of the stimulus (location,size,rotation,etc.).
I think an embeded pause would give us a more easily
used and more directly understood analogue to those
things the speaker uses that are time dependent (changes
in meter, rhythm, etc.).

As part of an answer to Bruce's question about embedding
at, I find it very useful for conditional statements, when
different messages go at different locations. This can
be done without embedding but seems much more elegant in
one writec command.

Also, what was the outcome of the discussion on replacing
the R on the index page with the number of replies? Such
a thing would be real handy on notes like this one.

Jim--The people responsible for notes haven't done anything
about better feedback (better than "R"), that's what.

As to the embedded pause: I can see that within your own
framework it looks nice; however, it doesn't appear to have
wide use--and would add even more clutter to current ideas
of what TUTOR is. It would seem that most people in fact
manage this timing now. Think about it--first a pause--
then you want to be able to do something with the key that
comes in (like branch)--which means you wanted to do some
calculations--which means you wanted to embed whole units
worth of stuff in the write statement, and branch (out of
the write statement, sometimes, of course) accordingly.

I don't know about you, but it sounds like a bad dream to
me--and we have no intention of opening this version of
Pandorra's box!

I can't believe that, the arrow went up a line! Well,
it seems to be back to normal, maybe it was a transmission
error? Anyway, where was I....
The obsession authors have with embeds is due to the fact
that 1)embeds take up less room in a block, 2)embeds
are easier than remembering to put an -at- or whatever on
the previous line.
So, embeds do have a purpose...

SD and SS are not going to execute embedded or other

Nobody EVER intended to question the use of embedded

The other embed features were added (-at- and -mode-) were
added at the request of authors.

and/or -mode- make programming much easier. However, as

On the "type the name of your course" page, may I suggest
that this read something like "type your course". Our
students are confused by the "type your name" and
"type the name..." which appear on different frames.
Thus when they see the "name not in course" message
they are a bit confused as to which "name."

This will be done...if I have to do it myself.
Indeed...it should exist for ALL branch type commands...

One way I have thought of to add it to the language is...
by placing a * after a variable branch command...
e.g.,
         jump*   n1
         next*   n1
         help*   n1

The coding you suggest reminds me strongly of 
naming conventions used in PLATO III....

(Also, I don't think that cookies would be a proper
bribe for this feat of programming.... name your

that the time in coding around this problem would
be worth a considerable amount of, say, fannie mae

Paul:
     Instead of creating a new jump etc. (jump*) why not
use jump ¬0expression¬1 as is similar to computed gotos
in many other languages. Then the command used would be the
same but the ¬0¬1 syntax would flag the condensor to do its
special stuff. P.S. - would this command necessitate
saving a unit jump table in the tutor execution code?

---------- response 8
  03/06     16.07     emg       mtcc

Paul: The way this is being handled in the CAMIL language
is by the use of PROCEDURE type variables which can take
on effec??ively the names of procedures as their value.
Since you do not have typed variables as such why not
just make a calc command form such as
calc  n1?xxxxxx
where xxxxxx is a unit name, and then a command
such as jump n1 could be condensed such
that n1 would be interpreted as containing the compiled
form(or a reference through a table of unit names
encountered as xxxxxx type tags so you would only have to
store names of units which might be referenced in this way)
of a unit name. The xxxxxx form could use some type of
quotes so that it would not be interpreted as a normal
alpha character string.
In this way any of the existing mechanisms which are
appropriate might be used to compute "unit name values"
which could then be used in jumps.

Bruce,
Thanks for the rapid reponse to my last suggestion.
But I am afraid the example course name will cause more
confusion than clarity. In Vet. Med. we have only one
PLATO course for all of our students, but several of the

academic courses use PLATO material. Students will not be
certain about what to use as a course name. I would guess
most other users have the a similar situation.

I have noticed somewhat the same problem, stemming from
the fact that a PLATO "course" does not necessarily
have a one-to-one correspondence with a university course.
This is a general PLATO-terminology problem.

Seems to be a minor bug in the micro-table editor.
I noticed it while in lesson cslibrary, block pl1, in
inspect-only mode.?
While in inspect-only mode, enter micro block and press
DATA to edit. On the main micro-editing page, press a key
and the editor shows the current micro, but of course, it
does not invite you to change it. Now press NEXT and the
bug shows up: you are shown a page having only the word
FONT on it. From here, the only thing I tried that did
anything useful was to press BACK; this returns you
properly to the editor block display page.

If "index" is defined as a segmented variable:
store n(index) $$ works ok
but
store v(index) $$ gets a segment condense error
also:
transfr n1;common,loc;length

gets execution error "bad length" if loc references
ecs location outside declared common bounds...
can't length error be distinguished from loc error?

---------- response 1

You are correct; the first appears to be an error, and we
will fix it; for the -transfer- command, it is true that if
your ecs beginning address is bad, you get a "bad length"

error--it is in fact quite easy to give you another message,
and I will do so. Thanks.

---------- response 2

Don't be too sure of getting the first thing fixed.
Segments are stored as integers(what form would one choose
for a 12 bit floating point number?) and flagging this as
a condense error is probably better than automatically
rounding to an integer.

I accept your apology (possibly on behalf of someone else),
and this is not written in anger or bitterness, BUT
I would think that a system such as this would automatically
set a deadstart immediately after as major a change as was
made this weekend. ?
For information purposes: I had to request a reload of the
older version (see note ¬$225). This is reasonable, but the
version which had to be loaded will not accept *specs*
bumpshift. This, of course, causes the *specs* command to
be ignored and caused execution errors in many lessons and
incorrect results in others. It happened, of course, on the
night before an exam. (I have spent the last 1.5 hours
deleting specs noshift.)

To David Frankel or David AndersEn

It sure would be nice if there were a sort of half-space

would find such an option useful for typing phonetic
characters that often require diacritics (at an arrow).
Working without such a key necessitates subversion of the

It seems to me that since such a device already exists
in a format even easier than "talk" (namely, just trying
to sign on under whatever records you want to test), this
is not a valid objection. I find the current scheme frus-

I'd like to add my vote for some kind of alphabetization
scheme, and also some way of dividing course records into
'class sections' for those of us who must run several
distinct student groups in one course. This could be
solved by allowing the author to enter markers in the
list of students associated with course, eg. section1
section2, etc., to access student records beginning at
certain markers, and to alphabetize starting from certain
markers. It would also be nice if student records could
be accessed by student name instead of student number.
Frequently one has to fish through a long list of
students to find the one he wants to edit. What say yee?

locate,markx,funct...etc.).  Now that the line to
Valparaiso has FINALLY gotten installed, Don Shirer will

The timeslice problems here are well-known, so you need
not report them any more.....If you are still having
the same problems in 2-3 weeks, then it is time to start
reporting specific bugs again.

In that far-distant day when the course records editor is
streamlined, how about making it remember the format of
displaying student variables between students?  Then you'd
only have to change the format once for inspecting a bunch
of students.

---------- note 272  algebra
  03/05     16.06     b sherwood       s

It used to be that if you defined "kg", "kgs", and "s"
and the student wrote "kg s" this response was incorrectly
taken to mean "kgs" rather than "kg?s".  This is now fixed.

Also, if you defined "newtons" (maximum 7 characters) and
the student wrote "newtons meter" or "newtonsmeter" the
characters after the 7th character were totally ignored.
This too is now fixed.

i received a strange message while in the editor tonight.

i had backed out of the lesson george and had been on the
author mode page for approximately ten minutes.  when i
attempted to re-enter my lesson, i received the message
"non-editable file."

another person of my course checked the course records.
the records had me listed as editting george, which i
was not really editting.

   Only of the message--it is typically issued when the
lesson directory is or looks to be fouled up; in particular
if the word describing the file type indicates that it
is not a tutor lesson. An inspection of the disk storage
for that lesson showed it to be ok--assume you will not
have any (more) trouble.

To all users of Dial Up Channels:

        There are at the present only 8 dial up ports
which are used by a large number of users including
system people on important live domonstrations.  It is
there for important that these dial up ports not be locked
up by users who are not actively operating their terminals.
When a port is locked up by an inactive, terminal there is
one fewer port for the remaining users to compete and as
a result some users are unable to operate.  Please stop








this practice as if it is continued, some sort of system
timeout or auto hang-up will have to be implemented.  If
there is a particular reason for reserving a dial-up port

it.

specified (i.e., an offset value of either 0, or greater
than the length) is a mistake on the author's part, thus
an execution error should result.

        The routine does allow an immediate abort with -1

a zero object length.

Yes, in this case there is an explaination.

Students get to unit embdorm of lesson morphogen. This
unit becomes their main unit. From their they goto unit
prelet (block n) which does a restart (blank tag).
Thus they are restarted in morphogen,embdorm.

help note 295 revives the old problem of how to prevent a
"charset is loading" message from flashing by the student
who already has it loaded. Could we have a command such as

charflg lesson,charset $$ "charflg" = charset flag

...which sets -error- to -1 because it is not loaded, and
to 0 of it is.

earlier suggestions that reserve words be created which tell
us what charset is loaded have not been acted on. i assume
reasons exist for this and i'm hoping the -charflg- idea
might get done because it can borrow existing code from the
-charset- command.

---------- response 1
  03/03     11.38     b sherwood       s

I am puzzled. I thought that once-upon-a-time a full-screen
erase (-erase- command with blank tag, or a -jump-) cut
off any screen output generated just before the erase.
In that case the sequence (in the initial entry unit)

   at       1215
   write    Now loading characters....
   charset  zonk,zip
   erase

would prevent the message from flashing on the screen if
the charset had already been loaded. That certainly does
not happen now, which makes me wonder whether we have made
some unintentional change in the handling of the full-
screen erase.......?

---------- response 2
  03/03     16.56     bob y       r1

that's exactly the problem, bruce. there have been at least
two changes over the past 3-4 months which have affected
the way in which output is aborted when a full screen
erase is coming.

each time i've caught the 'charset is loading' message
slipping past, i've found a new way to program around it.
but it keeps coming back to haunt me, and, what's worse,
to confuse the kindergarten kids we're running.

i'd like to see something done in this area which will
be reliable. using the 'aborted output' method seems to
me to be a somewhat sophisticated method of dealing with
a rather trivial problem.

block! That block happens to be -use-d by two other
lessons and contains the define set for both, so you
got me up at 9 a.m. on Saturday after I go to bed
at 4 a.m. on Friday, to fix 2 ruined lessons. Just a short
note to let you know...

To Blomme; I am putting this note in general notes because
there is no room in help.

  Sorry--most of the people involved in this conversion
were going into their 2nd day without sleep by the time
it was over...no one was anticipating "used" block problems
by that time. Quite frankly we are overjoyed that (as yet)
no strange incompatibility has reared its head.

I, too, am sorry...I suppose if I hadn't changed the block
name in some lessons, I would have been yelled at for
changing somebody's lesson and not leaving a note telling
what it was that I did...and one of the reasons I wanted to
do the conversion on a weekend was so that if any problems
came up, there would still be time for authors to fix them
before classes on monday. I am sorry if you lost some
sleep due to my error.

TUTOR has made another great leap! People who
used a timed, keylocked pause and checked for key=timeup
after the pause will now have to add an additional check
to make sure that the duration of the pause was not = 0.
To have to do this seems logically inconsistent since
'timeup' ought always to be the signal that timing is
complete.

Is there any rationale, systems people, for this change?
If there is no rationale, will it be fixed. (note, by the
wat that I have no programs affected by this at this moment;
my concern is that TUTOR seems to be somewhat less
straightforward because of it. since much time has been
spent in the past making things more consistent (character
strings come to mind), it seems strange to see activity
that moves in the opposite direction)

---------- response 1
  03/03     03.35     blomme       s

   The performance of the command can be adjusted various
ways; it does not seem specially obvious (to me) that
if one is processing a key and it "goes through" a pause 0
that the key should mystically disappear and be replaced
by a timeup key on the other side of the pause. If that
is indeed the only mode that is useful and makes sense
to people, we will change it--I think that either way
will need some careful documentation in aids.

---------- response 2
  03/03     11.00     b sherwood       s

My impression is that "pause 0" was wanted by people who
were setting a flag to -1, 0 or some positive number in
order to run a program in a step, continuous, or slowed
mode. Note also that key cannot be set to "timeup" in
the case of "pause -1", since after a blank pause you get
the key the student typed (assuming there was no -time-
command). So setting key to "timeup" after "pause 0" would
not be consistent to setting key to the student key after
"pause -1".

---------- response 3
  03/03     14.01     john r       r1

But with a negative or a positive tag the effect of
-pause- is to alter 'key'. Thus -pause 0- _is_ anomalous.

---------- response 4
  03/03     21.11     blomme       s

   WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT???!!!
After timing has occurred you are no longer processing
the original key pressed by the student--the "key" that
causes processing next is a system created one due to the
timing being completed and the mnemonic "timeup" was
selected for this key. I thought everyone realized that
a "pause 1" was both a signal for completion of processing
of the current key as well as a request for a 1 second
delay before resumption of processing. Because the option
of doing this sort of operation via a "time 1" and "pause"
is available, it is essential that the system created "key"
signaling completion of timing be identifiable by the
author to distinguish it from a student generated one.
As I indicated before, any and all situations (whether
felt to be "strange" or not) related to timing should be
documented in aids.

It would appear that anybody with a "pause v1" in his
program expects the value of "key" to be the system
defined value of "timeup" afterwards--and, as John says, not
have to worry about special checks for v1=0.

This is a tiny thing, but it gets time-consuming.
I would like to be able to get a print-out of my
course records in order to determine how much time
each student has spent and how much total time
was devoted by students to work in my course (sfw).
However, this is considered an "improper request,"
so at the end of each quarter I have to copy all the
figures by hand. Why is requesting a course print-out
improper? Thank you...

   As options continue to be added to the print routine,
the ability to distinguish courses and do something with
regard to printing them will occur. Exactly what info
can/should be made available is subject to some debate.

"Sorry, we have not yet built a 'printer of course

by Jim Ghesquire about the new format of AIDS: I preferred
the old format. With this format, I find myself looking
through the many different indeces, just to find what I
want. The announcements on the first page are an
excellent idea but I would much prefer having one index
with basically all of the choices to having 3 or 4
indeces.

Time slice error in lesson data (reproducible):

join seq: listx5?
I was looking for execution erros on comdata and had
gone into option 5, pressed 2, then j. then next to get
back to main option page. Pressing next on main option
page consistently causes error.?
Another problem with data collection: I am getting display
of area commands showing 46 arrows, ok/no/u-no 46-0-9, but
ok 1st try 0. This seems impossible to me. The ok 1st try
appears to be inoperable. A random sample of area command
output in the file showed no non-zero ok 1st try. Also some
strange output from area commands. search for student
seremek. or stephan (shows 203 terms).?
A minor point about the operation of option 5: Why when
I am switching on data search option e will it automatically
switch on f and g (I see the reason for that), but when
switching off e it leaves f and g on?

how the notes program is setup, I went to write a new note

went to store it it said (NO ROOM). _Now_ I know what to do
when the notes are full. But if the file is full, people
should not have access to the note-writing page. If someone
has a long complex note to write + finds out when theyre
done that it cant be stored,...well you know what theyll

Is that recursive?

Seriously, we have a definite strong prejudice against
adding additional commands to be embedded in the -write-
statement. The syntax gets very complicated and the
statements get hard to read. This affects the efficiency
of the condensing process, too. Most of us continue to
be very puzzled by the popularity of some embedding
features. For example, most system programmers wouldn't
dream of embedding an initial -at-, since it reduces
readability, flexibility, and editability, yet we notice
that "write ¬0at,1215¬1 See the dog!" is a very popular
form. Why is it so popular?

---------- response 7
  03/04     10.36     friedman       csa

For one thing, Bruce, disk space!--embeds use less disk
space in the source code. Of course, they also use _more_
disk space after being condensed, i.e., in ECS, but....

Perhaps aids should emphasize that embeds cost in ECS
space; also, aids could mention real reason for having
embeds, which is, I understand (correct me if I'm wrong),
for ease in creating wrong-answer messages in one write
so that they will erase after a no-judgement.

---------- response 8

That is certainly a nice use of embedding; another good

have ¬0s,v21¬1 apples...(etc.)

I had what I thought was a very good reason for suggesting
the embedded pause. Correct me if you disagree.

When writing a large paragraph, it is frequently desired
to present it a sentence or concept at a time. (P) Humans
like plato can only process a certain amout of information
in any given time frame. And humans like plato get 'grumpy'
when asked to process more than that limit. (P) When authors
try to fix that using a series of at, write, pauses, it
gets messy. (P)  i just went through a lesson and changed a
couple of paragraphs to implement this, and although
it now works, its hard to read and nearly impossible to
edit.

---------- response 10
  03/04     12.11     deiss       pharmacy

Let me put it another way:
     When a good speaker presents information to an audience
he makes effective use of all the cues he has at his
disposal to direct the listeners attention to various
portions of his message. He gets the emphosis on the
right sylabble (by changes of pitch,mood,volume, etc.).
With plato we have similar control over the visual
dimensions of the stimulus (location,size,rotation,etc.).
I think an embeded pause would give us a more easily
used and more directly understood analogue to those
things the speaker uses that are time dependent (changes
in meter, rhythm, etc.).

As part of an answer to Bruce's question about embedding
at, I find it very useful for conditional statements, when
different messages go at different locations. This can
be done without embedding but seems much more elegant in
one writec command.

Also, what the outcome of the discussion on replacing
the R on the index page with the number of replies? Such
a thing would be real handy on notes like this one.

Jim--The people responsible for notes haven't done anything
about better feedback (better than "R"), that's what.

As to the embedded pause: I can see that within your own
framework it looks nice; however, it doesn't appear to have
wide use--and would add even more clutter to current ideas
of what TUOR is. It would seem that most people in fact
manage this timing now. Think about it--first a pause--
then you want to be able to do something with the key that
comes in (like branch)--which means you wanted to do some
calculations--which means you wanted to embed whole units
worth of stuff in the write statement, and branch (out of
the write statement, sometimes, of course) accordingly.

I don't know about you, but it sounds like a bad dream to
me--and we have no intention of opening this version of
Pandorra's box!

The obsession authors have with embeds has come about
for the love of mike! What is going on here?
I can't believe that, the arrow went up a line! Well,
it seems to be back to normal, maybe it was a transmission
error? Anyway, where was I....
The obsession authors have with embeds is due to the fact
that 1)embeds take up less room in a block, 2)embeds
are easier than remembering to put an -at- or whatever on
the previous line.
So, embeds do have a purpose...
Although I am not saying it is necessary, in SD and SS
allowing embeds would make it easier to display what is
already encoded in your block.

SD and SS are not going to execute embedded or other

variables during execution. The question relates to
embedded -at-s, and those aren' going to be done, either.

Nobody EVER intended to question the use of embedded

The other embed features were added (-at- and -mode-) were
added at the request of authors.

      I agree that there are places where embedded -at-
and/or -mode- make programming much easier. However, as
one whose purpose in life is helping other people find
programming mistakes, I DON'T LIKE THEM. It is soooo
much easier to find that nasty -mode erase- if the -mode-

Paul:
     Instead of creating a new jump etc. (jump*) why not
use jump ¬0expression¬1 as is similar to computed gotos
in many other languages.Then the command used would be the
same but the ¬0¬1 syntax would flag the condensor to do its
special stuff. P.S. - would this command necessitate
saving a unit jump table in the tutor execution code?

Paul: The way this is being handled in the CAMIL language
is by the use of PROCEDURE type variables which can take
on effec??ively the names of procedures as their value.
Since you do not have typed variables as such why not
just make a calc command from such as
calc n1?xxxxxx
where xxxxxx is a unit name, and then a command
such as jump n1 could be condensed such
that n1 would be interpreted as containing the compiled
form(or a reference through a table of unit names
encounterd as xxxxxx type tags so you would only have to
store names of units which might be referenced in this way)
of a unit name. The xxxxxx form could use some type of
quotes so that it would not be interpreted as a normal
alpha character string.
In this way any of the existing mechanisms which are
appropriate might be used to compute "unit name values"
which could then be used in jumps.

Bruce,
        Thanks for the rapid reponse to my last suggestion.
But I am afraid the example course name will cause more
confusion than clarity. In Vet. Med. we have only one
PLATO course for all of our students, but several of the
academic courses use PLATo material. Students will not be
certain about what to use as a course name. I would guess
most other users have the a similar situation.

I have noticed somewhat the same problem, stemming from

have a one-to-one correspondence with a university course.
This is a general PLATO-terminology problem.

Seems to be a minor bug in the micro-table editor.
I noticed it while in lesson cslibrary, block pl1, in
inspect-only mode.?
While in inspect-only mode, enter micro block and press
DATA to edit. On the main micro-editing page, press a key
and the editor shows the current micro. but of course, it
does not invite you to change it. Now press NEXT and the
bug shows up:  you are shown a page having only the word
FONT on it. From here, the only thing I tried that did
anything useful was to press BACK; this returns you
properly to the editor block display page.

       also:

You are correct; the first appears to be an error, and we

your ecs beginning address is bad' you get a "bad length"
error--it is in fact quite easy to give you another message,

Don't be too sure of getting the first thing fixed.
Segments are stored as integers(what form would one choose
for a 12 bit floating point number?) and flagging this as
a condense error is probably better than automatically
rounding to an integer.

I accept your apology (possibly on behalf of someone else),

I would think that a system such as this would automatically
set a deadstart immediately after as major a change as was
made this weekend.?
For information purposes: I had to request a reload of the
older version (see note ¬$225).This is reasonable, but the
version which had to be loaded, will not accept *specs*
bumpshift. This, of course, causes the *specs* command to 
be ignored and caused execution errors in many lessons and
incorrect results in others. It happened, of course, on the
night before an exam. (I have spent the last 1.5 hours

to sign on under whatever records you want to test). this
is not a valid objection. I find the current scheme frus-

I'd like to add my vote for some kind of alphabetization

'class sections' for those of us who must run several
distinct student groups in one course. This could be
solved by allowing the author to enter markers in the
list of students associated with a course, eg. section1
sections2, etc., to access student records beginning at
certain markers, and to alphabetize starting from certain
markers. It would also be nice if student records could 
be accessed by student name instead of student number.
Frequently one has to fish through a long list of 
students to find the one he wants to edit. What say yee?

To all users of Dial Up channels:

    There are at the present only 8 dial up ports 
which are used by a large number of users including 
system people on important live demonstrations. It is 
therefor important that these dial up ports not be locked
up by users who are not actively operating their terminals.
When a port is locked up by an inactive terminal there is
one fewer port for the remaining users to compete and as
a result some users are unable to operate. Please stop
this practice as if it is continued, some of system
timeout or auto hang-up will have to be implemented. If
there is a particular reason for reserving a dial-up port
(important demo etc.) you should contact CERL to arrange
it.

First of all, SD doesn't handle RDRAW yet.
Second of all, I have to fix ID! I never created an
RDRAW with more than 63 arguments. I will fix this soon.
By the way, the first Rdraw is correct, isn't it??
And things work if you change the draw to an rdraw??
Or is the RDRAW that was generated wrong?
Sorry for the trouble...

What does it mean to generate a coarse grid -rdraw- ? I
can kind of see where it might be useful, but when I went
into coarse grid mode, I only wanted to move the cursor
quickly, not actually generate coarse grid references. My
error there. Sorry about thinking that SD took -rdraw-,
though.

By the way, if you ever want to think about it, I wonder
if the keys used in ID could not be more meaningful:
LAB for this, + for that, and ? for whatchamacallit gets 
awful confusing. Or maybe it's just my problem.

keys were used, so I tried real hard (like m for microfiche)
and finally gave up.

In putting terminals in individual classrooms, we have
found it important that the teacher be able to specify
the order of student access and the on-times for terminals.
The most convenient way to do this is to have each terminal
revert to a passive monitor state when a student is through,
leaving the name of the next person on the screen, or
leaving a you-can't-use-me-now message until the next
ON period begins. We have programs that do this (as long
as nobody shift-stops), but they necessitate leaving
the last user's records attached to the terminal; if the 
system crashes, that student's current status is lost - even
though he was really done 30 minutes earlier. Do any of you
systems people have any ideas for ways to preserve the 
monitor state and yet protect the records of the user?

---------- response 1
  03/06     13.59     michael       english

Would check-pointing solve the crash problem, John? Still,
what you are ultimately asking for is a system level
lesson which would allow site directors to allocate their
terminal usage on-line, some sort of scheduler particular
to a site which could be changed by the site director and 
which would be checked prior to allowing entry at that 
site. Personally, I feel that this should have high
priority. Any site directors agree?

To G. Michael: I don't _think_ that's waht I'm asking for
in this note.

Checkpointing would be using a sledge hammer to drive home
a thumbtack. Only one or two records need to be protected
at any given time, and there will be more than a dozen
courses running simultaneously. Maybe a -chkpnt- command
that could be executed only once per session - and that 
would disappear once the system stabilized?

A small bug in copy-a-block:

When you try to copy, but your security code is wrong,
the words "IMPROPER SECURITY CODE, are positioned too
far to the right, so that they overflow into the next

While you're about it, could you make it a bit easier
for people who recieve the "improper security code"
message while copying-a-block from one lesson with
one change code, to another lesson with a different one.
Currently one must enter the change code of the origin
lesson in the change code of the destination lesson,
then BACK OUT of the destination lesson, change one's
own security code to match, go back in, and do the copy.
Then change the change code back, back out again, change
one's own code again, and return. How about, either...

        a) An option to type in a security code on
           the copy-a-block page, or...
        b) An arrangement that changes an author's own
           security code to match the new change code of 
           a lesson?

       seem to recall that matching INSPECT codes used to

The next time plato is loaded, the feature Mr. Warner
suggested will be in. As to the worries about needing
the change code instead of the change or inspect, I
think that you CAN copy-a-block when all you have is the 
inspect code. And to Mr. Fuller: perhaps, instead of
TELLING me what I should do, you could merely SUGGEST
that something be put in -- In other words,

Just to keep the record straight:?
If a lesson has a zero inspect code, you can copy-a-block
from it to another lesson without knowing the change code.
But if the lesson has a (non-zero) inspect code, you
cannot. I agree that this does seem inconsistent.
(Sorry, my previous note about this was based on an
incomplete test.)?
Why NOT allow copy-a-block if the lesson being copied
into has the same change OR inspect code as either the
change OR inspect code of the lesson being copied from.
or if the lesson being copied from has a zero change
OR inspect code?

---------- response 11
  03/09     13.50     frankel       p

Sorry, I misunderstood the discussion about inspect codes 
matching...here's the way it works (now, at least):
The computer stores your security code in memory (and in 
your records). When you enter a lesson, it sees if that
security code matches either the inspect or change code
of the lesson you want to get into, and, depending on
what it finds, does (hopefully) the right thing.
When you copy a block, the computer once again checks 
the codewords of the copy-from lesson against the code-
word it has stored. If either match, you can proceed with
the copy. If they don't match, you can (now) type in
the security code of the copy-from lesson. So, there
is _no_ use of the codewords on the copy-into lesson.
Of course, a zero-code always matches the stored codeword.

I like the title option of the printer.
I would find it more useful, if if the very first
statement in the source is *list title, the title
would appear on the first page. It could then contain
the author name for printout distribution, etc.

Question: if I list the information from the 
data page, will it contain the codewords? I hope not?!

I'm glad you like the option. I'd hate to have to take it
out due to disinterest. The problem with doing what you
want is that by the time I read your *list title
command, I've already printed out the header. I'd have
to make a special pass through the lesson to find out
if the list requestor wants a title on the first page,
block a "partsed out", or a block directory before the 
lesson. I doubt if that overhead is worth it.

---------- note 29 shows(v1)
  03/06     16.22     rader       s

There has been discussion for some time about the desira-
bility of having the -shows- command show floationg point
numbers which in fact represent integers (frac(x)= 0)
as an integer (i.e., with no decimal point).

The effect of such a change on existing lessons is unkown;
however, it would probably benefit most lessons.

To give users a chance to look at this, there is now
available (right this very minute!) a special temporary
(test) version of -shows-, which you can reference by
writing "test" as the third argument. E.g.,
"shows x,4,test" will show an integer if frac(x) = 0.

Comments appreciated.

Would this be optional? If one is concerned about
significant figures, it is important to show those
extra zeros. 3?10^4 is not the same as 3.00?10^4.

Probably this should be the special case?

---------- response 4
  03/07     08.36     b sherwood       s

In fact, suppose only the one-argument -shows- dropped
the trailing zeros. The two-argument form would always
show the specified number of significant figures:

shows    v1      $$ if frac(v)=0, don't show fraction
shows    v1,4    $$ always show 4 significant figures

Would that do it?

---------- response 5
  03/07     10.40     rader       s

As to showing "3.500" as "3.5"--(I assume you want 3.512
to show as 3.512) that requires suppressing zeroes after
they have been generated, which is, of course, possible.

I would point out that if you have "3.500132", and you
do a "shows x", you will see "3.500"--now, do you want 
at this point to suppress the trailing zeroes (which may
appear irrelevant when you see them) and show "3.5"?

Note that if you have 3.000132, the proposed shows 
will still show you "3.000"---because "frac(x)" is not
zero.

---------- response 6
  03/07     11.05     rader       s

Here is a list of various ways that individuals would 
apparently like to show their numbers (in the context of 
-shows-): have I missed your point of view?

1. Show "n" significant digits.

2. Same as (1), but show "integers" as integers.
        (Where frac(x)=0 for an "integer".)

3. Same as (1), but suppress trailing zeroes (after they
        have been generated).

4. Same as (1), but show _at_ _most_ "m" decimal places.

5. Same as (4), but suppress trailing zeroes.

---------- response 7
  03/07     11.25     friedman       csa

How about--?
 0.  Same as (2), but let plato pick _n_ such that there 
     are neither leading nor trailing zeros.

---------- response 8
  03/08     16.23     rader       s
As a first step, note that you should use
"shows v1,4,0" as the "test" version...(Sorry about
that!)---using ,"test" as the third argument will give
you a condense error (or course?). Thanks to Elaine
Avner for mentioning this.

Corrections to the exposure level of individual frames of

have a such a list.

that I have no trouble with it, but I have been around

when in replace or insert mode,the editor displays

            Editor has hassles with nonexotic stuff
       as well.
       A very long tag - occupying, say, 2 1/2 or 3
       screen lines, tho not rejected by the editor
       (or condensor), doesn't display right in
       Insert or Replace. EDITOR doesn't seem to
       believe that a tag could be that long, and
       places arrow within the previous line display
       - in fact, it seems to even show the line
       after the one you're inserting sometimes!
            Nice as this last feature might be if
       consistently available, the irregularity
       would seem far simpler to remedy than CR boogie.

       How true!for example,
       when you want to have a long sentence under-
       lined,it appears in the insert or replace modes:
       hello,i am a example sentence and (blah,blah) ========_========_
would appear after insertion (or replacement) :
        hello,i am example ________ sentenceand
(or something to that extent)
        i think a cure for this might facilitate
        an easier cure for long CR tags.

The problem with text display in the editor is merely one
of our having compromised occasional aesthetics for speed.
As has been said before, the editor uses "showa"s--which
do not update the screen position correctly, to save a few
msecs/sec (this is important). In your own programs, you
can spend your money and use an embedded "showa", which
does keep track of the screen position.

Result: we are not likely to increase the cost of the
editor.

The underlining problem is something else again.

As to underlining, I suggest that long underlines be
done by rdraw, rather than by backspaces and underscores;
don't all those backspaces ¬+ underscores take up more
space (if more than a few of then, anyway) than an
rdraw? I mean, space in ECS as well as on disk?

As to "skipping", the step machinery does exactly what you
want it to do. "s 12" makes the step machine execute
the next 12 statements in the normal, non-step mode before
returning to step mode. The 12 statements are not simply
skipped over, they are executed.

Execution of michael3 via the jumpout from galaxy results
in ALL keys except -STOP1- being inactive, yet on stopping
out the ms/sec ratio implies that there is a rather tight
loop being executed. Since there is nothing in the code
which could do this -- they are both y lessons -- I can
only assume that something is awry in the calculation of
the ms/sec, or that the loop is in a system routine invoked
by the jumpout-pause command combination.

Room 203b and the priorities and operation of the room

were designed by me to delineate more clearly the priorities
because too many people did not understand them, The dis-
tinction between professional authors and student authors
can be stated in more detail as follows:
1) Professional author is a programmer employed for a par-
   ticular course of project to develop Plato programs (can
   be undergraduates, graduate students, high school stu-
   dents or faculty).
2) Student programmers are those who have been given the
   privilege of working on the system and are working in-
   dependently of a specific project.
3) Student programmers writing programs for a credit UI
   course are "unscheduled students completing a class
   assignment [3]" unless they are occupying terminals
   reserved for their class.....E.R.Lyman (Tebby)

This may be old ground revisited but has a mailbox facility
similar to the one in use in the arpa network been
considered for PLATO? In the arpa network it is a system
level function that when a person logs onto a computer he
is told whether he has a message. A message is sent to
someone by a special command "sndmsg" which is available
on what would be analogous to the plato "choose a lesson"
or "author" page. Each known user has a name used by him
at login and this is how he is identified as the recipient
of a message. Copies may be sent also to other users who
are identified at the same time as the primary recipient.
This greatly expedites the sending and receiving of info
and could be implemented in conjunction with itc or some
other currently avilable program. The recipient also may
elect not to read the message in which case he will be
reminded again next time he signs in.

---------- response 1

Such a facility is available inside courses. A course
director can order a message placed on the screen of
any given student or author as he signs in, which that
student must skip past by pressing DATA on a page
between password and announcements.
Perhaps what is needed is a method for authors to
write such messages to authors in other courses, who
have their talk-flag activated. Comments, anyone?

each mark numbered consecutively from 1 to 18:

origin 1002

scalex 18
labelx 1

...but when the -scalex- parameter is changed to 19,
it produces an odd-looking axis with only every other
mark labeled. I know that this "quirk" is intended to
prevent crowding and produce asthetically appealing axes,
but how then does one get larger consecutively numbered
axes? (aside from labeling them by hand) Could the
"crowding limit" be raised, or better yet, how about
giving the author control of how the axes are labeled?

jumpout to numbered lessons, we then do a

I would like to have something like a 'consult' option
for students:

Under what conditions could a lesson send a message
to a station which is not in the same lesson?

Essentially one could leave a human 'tutor's station
information in router common, and if a routed student
issues a term 'tutor' (or 'talk', etc.) the tutor
would get paged (while he might be authoring or
whatever), based on the information in router common.
Next, student and tutor could get together
through talkomatic, etc.

Would 'same course' or 'ext flags on' sound like a
reasonable restriction for allowing some message be
sent to an arbitrary station?

Could such a message be sent then through the press
command (bad) or through some 'send' command?

---------- response 1

I agree. If the systems people come up with the "send"
command, I will have a nice communication lesson available
for the tutor to have a private conversation with each
student.

I would suggest using a beeper (an external device).
Store the station -$ you will be at in common.
If a student needs help you branch him to
a unit with a series of ext 0,yourstation'S in it.
As long as you have your ext options on you will hear
a series of beeps when the student executes the help
unit.
After you hear the beeps you head for the communications
lesson.The student could be jumped to the communications
lesson right after sending the ext's to you.
You could even customize you beeper so it would
light different indicators for different lessons.

        The 'trouble sheet' for lesson repair is not
adequate for leaving an explanation of what is wrong
with a terminal. Maybe I'm long winded, but it seems
I can never get the message in that I want to express.
        Would like to see lesson repair replaced with
another section of notes that works like notes so that
we can communicate better with hardware people.
        This hypothetical section of notes could and
should also be used to announce terminal delivery
schedules of schedule changes....delivery priorities.....
new terminal installations etc. so that those of us in
charge of budgets for PLATO usage can keep up with what
is going on for planning purposes. Without such a facility
it degenerates to every man for himself trying to contact
the right people on the phone to get the info.
        Perhaps some feel such info should be kept 'top

confusions or jealousies (sp?) or whatever. If that is the
case the notes could be locked so that only the originator
could read his note and any responses to it.
        The only fair alternative to remote users would
seem to be a toll free number thay could call at CERL
to get the hardware or billing info they need. But that
would certainly bug the administrative people and the
hardware people continuously. I think the expansion
of notes for hardware and billing type info. is a better
solution...........What do the other remote users think?

the three lines provided in repair seem, at least to me,
to be adequate.we are not interested in what lesson or
unit you were in during failure, or anything along that
line. what we would like is a simple statement such as:
"blows up when drawing lines" or " bad characters" or
"violent explosion, then nothing" or whatever.
if you think that it might be the keyset, swap with
another terminal, temporarily, and see if it works then.
if you do this, return the keysets to their orignal
terminals when done.
if more specific information is required, you will be
contacted by maintaince, that is why your phone number is
requested.

Friday my terminal failed while I was out of town.
I came in sat. and made about five calls to CERL to locate
someone to report the problem. They left the message with
the operator. Came in sun. and the terminal was still
blitzed. I made about five more calls....finally got
rader to whom I was able to explain the nature of the
problem...how it has occured before....and suggested that
he have a look at the modem for our terminal. He went in
and flipped the modem off and back on. The problem was
cured. Took about 3 min. to fix. Took 2 days to get to
someone to fix it. I assume the hardware people would like
to be notified that such problems have arisen and been
fixed. I also assume that would like to know something
more than "off again, on again, gone again, Flannigan."
        This is not the first time this problem has

How about this:
        An option g under notes which works as follows.
An author leaves a message for a specific individual.
Thereafter, when he goes into g only he can edit, read,
or read replies to his note. The only other person able to
read or reply is the one to whom it is addressed.
The note remains until both parties have consented to its
deletion bu pressing term wipeout after reading of replying,
or after 14 days.
After each time the note is edited or responded to again
by either party (including the first time). The other party
will be notified at signon that g note No.____ has been
updated when he hits term mail in author mode, or when he
signs on with his new 'mailbox' option on (accessed from
password page).
Term refer could pass it on to another who would be paged
in a similar manner at sign on.

I think that once the addressee has read the note it
should be destroyed..... as notes within a course are
currently treated.

If you need to type long notes on terminal problems,
how about just saying..."please see notes,part a for
further comments"...... then in notes(a) you can put
comments to your heart's content..... and without changing
the format of anything.

I believe we have (at least) 1 brand-new operator. Possibly
that explains part of your problem.

The type of notes I am suggesting is to enable dialogue
with responses back and forth as in this general interest
note. If the purpose were only to leave messages, what you
suggest would suffice. But it often takes an iterative/
approximation process to get the right info requiring
dialogue. Some feel (it seems) that such info should not
be advertised, yet phone calls are inefficient and expen-
sive.

I think I'll try it in the future.

      Is it feasible to add to the editor a multiple

      the present "copy a block" option)? With our
      lessons being "used" (in both senses of the
      word) at different locations, modification
      of a lesson, especially when of an extensive
      nature, requires copying the driver into a
      work lesson, making the corrections, and then
      replacing the old copy with the revised one.

      Even before the present pausing in the editor,
      the clearing of the work lesson took a bit of
      time (or at least a great deal of fast typing);
      now it is quite a major task ...

Sending a TV signal is very expensive in terms of
band-width.  The Plato IV system was specifically
designed to run on what signals could be crammed down
an ordinary telephone line in order to keep communications
cost down to a minimum.

For Plato V (maybe even Plato IV+) the engineers expect

idea would be to use a floppy disk or even maybe
better, a video tape machine, store signals and
call certain segments like the audio. Maybe even
short segments could be loaded from PLATO like a
charset. Once loaded, it could be repeatedly called
etc. Conceivably a "generator" lesson could be
used to rotate and move simple designs, transmit

     As a thought to the Data page. I feel that it might
be a reasonable feature to include a catagory (similiar to
say discipline) which would give prerequisites that the
author feels are necessary for anyone using the lesson.?
     Many authors write lessons, sparsely fill in the Data
page and then leave the university with few, if any,
people knowing much more than the lesson name. In the
time span between lesson creation, finish, and use many
many details can be forgotten. In an effort that past
work be utilized more efficiently, perhaps this can be
considered. ?

        The information you request does need to be provided
for every lesson, but I don't believe the data page is an
appropriate place. Data pages serve primarily to designate
ownership of lessons. The kind of information needed to
guess at the usefulness of a lesson belongs in a catalog
of lesson descriptions and, perhaps, in internal
documentation of the lesson. A few lines added to the data
page would not suffice even if authors took great care in
filling in data pages. As you have noted, they don't.

For the sake of clarity and efficiency we intend to

If it is important for your students to be able to use 
such names (with -store-, ansv-, -ansu-, -compute-), you
will still be able to do this:

define student,jcount=jcount

Writing in size¬=0 is completely different from writing
in size=0. In order to make the half-space available
in size¬=0 a modification wile have to be made to a
whole complete systems sub-routine. (I'm sure that it
will be made...someday.) My point is that at the moment
other things are considered more important than a half-
space in size¬=0: such as more lesson space, better
spelling judging, improved key-echoing, .....

Do you mean "access" instead of "font"? A simple locked
super or sub works in size¬=0, butˆ access locked super (to
go up a whole line) does not. There locked supers in a
row will move one up 15/16 of a line. Won't that work
for most cases?

thanks for the explanation...?
yes, i guess i mean access instead of font (although
it did seem to me that anything that was either accessed
or fonted was not happening in size¬=0).
my list of things that presently do not work in size¬=0
includes:
  1) special characters
  2) access lock sup and sup
       (i.e. shift-square,shift-(sup$or$sub)
  3) half-space
this is probably not complete, but i think that
these are reasonable modifications of the present
sized writing repertoire. (at least the last two would
be nice)

Points 2 and 3 will presumably be implemented eventually,
but sizing of charset characters is not possible due to
hardware limitations. It is conceivable that there might
eventually be a "line-mode" charset which could be sized.

There is an obvious need for sized characters: for
those lessons that use a different charset. Having
the ability to "size" the charset, would give us the
ability to use "sized writing"

condensor even if it is between a shop and a start
command.The note was never answered and has now disappeared.
Will someone please tell me a)what the condensor does
with the use command that is stopped out b) what other
commands are found by the condensor between a start
and stop command c) why (and whatever otehr commands
are seen) is executed this way d) why none of this

      It was answered to the effect that a -use- command
has the effect of inserting the block in question at that
place, so the condenser has to look through that block
to see if there is a -start- command there.

   The note refering to 45 second condensing times has
me worried. Authors coding lessons that may jump between
several lesson need some indication of how long condense
waits may eventually be. Naturally jumpouts should be
minimized. Currently 1 jumpout every five or ten minutes
appears to be acceptable. Very long condense times could
change this situation drastically. Are there any
tenative plans here?

---------- response 1

        Nobody can answer your question about eventual wait
times yet, but we do know that we will have to put limits
on. We get 20 condense requests per minute and it takes
1.6 seconds for an average condense! Authors will have to
condense shorter test lessons and less often. Students
jumpouts will have to be kept to some reasonable limit.
We just don't know the numbers yet.

No AIDS! First and foremost-- such copies would be stolen
and distributed and reproduced by totally uncontrolled
groups. (We have already seen "TUTOR manuals" by, say,
CAI research group of Podunk U.) The systems programmers
DO NOT WANT detailed printed material distributed until
the system settles down much more. The new INTRO stuff will
deal with -unit-, -draw-, -write-, -goto- etc. Those
commands are quite stable. But who knows what will happen
to -itoa-?

2) A print of "aids" would be unweildy and difficult to
read. (No one denies that reference material is nice.)

3) "aids" was never intended for the beginner and is
almost worse than nothing. The new INTRO should help.

A word of explanation: Back in the infancy of PLATO IV
charsets were not stored in individual's lessons, but in
central charset lessons--one went and asked Bill Golden for
a "charset space".

Lesson "charsets" is a remnant of this old system. It
contains a bunch of general charsets felt ot be more-or-less
useful to plato users. Anyone is welcome to make use
of these charsets. In order to load a charset form

playh track,sector,length $$ invokes a time-locked pause
* of .36length seconds

play track,sector,lenght,endclck $$ like -play- above
* but assigns 'endclck' the reading that 'clock' will have
* when the message is complete (.36length sec.). this
* allows audio to be concurrent with screen animation yet
* lets program check for message completion

holdc endclck $$ a timelocked pause until 'clock'

This question is prompted by the somewhat

maybe:

(a) document the options that compete for the save storage.
(IBM would word the E option like 'the remainder
of the block is saved and ...')

(b) show the amount of material saved (if any) in the
title line of the line display; room could be made
there by omitting LESSON BLOCK or abbreviating them.

(c) finally, use a shifted key, different from HELP
to activate all options that clobber the save buffer.
DATA1 would seem appropriate.

My apologies to Rick Blomme for the computerese in (a),
but computerese sounds better than no warning at all.

As for (c), maybe some poll of the using community
could be taken.

In the absence of any -inhibit erase- or -erase- statements
the panel is erased when you enter a new main unit. (A main
unit is a unit reached by a keypress or a -jump- command.)

If in unit a you have an -inhibit erase-, and then reach
unit b by pressing NEXT, then reach unit c by pressing
NEXT, unit a's display should be visible in a and b, but
erased when you reach c.

The situation cupec describes surprises me; I would

This problem has nothing to do with changes made this week.

This problem is that when a lesson goes into an "autobreak"
condition, keys other than -stop- or -stop1- will be ignored
(except that the last key pressed is saved).

Some thought is being given to a way of saving the first 4
keys before ignoring input.

---------- note 252 input keys
  03/13     09.44     eland       csa

In the not too distant past, it was possible to collect keys
of input before the screen had completed its display.
Lately, this has not been true. At first I concluded that
the system was just particularly busy, and the above mode
of operation would soon return. However, some of the recent
notes seem ot indicate that there is something more
fundamental behind the problem.?
If the system is indeed about to change its mode of
operation, could we be allowed the following option:?
Whereas in the past a "catchup" command could cause input
to be ignored until the screen display was complete, can
we have a "dontcatchup" command which _will_ allow keys to
be collected before the screen display is complete (and that
means also to collect keys during autobreak)?????
Without such an option, quick scanning throught "pages" of
material is extremely tedious.

As usual, we guys here in the boonies have another
" addition,. The last idea really came over great.
Better than I ever expected. (re. the message when
and what the system is doing). Would it be possible
to have some way of notifying us that say a lesson
has been listed or any other service as a matter of
fact has been taken care of. It is hard to tell in
most cases until the listing comes. Which is like
four days (average) to Iowa! That means before we
can essentially change a lesson. (and want a back up
listing) We must wait four days.
        One method might be to have a note hare in
notes or special note system in "request". Or better
why not write a message to the person that requested
the listing (you keep the records of sigh-on etc?)

The mailbow I mentioned in an earlier note might be a good
place that a program could easily find to leave a message
since it has access to the user/site information when the
printout is requested. A simple standard message with

If I have a lesson I don't want anyone to see, I put an

it, I don't care whether they see on a plato screen or on

Besides, with no change code, I can copy the lesson into
my workspace and thus " steal" something more valuable
than a hard copy of the lesson: a compileable, running
copy. If you don't have a vacant lesson space handy (ha!)
it can be messy to copy whatever bits and pieces you can
get into an almost full lesson.

It has always done the same for authors and students, and
it was recently changed to get the job done right. Pre-
viously, the system would press a -back- key if no key
had been pressed during the last ten minutes. Now, it
presses shift-stop along with back. We thought that 10
minutes with no key pressed meant no person anymore??

...Remember, as Bruce noted, that all old terminals will
automatically do a full screen erase (this is built in to
the hardware and not a programmed feature) if no change
has been made to the display for about 5 minutes. Hence,
a system "backout" after 10 minutes of inactivity is long
after the screen has gone blank anyway. We now at last
do have new terminals with the auto-erase time increased
to a more reasonable time approaching 30 minutes--and we
should probably now consider moving our programmed " backout"
time up also--does 15 or 20 minutes of inaction at a
terminal seem enough? (that means no key presses or
changes to the display for that period of time).

---------- response 8
  03/14     12.24     emg       mtcc

Would it be nightmarishly impossible to suspend programs
from ecs to disk after say 5 minutes thus conserving ecs
and still leaving the terminal so that a person" thinking"
or calculating or reading other material or talking to an
instructor of whatever could not lose his program status
but not waste tight resources at the same time? Maybe
a screen erase (panel saver) would be ok after 5 if, when
the original person (or whomever) came back he would get
a message such as "terminal in use, type STOP1 to use
or DATA and your password to continue". This would allow
people to go away and return if noone else needed the
terminal but would help prevent other people from fouling
up the students status or records if not necessary.
Are not most of the essential mechanisms necessary to do
this already in the system anyway?

Would it be possible to call a special meeitng between

of selecting a file naming convention that will provide
the flexibility and long range expandibility needed for
disk system implementation........ and at the same time
provide authors with some concerete way of doing variable
jumpouts, joinouts, and such without having to worry
about drastic incompatibilities in the future? It seems
silly to remove features from the system every time
someone decides they might create a problem in the future.
It makes more sense to face the problem head-on now
and develop a naming convention now rather than waiting
for the optimal solution to just walk up an present itself
a couple years from now. A little planning goes a long way.

        The whole point of removing variable jumpouts was
to ensure system compatability in the future. Thus, when
a descision is finally made on the best type of lesson
cataloging scheme, we will be able to run a system - wide
conversion of all present lessons (if nescessary).
        This is an experimental system, and we do make
mistakes. The allowing of variable jumpouts in the first

I agree with the need for a meeting. If the only thing

systems and users, that would be sufficient reason. The
aura of pontificating (deserved or not), and the accusatory
tone of users' notes (actual or imagined), has only ser-
ved to point out a long-standing chasm between groups
within PLATO. Maybe a general meeting can do nothing to
alleviate this condition, but I hope others feel that one
more try is in order. The (almost) meeting before Xmas
was a good try,but the weather and logistics of the
season ensured that it did not come off. How about an-
other attempt? Say, 7 pm some day next week?

Yes, a meeting is definitely needed. Even if the actual
details of any new naming system are invisible to the user,
it still helps a great deal to know what is actually going
on when you are writing a lesson. Secondly, the variable
jumpout is a powerful tool for creating individualized
lesson sequences, and it is essential that the possible
benefits of removing variable jumpouts are weighed against
the disadvantages. From the author's point of view, it
still looks like we are deleting a major feature of the
tutor language just in case we might possibly someday make
a hypothetical change in the structure of lesson names.
It would cool a lot of the anger out here if some specific
plans were presented.
Besides, some of us stupid, whining, ignorant authors might
have some good ideas!

---------- note 6 from??
  02/26     11.53     eland       csa

This note is a vote in favor of keeping the "from" command
(or the provision of a fitting substitute): I understand
the problem of using "from" to "feed" a jumpout command. But
there are situations where one simply wants to know where
someone came from. Such information would enable branching
decisions to be made, or it might just be saved for some
type of documentation [eg. all comments about computer
science lessons are kept in one place -- we have to know
the name of the lesson from which each comment was made].
It is not practical in such situations to use the "match"
form of the "from" -- too many lessons would have to be
listed, and the list would constantly be changing.?
What hopes do we have of still getting the "from" info???

As for "finding" lessons..... at this point in time we
are glad for stray lessons, but basically the policy is
still that what an author does with his/her lesson (short
crashing the system, subversion or smut?) is none of

  02/26     15.33     cnb       mtcc

     There is a system problem using a particular lesson
name in some commands. The lesson "errors" must use a
variable reference in the -charset- command. See the
first block of the lesson.

     Bruce Sherwood knows that the problem has existed for
a long time, but with the changes in the -jumpout-
command I think this bug should be cleared up.

---------- response 1

For the moment you can take care of that by writing
  charset ('erros'),charblok
but eventually you will be able to write
  charset errors, charblok
because no attempt will be made to see whether that
word "errors" is a variable name.

In about ten days a CERL Report, X-41, will be published on
the subject of PLATO curriculum materials, most of which
have been tested out in the 'classroom' (referred to as
'subject-tested'). The report will be of special interest
to teachers considering using PLATO programs.

The report is not a catalogue of PLATO lessons, name by
name, but of topics about which lessons have been written.

Copies of the report will be available in the CERL library
for any persons who may wish them; and copies will be
mailed to the PLATO remote sites. It is the intention to
update and revise the report periodically so as to add newly
tested materials and correct omissions or errors.

I may be the only one on the system who has the following
problem: At times the automatic system note 'plato will
go down in 3 minutes' which is inserted on the student
page causes one plotting routine of mine to go crazy!
The reason is that I am plotting the location of one
point which is connected to the previous, and so on.
The inserted note sets an 'at' point on the screen which
of course causes all lines to be drawn to the note.
The problem itself is that we are filming each of these
drawings to create an animated sequence (the extra 'random'
lines really don't add much). My question is: could an
option be created (or a command) that would prevent such
a system note (or any outside monitor, etc.) from being
displayed?

---------- response 1
  02/27     12.20     b sherwood       s

Read the writeup carefully, The "keys=" option of the
-pause- command allows you to specify all keys that will
not be discarded by the -pause-. Any (listed) key
not discarded by the -pause- will be looked at to decide
what to do with it. In particular, if it is the DATA key
and you have a preceding -data- command, the branch to
the data unit is taken. If you want the DATA key only to
take you past the -pause-, place the -data- command
after the -pause-.

I grant you that this is not necessarily the way you
might guess it would work, but careful consideration of
cases seems to show that this is indeed the appropriate
way to have it implemented. Of course the NEXT key is
a little special in this respect, in that the unit
specified by the -next- command will be branched to only
upon completion of the present unit, not upon pressing
the NEXT key at a -pause-.

---------- response 2
  02/27     12.22     b sherwood       s

Note too that the handling of the TERM key is a little
special in this respect. Unless you say keys=term, the
TERM key will be discarded and not take you past the
-pause-, but if you do say keys=term the TERM key will
ask "what term". The only way to have the TERM key take
you past a -pause- is to use a blank -pause- statement.

---------- response 3

Thanks for your quick response, Bruce.?
My problem was not that DATA took me to unit choice, but
that NEXT did NOT take me to unit choice. To me there is an
inconsistency here: the system "obeyed" my "data key"
branch, but ignored the "nex key" branch which I had
specified. It seems to me that a "next" command ought to
be in effect as soon as it is executed, rather than waiting
till the end of the unit before it is considered.?
What do you think?

----------  response 4
  02/28     08.38     parrellow       uimatha

The NEXT key is very special, since it is used so often
at arrows, etc. to move a person along. The beauty of the
pause keys=funct is that it allows all the function keys
to be operative, but still gives you a way of pausing in
the middle of a page (giving the student time to think about
what has been written) and then continuing without erasing
the screen (by pressing NEXT).

---------- response 5
 02/28     10.38     rader       s

It is intended that the new pause permit you to take
!help"-type branches, and special branches--just as
though you were at an arrow. The -next- key must be
reserved for normal advancing through the unit.

When the system does a backout on everyone---

Am I right that if you are in author mode, it presses
-BACK- only 5 times? If so there is a minor bug.
On a block page (ie block a), insert mode, then press

to the "Press NEXT to Begin" page.

---------- response 1

A backout does not simply press the -back- key several times

What actually occurs is a combination of -back- and -stop1-
keys which is repeated every few seconds until a terminal is
removed from the system.

backout fails, please let us know.

---------- note 50 jump var
  02/27     13.52     friedman       csa

I just realized something else that the old jumpout
allowed us, that does not seem to available with the new:
the ability to jump to a unit whose name is stored in a
variable; in particular, a unit in the same lesson. This
is sort of an odd case of the old jumpout, and has only
occasional use; but...?
I use it extensively in the following situation: A help-
type key is to enter a "help" sequence which is actually
a separate lesson. So. the help-unit saves the current
value of baseu and jumpouts to the "help" lesson. On return
from the "help" lesson, the main lesson does a jumpout to
itself at the unit whose name was saved (the former value of
baseu).?
Is there some other way to do this? The help-type key can
be a term, so the the unit requesting help is completely
unpredictable.?
(More in ist response)

---------- response 1
  02/27     13.59     friedman       csa

I'm not sure a "jumpout return,return" is the answer,
because on return, the unit after the jumpout is now the
base unit (isn't it?), so we still have the problem of
getting back to what WAS the base unit before the jumpout.?
What is needed is the ability to jump to a unit whose
identification (not absolutely necessary that it be the
alphabetic name) is stored in a variable. (This identifi-
cation, if not alphabetic, would be the value of baseu or
a similar system variable; but it would have to be constant
even if a re-condense has taken place.) I know this sounds
messy--what other choice do we have?

Thanks, Parello, but that won't do it. The point is that
back1 won't do anything useful, since on return from the
"help" lesson, we are in a base sequence (like it or not)
because the lesson has just "begun" (as far as plato knows).

Dave, your suggestion should take care of this case
admirably. I would probably code something like
jumpout lesson,¬0n1¬1
where "lesson" is my lesson name, and n1 contains the
desired unit name (saved from baseu). Thanks.

   You are quite wrong if you think embedding saves

        The PLATO staff are fully aware of the educational,
recreational, and other values of games. We have never
considered taking game lessons off PLATO.
        Having said that, I wish to add that we cannot
condone game playing in rooms 2038 or 257 which annoys
students or authors! We admit that we have been unable to
enforce our rules, but we don't have to like the infractions
        Also, we cannot condone stealing lesson spaces from
other users in order to write new games. (this is the usual
reason for changing codewords) And in a time of very scarce
disk space, we cannot accept your diverting space obtained
ostensibly for some high priority use to more games.
        With those exceptions, I second Judy Sherwood's
statement that short of plagiarism, obscenity, and lible,
what an author does with his lesson space is only his
business!

          1. We did not steal any lesson space.

          2. We were not playing a game, we were writing
          a game.....not the same thing.

          3. The lesson spaces in which the games were
          stored were also being used for "higher purposes";
          the space was merely for temporary storage.

          4. The fact remains that the systems person in-
          volved acted in a manner which, we feel, does not
          reflect the current policy of CERL, and we feel
          that such actions (harassment, thereats, etc.)

Todd... Did you consult with your faculty supervisor before
starting to write all these notes?

It was my understanding that the lesson in question was
released to you for the writing of _physics_ _lesson_ material
and not for the purpose of writing games. Unless I
understood wrong at the time (and I admit I was only an
onlooker), that was NOT YOUR LESSON, but merely a "loaner".

Specific permission to change the security code (and thus
to edit) was given by the "owner" of the lesson.

Please don't get the impression that Todd is the only

are just a little tired of seeing changed edit codes and
strange notes in our lessons....and, to me, verbal abuse
by a systems person strikes the upper limit of my
patience. Of course, I can see that the student is
the most important aspect of PLATO; otherwise none of
us would be here. But how can one successfully cope
with the day-to-day changes on the system and at the
same time be constantly harassed by a somewhat vehement
game-hater?
        Don't get me wrong.....I understand the problems
currently facing the system, and I can see how some of
you must feel.....but I think it is important not to
forget how some of us feel who are in the middle of
this new experience!

It would be helpful if persons leaving notes about the
actions of some specific member of the staff would name
the "subject in question". Refering to the system staff

To the list of -jumpout-, -from-, -lessin-, and 'router',
should we add -course-? Since it is a command whose
contents are assigned to a variable for various sorts of

file naming schemes.

Perhaps course names are somewhat different from lesson
names, in that they may last only for a few months, etc.
Presumably operational lessons would not have -course-
commands in them, since such lessons would not fit
in with use at many different institutions and under many
different routers.

  Bruce, the CC English group is in the process of writing
a router for the Language Arts Curriculum, which is to be
field-tested in September at several different institutions
in September. Each institution will have its own curric-
ulum, thanks to John Risken's Curriculum Management System.
However, each institution, and possibly each instructor,
will have their own course. AT any rate, ALL courses
will be attached to the same router lesson; was this
multiple attachment capability not intended to be used
after it was created?
  So far, the only concrete reason that systems has given
to justify the (proposed) restrictions on the jumpout com-
mand concern the fact that an automatic conversion cannot
be done on alogrithmically constructed lesson names. The
conventions to be used for naming lessons in the future
are irrelevant. (cont)

---------- response 3

  Instead of restricting the jumpout command, and all other
commands and system variables that have to be rewritten
simply for an automatic conversion to take place, why can-
not we, the curriculum builders -- who are the ones integ-
rally affected by such restrictions -- bear the onus of
changing the contents of our common lists by hand to conform
to the new conventions when they are created? At least let
us do this in router lessons; as John has already said,
let us pick our own poison.
  Sometimes I am not sure that the systems staff realizes
the impact that certain changes which they make have upon
well-developed. sophisticated programs. How would they
be affected if their -readcm- command was changed so as
to make variables illegal in the tag field?

Given the extra use of room 203b in the near future--as per
note ¬$90, could we get an upgrading of the enforcement of
the no games policy in 203b? An immediate suggestion for
improvement would be the removal from the room of anyone
playing a game. I am more than a little frustarated about
reports of game-players being told to desist, switching to
author mode (in one case at least to writing a game), then
switching back to the game after the operator, whom the
student has had to summon, has gone back upstairs.?
Of course, this would be unnecessary if each game lesson
was required to have a site test in its ieu. When I
suggested this earlier, the only responses(s) I got were:?
1. It would take too much space--The small number of word
involved would seem to be a necessary price.?

    Rick, I think we're all with you on the "no noise"
part, but does "student priority" mean authors have
second priority? This may cause problems, particularly
for authors under grants and contracts. If student
priority is necessary, perhaps it could only be in effect
8am to 10pm. While the details may be tricky to work out,
the spirit of the recommendation is quite commendable.
The simplistic value judgments that are sometimes applied
to "game" and other lessons of a non-standard teaching
nature are the basis of many previous proposals, which
have been less than optimum.

At 3:50 in the morning, in fact since 12:00 the previous
notes/replies make little sense...; In room 203b, where
I am right now, there are at least 70: of the terminals
open... I don't think that a mandate is necessary to
regulate the usage of this room, or of any one site in
particular is necessary. From the hour of 10 pm on, one
has little trouble finding a terminal in most cases...
What is needed is a re-allocation of the working hours
that some people use: I have always worked at this hour
(or at least from 10 on) because:
a) I can get more work done with less hassle
b) I don't get deleted because of ecs shortages
c) I have homework to do first
True, my sleeping hours are a bit strange, but I can get
more accomplished a better percent of the time...

let's look at it this way:
1) the students MUST have access when scheduled .
2) When there is a class, or a group of students operating,
it becomes ridiculous to test lessons (especially when there
are several different curricula and their associated
on)
3) There is all this open time in the dead hours of the
night when there are no students that need priority.
(they leave soon after the first experimental plato arrives,
or when the janitor cleans at 11:00)
So, lets not dream for ecs during prime time, USE it
on the graveyard shift!!!

Again, and before the multitudes come crashing down with

At this hour of the morning, the problem is obviously NOT
ECS nor is it likely to be open terminals. There is still,
however, too high a probability that a student who attempts
to study at this time will be unable to concentrate as well
as he would like because of the noise generated primarily by
game-players (shouts of triumph, dismay, etc.). I do not
accuse all game-players of this, nor do I claim this always
occurs, but I have seen it too often to ignore it. This is
the reason I favor Rick's "no noise" regulation. (I
am interpreting the priority given to students a being
priority for unscheduled students over game-players.)?
I believe there is less use (at least by students) during
the early am hours due to the 10pm 2am test period. (Not a
complaint about testing, just an opinion about explanation
of decline in student use at this time.)

OK, I made a reply to the note concerning lack of ability

totally that there should be some kind of noise pollution
restriction in 203b... but I think that the reply given by
Mr. Mckeown misses the point I made: that there is a lot
of open time from 10 on when you _can_ author without fear
of insanity/deletion,and that this time could be made use
of by the voluntary restriction of authoring at peak student
load times... This is not to mean that there should be a
plato classroom patrol that throws authors/students/game
players out based on a rigid set of hours... It is up to

        Yes. Thats the way it should be. We (Rick Blomme and
I) fell that trying to start a search outside of the field
specified (i.e., an offset value of either 0, or greater
than the length) is a mistake on the author's part, thus
an execution error should result.

        The routine does allow an immediate abort with -1
(not found) returned with either a zero search length or
a zero object length.

Students get to unit embdorm of lesson morphogen. This
unit becomes their main unit. From their they goto unit

who already has it loaded. Could we have a command such as

charflag lesson, charset $$ "charflg" = charset flag

...which sets -error- to -1 because it is not loaded, and
to 0 if it is.

earlier suggestions that reserve words be created which tell
us what charset is loaded have not ben acted on. i assume
reasons exist for this and i'm hoping the -charflg- idea
might get done becuase it can borrow existing code from the
-charset- command.

I am puzzled. I thought that once-upon-a-time a  full-screen
erase  (erase- command with blank tag, or a -jump-) cut
off any screen output generated just before the erase.
In that case the sequence (in the initial entry unit)

  at      1215
  write   Now loading characters....
  charset zonk,zip
  erase

would prevent the message from flashing on the screen if
the charset had already been loaded. That certainly does
not happen now, which makes me wonder whether we have made
some unintentiolal change in the handling of the full-
screen erase.......?

----------response 2
  03/03     16.56     bob y       r1

that's exactly the problem, bruce. there have been at least
two changes over the past 3-4 months which have affected
the way in which output is aborted when a full screen
erase is coming.

each time iVe caught the 'charset is loading' message
slipping past, i've found a new way to program around it.
but it keeps coming back to haunt me, and, what's worse,
to confuse the kindergarten kids we're running.

i'd like to see something done in this area which will
be reliable. using the 'aborted output' method seems to
me to be a somewhat sophisticated method of dealing with
a rather trivial problem.

---------- note 152 systems
  03/02     10.15     john r       r1

TUTOR has made another great leap! People who
used a timed, keylocked pause and checked for key=timeup
after the pause will now have to add an additional check
to make sure that the duration of the pause was not = 0.
To have to do this seems logically inconsistent since
'timeup' ought always to be the signal that timing is
complete.

Is there any rationale, systems people, for this change?
If there is no rationale, will it be fixed. (note, by the
wat that I have no programs affected by this at this moment;
my concern is that TUTOR seems to be somewhat less
straightforward because of it. since much time has been
spent in the past making things more consistent (character
strings come to mind), it seems strange to see activity
that moves in the opposite direction)

---------- response 1
  03/03     03.35     blomme       s

   The performance of the command can be adjusted various
ways; it does not seem specially obvious (to me) that
if one is processing a key and it "goes through" a pause 0
that the key should mystically disappear and be replaced
by a timeup key on the other side of the pause. If that
is indeed the only mode that is useful and makes sense
to people, we will change it--I think that either way
will need some careful documentation in aids.

---------- response 2
  03/03     11.00     b sherwood       s

My impression is that "pause 0" was wanted by people who
were setting a flag to -1, 0 or some positive number in
order to run a program in a step, continuous, or slowed
mode. Note also that key cannot be set to "timeup" in
the case of "pause -1", since after a blank pause you get
the key the student typed (assuming there was no -time-
command). So setting key to "timeup" after "pause 0" would
not be consistent to setting key to the student key after
"pause -1".

---------- response 3
  03/03     14.01     john r       r1

But with a negative or a positive tag the effect of
-pause- is to alter 'key'. Thus -pause 0- _is_ anomalous.

---------- response 4
  03/03     21.11     blomme       s

   WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT???!!!
After timing has occurred you are no longer processing
the originally key pressed by the student--the "key" that
causes processing next is a system created one due to the
timing being completed and the mnemonic "timeup" was
selected for this key. I thought everyone realized that
a "pause 1" was both a signal for completion of processing
of the current key as well as a request for a 1 second
delay before resumption of processing. Because the option
of doing this sort of operation via a "time 1" and "pause"
is available, it is essential that the system created "key"
signaling completion of timing be identifiable by the
author to distinguish it from a student generated one.
As I indicated before, any and all situations (whether
felt to be "strange" or not) related to timing should be
documented in aids.

It would appear that anybody with a "pause v1" in his
program expects the value of "key" to be the system
defined value of "timeup" afterwards--and, as John says, not
have to worry about special checks for v1=0.

Seriously, we have a define strong prejudice against
adding additional commands to be embedded in the -write-
statement. The syntax gets very complicated and the
statements get hard to read. This affects the efficiency
of the condensing process, too. Most of us continue to
be very puzzled by the popularity of some embedding
features. For example, most system programmers wouldn't
dream of embedding in initial -at-, since it reduces
readability, flexibility, and editability, yet we notice
that "write ¬0at,1215¬1 See the dog!" is a very popular
form. Why is it so popular?

For one thing, Bruce, disk space!--embeds use less disk
space in the source code. Of course, they also use _more_
disk space after being condensed, i.e., in ECS, but....

Perhaps aids should emphasize that embeds cost in ECS
space; also, aids could mention real reason for having
embeds, which is, I understand (correct me if I'm wrong),
for ease in creating wrong-answer messages in one write
so that they will erase after a no-judgement.

I had what I thought was a very good reason for suggesting
the embeded pause, Correct me if you disagree.

 When writing a large paragraph, it is frequently desired
to present it a sentence or concept at a time. (P) Humans
like plato can only process a certain amout of information
in any given time frame. And humans like plato get 'grumpy'
when asked to process more than that limit. (P) When authors
try to fix that using a series of at, write, pauses, it
gets messy. (P) I just went through a lesson and changed a
couple of paragraphs to implement this, and although
it now works, its hard to read and nearly impossible to
edit.

---------- response 10
  03/04     12.11     deiss       pharmacy

Let me put it another way:
     When a good speaker presents information to an audience
he makes effective use of all the cues he has at his
disposal to direct the listeners attention to various
portions of his message. He gets the emphosis on the
right sylabble (by changes of pitch,mood,volume, etc.).
With plato we have similar control over the visual
dimensions of the stimulus (location,size,rotation,etc.).
I think an embeded pause would give us a more easily
used and more directly understood analogue to those
things the speaker uses that are time dependent (changes
in meter, rhythm, etc.).

As part of an answer to Bruce's question about embedding
at, I find it very useful for conditional statements, when
different messages go at different locations. This can
be done without embedding but seems much more elegant in
one writec command.

Also, what was the outcome of the discussion on replacing
the R on the index page with the number of replies? Such
a thing would be real handy on notes like this one.

Jim--The people responsible for notes haven't done anything
about better feedback (better than "R"), that's what.

As to the embedded pause: I can see that within your own
framework it looks nice; however, it doesn't appear to have
wide use--and would add even more clutter to current ideas
of what TUTOR is. It would seem that most people in fact
manage this timing now. Think about it--first a pause--
then you want to be able to do something with the key that
comes in (like branch)--which means you wanted to do some
calculations--which means you wanted to embed whole units
worth of stuff in the write statement, and branch (out of
the write statement, sometimes, of course) accordingly.

I don't know about you, but it sounds like a bad dream to
me--and we have no intention of opening this version of
Pandorra's box!

The obsession authors have with embeds has come about
for the love of mike! What is going on here?
I can't believe that, the arrow went up a line! Well,
it seems to be back to normal, maybe it was a transmission
error? Anyway, where was I....
The obsession authors have with embeds is due to the fact
that 1)embeds take up less room in a block, 2) embeds
are easier than remembering to put an -at- or whatever on
the previous line.
So, embeds do have a purpose...

SD and SS are not going to execute embedded or other
kinds of -show-s, since they depend on the value of
variables during execution. The question relates to
embedded -at-s, and those aren't going to be done, either.

Nobody EVER intended to question the use of embedded
-show- commands. The "embed" feature was _built_ for -show-!

The other embed features were added (-at- and -mode-) were
added at the request of authors.

       I agree that there are places where embedded -at-
and/or -mode- make programming much easier. However, as
one whose purpose in life is helping other people find
programming mistakes, I DON'T LIKE THEM. It is soooo
much easier to find that nasty -mode erase- if the -mode-
is explicitly stated in the command field.....!

On the "type the name of your course" page, may I suggest
that this read something like "type your course". Our
students are confused by the "type your name" and
"type the name..." which appear on different frames.
Thus when they see the "name not in course" message

Paul:
     Instead of creating a new jump etc. (jump*) why not
use jump ¬oexpression¬1 as is similar to computed gotos
in many other languages. Then the command used would be the
same but the ¬0¬1 syntax would flag the condensor to do its
special stuff. P.S. - would this command necessitate
saving a unit jump table in the tutor execution code?

---------- response 8
  03/06     16.07     emg       mtcc

Paul: The way this is being handled in the CAMIL language
is by the use of PROCEDURE type variables which can take
on effec??ively the names of procedures as their value.
Since you do not have typed variables as such why not
just make a calc command form such as
calc n1?xxxxxx
where xxxxxx is a unit name, and then a command
such as jump n1 could be condensed such
that n1 would be interpreted as containing the compiled
form(or a reference through a table of unit names
encountered as xxxxxx type tags so you would only have to
store names of units which might be referenced in this way)
of a unit name. The xxxxxx form could use some type of
quotes so that it would not be interpreted as a normal
alpha character string.
In this way any of the existing mechanisms which are
appropriate might be used to compute "unit name values"
which could then be used in jumps.

But I am afraid the example course name will cause more
confusion than clarity. In Vet. Med. we have only one
PLATO course for all of our students, but several of the
academic courses use PLATO material. Students will not be
certain about what to use as a course name. I would guess

While in inspect-only mode, enter micro block and press

does not invite you to change it. Now press NEXT and the

You are correct; the first appears to be an error, and we

Don't be too sure of getting the first thing fixed.
Segments are stored as integers(what form would one choose
for a 12 bit floating point number?) and flagging this as
a condense error is probably better than automatically
rounding to an integer.

I accept your apology (possibly on behalf of someone else),

I would think that a system such as this would automatically

For information purposes: I had to request a reload of the
older version (see note ¬$225). This is reasonable, but the
version which had to be loaded will not accept *specs*
bumpshift. This, of course, causes the *specs* command to
be ignored and caused execution errors in many lessons and
incorrect results in others. It happened, of course, on the
night before an exam. (I have spent the last 1.5 hours
deleting specs noshift.)

The message will be displayed on his records page.
Type his number on the main page, as though you were
going in to edit that student's records, and you will see
his message, if he has one. Type "5off" on that page
to delete the message.

I'd like to add my vote for some kind of alphabetization
scheme, and also some way of dividing course records into
'class sections' for those of us how must run several
distinct student groups in one course. This could be
solved by allowing the author to enter markers in the
list of students associated with a course, eg. section1
section2, etc., to access student records beginning at
certain markers, and to alphabetize starting from certain
markers. It would also be nice if student records could
be accessed by student name instead of student number.
Frequently one has to fish through a long list of
students to find the one he wants to edit. What say yee?

It used to be that if you defined "kg", "kgs", and "s"
and the student wrote "kg s" this response was incorrectly
taken to mean "kgs" rather than "kg?s". This is now fixed.

therefor important that these dial up ports not be locked

When a port is locked up by an inactive terminal there is
one fewer port for the remaining users to compete and as
a result some users are unable to operate. Please stop
this practice as if it is continued, some sort of system
timeout or auto hang-up will have to be implemented. If
there is a particular reason for reserving a dial-up port

In putting terminals in individual classrooms, we have
found it important that the teacher be able to specify
the order of student access and the on-times for terminals.
The most convenient way to do this is to have each terminal
revert to a passive monitor state when a student is through,
leaving the name of the next person on the screen, or
leaving a you-can't-use-me-now message until the next
ON period begins. We have programs that do this (as long
as nobody shift-stops), but they necessitate leaving
the last user's records attached to the terminal; if the
system crashes, that student's current status is lost - even
though he was really done 30 minutes earlier. Do any of you
systems people have any ideas for ways to preserve the
monitor state and yet project the records of the user?

Would check-pointing solve the crash problem, John? Still,
what you are ultimately asking for is a system level
lesson which would allow site directors to allocate their
terminal usage on-line, some sort of scheduler particular
to a site which could be changed by the site director and
which would be checked prior to allowing entry at that
site. Personally, I feel that this should have high

Checkpointing would be using a sledge hammer to drive home

courses running simultaneously. Maybe a -chkpnt- command
that could be executed only once per session - and that

While you're about it, could you make it a bit easier

message while copying-a-block from one lesson with

Currently one must enter the change code of the origin
lesson in the change code of the destination lesson,
then BACK OUT of the destination lesson, change one's
own security code to match, go back in, and do the copy.
Then change the change code back, back out again, change
one's own code again, and return. How about, either...

        a) An option to type in a security code on
           the copy-block page, or...

Just to keep the record straight:?
If a lesson has a zero inspect code, you can copy-a-block
from it to another lesson without knowing the change code.
But if the lesson has a (non-zero) inspect code, you
cannot. I agree that this does seem inconsistent.
(Sorry, my previous note about this was based on an
incomplete test.)?
Why NOT allow copy-a-block if the lesson being copied
into has the same change OR inspect code as either the
change OR inspect code of the lesson being copied from,
or if the lesson being copied from has a zero change
OR inspect code?

  03/09     13.50     frankel       p

Sorry, I misunderstood the discussion about inspect codes
matching...here's the way it works (now, at least):
The computer stores your security code in memory (and in
your records). When you enter a lesson, it sees if that
security code matches either the inspect or change code
of the lesson you want to get into, and, depending on
what it finds, does (hopefully) the right thing.
When you copy a block, the computer once again checks
the codewords of the copy-from lesson against the code-
word it has stored. If either match, you can proceed with
the copy. If they don't match, you can (now) type in
the security code of the copy-from lesson. So, there
is _no_ use of the codewords on the copy-into lesson.
Of course, a zero-code always matches the stored codeword.

I'm glad you like the option. I'd hate to have to take it
out due to disinterest. The problem with doing what you
want is that by the time I read your *list title
command, I've already printed out the header. I'd have
to make a special pass through the lesson to find out
if the list requestor wants a title on the first page,
block a "partsed out", or a block directory before the
lesson. I doubt if that overhead is worth it.

There has been discussion for some time about the desira-
bility of having the -shows- command show floating point
numbers which in fact represent integers (frac(x)=0)
as an integer (i.e., with no decimal point).

The effect of such a change on existing lessons is unknown;
however, it would probably benefit most lessons.

To give users a chance to look at this, there is now
available (right this very minute!) a special temporary
(test) version of -shows-, which you can reference by
writing "test" as the third argument. E.g.,
"shows x,4,test" will show an integer if frac(x)=0.

In fact, suppose only the one-argument -shows- dropped
the trailing zeros. The two-argument form would always
show the specified number of significant figures:

 shows v1   $$ if frac(v1)=0, don't show fraction
 shows v1,4 $$ always show 4 significant figures

Would that do it?

As to showing "3.500" as "3.5"--(I assume you want 3.512
to show as 3.512) that requires suppressing zeroes after
they have been generated, which is, of course, possible.

I would point out that if you have "3.500132", and you
do a "shows x", you will see "3.500"--now, do you want
at this point to suppress the trailing zeroes (which may
appear irrelevant when you see them) and show "3.5"?

Note that if you have 3.000132, the proposed shows
will still show you "3.000"---because "frac(x)" is not
zero.

Here is a list of various ways that individuals would
apparently like to show their numbers (in the context of
-shows-): have I missed your point of view?

1. Show "n" significant digits.

2. Same as (1), but show "integers" as integers.
       (Where frac(x)=0 for an "integer".)

3. Same as (1), but suppress trailing zeroes (after they
       have been generated).

As a first step, note that you should use

        A very long tag - occupying, say, 2 1/2 or 3
        screen lines, tho not rejected by the editor
        (or condensor), doesn't display right in

        believe that a tag could be that long, and
        places arrow within the previous line display
        - in fact, it seems to even show the line

would appear after insertion (or replacement) :

The problem with text display in the editor is merely one
of our having compromised occasional aesthetics for speed.
As has been said before, the editor uses "showa"s--which
do not update the screen position correctly, to save a few
msecs/sec (this is important). In your own programs, you
can spend your money and use an embedded "showa", which
does keep track of the screen position.

Result: we are not likely to increase the cost of the
editor.

The underlining problem is something else again.

As to underlining. I suggest that long underlines be
done by rdraw, rather than by backspaces and underscores;
don't all those backspaces ¬+ underscores take up more
space (if more than a few of them, anyway) than an
rdraw? I mean, space in ECS as well as on disk?

Execution of michael3 via the jumpout from galaxy results

out the ms/sec ratio implies that there is a rather tight
loop being executed. Since there is nothing in the code
which could do this -- they are both my lessons -- I can
only assume that something is awry in the calculation of
the ms/sec, or that the loop is in a system routine invoked

because too many people did not understand them. The dis-

can be stated in more detail as follows:
1) Professional author is a programmer employed for a par-
   ticular course or project to develop Plato programs (can
   be undergraduates, graduate students, high school stu-
   dents or faculty).
2) Student programmers are those who have been given the
   privilege of working on the system and are working in-
   dependently of a specific project.

This may be old ground revisited but has a mailbox facility
similar to the one in use in the arpa network been
considered for PLATO? In the arpa network it is a system
level function that when a person logs onto a computer he
is told whether he has a message. A message is sent to
someone by a special command "sndmsg" which is available
on what would be analogous to the plato "choose a lesson"
or "author" page. Each known user has a name used by him
at login and this is how he is identified as the recipient
of a message. Copies may be sent also to other users who
are identified at the same time as the primary recipient.
This greatly expedites the sending and receiving of info
and could be implemented in conjunction with itc or some
other currently avilable program. The recipient also may
elect not to read the message in which case he will be
reminded again next time he signs in.

it produces an odd-looking axis with only every other

prevent crowding and produce asthetically appealing axes,
but how then does one get larger consecutively numbered
axes? (aside from labeling them by hand) Could the

giving the author control of how the axes are labeled?

Ratings need not be made public...that is just for
the demo. Sign-on names would govern the finished version
so that a user could only see ratings he has made.
He would only see those he has added or modified listed

Corrections to the exposure level of individual frames of
a microfiche are done at CERL in consultation with the
user. The exposure modification algorithm currently in
use at CERL is considerably more complex than the one
you have suggested and as far as I can tell works quite
well.

   Doesn't appeal much to me personally...the BACK key
is now fairly far from the NEXT key and not likely to
be hit accidentally instead...when talking only ERASE
and NEXT have any use; I find the association of going
"back" to what I was doing plausible (more so than using
our home grown association of HELP1 with destruction).
   P.S. I think that activating the "E" option via HELP1
was a mistake...nothing is destroyed by that option...but
if I go to use it and accidentally miss the e and get the
d key instead...well...

I originally agreed with E being activated by HELP1 as
well as the talk disconnect. Maybe the accidental pressing
of "d" instead of "e" warrants some thought, but in both
cases I would rather have a shifted key do the activation.
Maybe LAB1 for the E option and BACK1 for the talk dis-
connect.

I would like to have something like a 'consult' option
for students:

Under what conditions could a lesson send a message
to a station which is not in the same lesson?

Essentially one could leave a human 'tutor's station
information in router common, and if a routed student
issues a term 'tutor' (or 'talk', etc.) the tutor
would get paged (while he might be authoring or
whatever), based on the information in router common.
Next, student and tutor could get together
through talkomatic, etc.

Would 'same course' or 'ext flags on' sound like a
reasonable restriction for allowing some message be
sent to an arbitrary station?

Could such a message be sent then through the press
command (bad) or through some 'send' command?

If a student needs help you branch him to

As long as you have your ext options on you will hear
a series of beeps when the student executes the help

After you hear the beeps you head for the communications

        The 'trouble sheet' for lesson repair is not
adequate for leaving an explanation of what is wrong
with a terminal. Maybe I'm long winded, but it seems
I can never get the message in that I want to express.
        Would like to see lesson repair replaced with
another section of notes that works like notes so that
we can communicate better with hardware people.
        This hypothetical section of notes could and
should also be used to announce terminal delivery
schedules or schedule changes....delivery priorities.....
new terminal installation etc. so that those of us in
charge of budgets for PLATO usage can keep up with what
is going on for planning purposes. Without such a facility
it degenerates to every man for himself trying to contact
the right people on the phone to get the info.

confusions or jealousies (sp?) or whatever. If that is the
case the notes could be locked so that only the originator
could read his note and any responses to it.
        The only fair alternative to remote users would
seem to be a toll free number they could call at CERL
to get the hardware or billing info they need. But that
would certainly bug the administrative people and the
hardware people continuously. I think the expansion
of notes for hardware and billing type info. is a better

unit you were in during failure, or anything along that
line. what we would like is a simple statement such as:
"blows up when drawing lines" or " bad characters" or
"violent explosion, then nothing" or whatever.
if you think that if might be the keyset, swap with
another terminal, temporarily, and see if it works then.
if you do this, return the keysets to their original
terminals when done.

Friday my terminal failed while I was out of town.
I came in sat. and made about five calls to CERL to locate
someone to report the problem. They left the message with
the operator. Came in sun. and the terminal was still
blitzed. I made about five more calls....finally got
rader to whom I was able to explain the nature of the
problem...how it has occured before....and suggested that
he have a look at the modem for our terminal. He went in
and flipped the modem off and back on. The problem was
cured. Took about 3 min. to fix. Took 2 days to get to
someone to fix it. I assume the hardware people would like
to be notified that such problems have arisen and been
fixed. I also assume they would like to know something
more than "off again, on again, gone again, Flannigan."

How about this:
        An option g under notes which works as follows.
An author leaves a message for a specific individual.
Thereafter, when he goes into g only he can edit, read,
or read replies to his note. The only other person able to
read or reply is the one to whom it is addressed.
The note remains until both parties have consented to its
deletion by pressing term wipeout after reading or replying,
or after 14 days.
After each time the note is edited or responded to again
by either party (including the first time). The other party
will be notified at signon that g note No.____ has been
updated when he hits term mail in author mode, or when he
signs on with his new 'mailbox' option on (accessed from
password page).
Term refer could pass it on to another who would be paged
in a similar manner at sign on.

currently treated.

If you need to type long notes on terminal problems,
how about just saying..."please see notes,part a for
further comments"...... then in notes(a) you can put
comments to your heart's content..... and without changing
the format of anything.

The type of notes I am suggesting is to enable dialogue
with responses back and forth as in this general interest
note. If the purpose were only to leave messages, what you
suggest would suffice. But it often takes an iterative/
approximation process to get the right info requiring
dialogue. Some feel (it seems) that such info should not
be advertised, yet phone calls are inefficient and expen-

     Even before the present pausing in the editor,

Sending a TV signal is very expensive in terms of
band-width. The Plato IV system was specifically

an ordinary telephone line in order to keep communications
cost down to a minumum.

For Plato V (maybe even Plato IV+) the engineers expect

I see. So it IS possible! that it is expensive
to send TV signals I knew. However a possible
idea would be to use a floppy disk or even maybe
better, a video tape machine, store signals and
call certain segments like the audio. Maybe even
short segments could be loaded from PLATO like a
charset. Once loaded, it could be repeatedly called
etc. Conceivably a "generator" lesson could be
used to rotate and move simple designs, transmit
them SLOWLY (if you call 2100 bps slow) via phone
to be shown at a standard rate. Thanks for the
info. Will think about it some more and let you

At the 8:55 Monday Morning ReLoad I received the same
error as was noted above. While editing, a charset in
this case, the New Plato will be loaded at 8:55 sign
flashed on the lower left and then after about 1 min.
BOOM. I lost all chars I had just edited. Was sent to
Improper security code with NO entry of the code, only
the message. Then to Press NEXT and "error too much
output accumulated" on each keypress until loaded.
Thought you might like to know circumstances so you could
find the bug in the editor. (By the way if you do find
the person that wrote the charset editor, ask him/her to
add previously requested option that during deletion, the
character to be deleted be shown. e.g. Press HELP1 to
delete =J=. )

     As a thought to the Data page. I feel that it might
be a reasonable feature to include a catagory (similar to
say discipline) which would give prerequisites that the
author feels are necessary for anyone using the lesson.?
     ?many authors write lessons, sparsely fill in the ?data
page and then leave the university with few, if any,
people knowing much more than the lesson name. ?in the
time span between lesson creation, finish, and use many
many details can be forgotten. ?in an effort that past

considered. ?

        The information you request does need to be provided
for every lesson, but I don't believe the data page is an
appropriate place. Data pages serve primarily to designate
ownership of lessons. The kind of information needed to
guess at the usefulness of a lesson belongs in a catalog
of lesson descriptions and, perhaps, in internal
documentation of the lesson. A few lines added to the data
page would not suffice even if authors took great care in
filling in data pages. As you have noted, they don't.

For the sake of clarity and efficiency we intend to
disallow student use of system variables such as "jcount".
If it is important for your students to be able to use
such names (with -store-, -ansv-, -ansu-, -compute-), you
will still be able to do this:

   define    student,jcount=jcount

This has the effect of putting the name "jcount" in the
student define set, with the meaning of the system
variable "jcount".

Such a change would appear to do violence to my lesson since

modify or delete items picked up in a storea. Restoring
the first ten characters of previous responses would
make this mode of response editing prohibitively expensive
for my purposes.

a further complaint on halfspace:
why does it not work in size¬=0?
this seems to be the case with all writing options
that involve a *font* character (e.g.locked shift-sup
and sub).
i know that sizing of special characters is not
allowed, but it seems that the *font* is the signal
that is prohibiting the use of these other features
as well.
how about figuring out some other scheme so that we
can use all of the features available...

---------- response 1
  03/11     14.15     judy       pso

The catch is that the other features are NOT available.

Writing in size¬=0 is completely different from writing
in size=0. In order to make the half-space available
in size¬=0 a modification will have to be made to a
whole complete systems sub-routine. (I'm sure that it
will be made....someday.) My point is that at the moment
other things are considered more important than a half-
space in size¬=0: such as more lesson space, better
spelling judging, improved key-echoing, .....

Do you mean "access" instead of "font"? A simple locked
super or sub works in size¬=0, but^ access locked super (to
go up a whole line) does not. Three locked supers in a
row will move one up 15/16 of a line. Won't that work
for most cases?

---------- response 2
  03/11     14.47     shlosberg       com

thanks for the explanation...?
yes, i guess i mean access instead of font (although
it did seem to me that anything that was either accessed
or fonted was not happening in size¬=0).
my list of things that presently do not work in size¬=0
includes:
  1)special characters
  2)access lock sup and sup
      (i.e. shift-square,shift-(sup$or$sub)
  3)half-space
this is probably not complete, but i think that
these are reasonable modifications of the present
sized writing repertoire. (at least the last two would
be nice)

---------- response 3
  03/11     15.03     b sherwood       phys

Points 2 and 3 will presumably be implemented eventually,
but sizing of charset characters is not possible due to
hardware limitations. It is conceivable that there might
eventually be a "line-mode" charset which could be sized.

There is an obvious need for sized characters: for

ability to use "sized writing"

appears to be acceptable. Very long condense times could
change this situation drastically. Are there any

        Nobody can answer your question about eventual wait

on. We get 20 condense requests per minute and it takes
1.6 seconds for an average condense! Authors will have to
condense shorter test lessons and less often. Students

No AIDS. First and foremost-- such copies would be stolen
and distributed and reproduced by totally uncontrolled
groups. (We have already seen "TUTOR manuals" by, say,
CAI research group of Podunk U.) The systems programmers
DO NOT WANT detailed printed material distributed until
the system settles down much more. The new INTRO stuff will
deal with -unit-, -draw-, -write-, -goto- etc. Those
commands are quite stable. But who knows what will happen
to -itoa-?

2) A print of "aids" would be unweildy and difficult to

A word of explanation: Back in the infancy of PLATO IV
charsets were not stored in individual's lessons, but in
central charset lessons--one went and asked Bill Golden for
a "charset space".

Lesson "charsets" is a remnant of this old system. It
contains a bunch of general charsets felt to be more-or-less
useful to plato users. Anyone is welcome to make use
of these charsets. In order to load a charset from
lesson "charsets", it is not necessary to specify the
lesson name --
charset random $$ these two forms are equivalent
charset charsets,random

I know everybody's busy, but....
We could certainly use a somewhat augmented set of -audio-
commands. The following 'commands' currently exist as
subroutines used by all our programs:

play track,sector,length $$ a real command

playh track,sector,length $$ invokes a time-locked pause
* of .36length seconds

play track,sector,length,endclock $$ like -play- above
* but assigns 'endclck' the reading that 'clock' will have
* when the message is complete (.36length sec.). this
* allows audio to be concurrent with screen animation yet
* lets program check for message completion

holdc endclck $$ a timelocked pause until 'clock'
* is greater than or equal to 'endclck'.

What is a 'regular' lesson, i,e.,
what is at least at present considered to be a
reasonable ms/sec ratio for lessons?

This question is prompted by the somewhat
shakey behaviour of notes, service, and SD/edit.
I would assume that these _are_ regular lessons,
yet they seem to be extremely troubled by the
new version of autobreak, e.g., on the main
display of either type of notes.

Currently there are some 120 users on the system.

such that I should not have expected them to work,
however, here we go:

S in one block of a lesson, some 15 words.
move to some other block of the same lesson.
E in that block, about half of it.
IS into that block, at the end.

Surely enough, the saved lines were gone.

No, I have not yet heard about the demolish file

maybe:

(a) document the options that compete for the save storage.
    (IBM would word the E option like 'the remainder
    of the block is saved and ...')

(b) show the amount of material saved (if any) in the
    title line of the line display; room could be made
    there by omitting LESSON BLOCK or abbreviating them.

(c) finally, use a shifted key, different from HELP
    to activate all options that clobber the save buffer.
    DATA1 would seem appropriate.

My apologies to Rick Blomme for the computerese in (a),
but computerese sounds better than no warning at all.

As for (c), maybe some poll of the using community
could be taken.

In the absence of any -inhibit erase- or -erase- statements
the panel is erased when you enter a new main unit. (A main
unit is a unit reached by a keypress or a -jump- command.)

If in unit a you have an -inhibit erase-, and then reach
unit b by pressing NEXT, then reach unit c by pressing
NEXT, unit a's display should be visible in a and b, but
erased when you reach c.

The situation cupec describes surprises me; I would
have predicted no erasing. I'll see what the systems
people say about it.

This problem has nothing to do with changes made this week.

The problem is that when a lesson goes into an "autobreak"
condition, keys other than -stop- or -stop1- will be ignored
(except that the last key pressed is saved).

Some thought is being given to a way of saving the first 4
keys before ignoring input.

---------- note 252 input keys
  03/13     09.44     eland     csa

In the not too distant past, it was possible to collect keys
of input before the screen had completed its display.
lately, this has not been true. At first I concluded that
the system was just particularly busy, and the above mode
of operation would soon return. However, some of the recent
notes seem to indicate that there is something more
fundamental behind the problem.?
If the system is indeed about to change its mode of
operation, could we be allowed the following option:?
Whereas in the past a "catchup" command could cause input
to be ignored until the screen display was complete, can
we have a "dontcatchup" command which _will_ allow keys to
be collected before the screen display is complete (and that
means also to collect keys during autobreak)?????
Without such an option, quick scanning through "pages" of
material is extremely tedious.

As usual, we guys here in the boonies have another

Better than I ever expected. (re. the message when
and what the system is doing). Would it be possible
to have some way of notifying us that say a lesson
has been listed or any other service as a matter of
fact has been taken care of. It is hard to tell in
most cases until the listing comes. Which is like
four days (average) to Iowa! That means before we
can essentially change a lesson, (and want a back up
listing) We must wait four days.
        One method might be to have a note here in
notes or special note system in "request". Or better
why not write a message to the person that requested
the listing (you keep the records of sign-on etc?)

Besides, with no change code, I can copy the lesson into
my workspace and thus "steal" something more valuable
than a hard copy of the lesson: a compileable, running
copy. If you don't have a vacant lesson space handy (ha!)
it can be messy to copy whatever bits and pieces you can
get into an almost full lesson.

It has always done the same for authors students, and

...Remember, as Bruce noted, that all old terminals will
automatically do a full screen erase (this is built in to
the hardware and not a programmed feature) if no change
has been made to the display for about 5 minutes. Hence,
a system "backout" after 10 minutes of inactivity is long
after the screen has gone blank anyway. We now at last
do have new terminals with the auto-erase time increased
to a more reasonable time approaching 30 minutes--and we
should probably now consider moving our programmed "backout"
time up also--does 15 or 20 minutes of inaction at a
terminal seem enough? (that means no key presses or
changes to the display for that period of time).

---------- response 8
  03/14     12.24     emg       mtcc

Would it be nightmarishly impossible to suspend programs
from ecs to disk after say 5 minutes thus conserving ecs
and still leaving the terminal so that a person "thinking"
or calculating or reading other material or talking to an
instructor or whatever could not lose his program status
but not waste tight resources at the same time? Maybe
a screen erase (panel saver) would be ok after 5 if, when
the original person(or whomever) came back he would get
a message such as "terminal in use, type STOP1 to use
or DATA and your password to continue". This would allow
people to go away and return if noone else needed the
terminal but would help prevent other people from fouling
up the students status or records if not necessary.
Are not most of the essential mechanisms necessary to do
this already in the system anyway?

     What are reactions to changing the message:

         Type in your security code

                   to

         Type in your change code

     Reason for request is confusion to new authors
     due to lesson DATA page referring to "change" code
     but entry page for code calling it "security" code.

     Trying to lessen confusion for new authors. . . .

Not good. When a new author wants to inspect====__=_______ a lesson,
the confusion comes back in full array when he is asked to
type in a _change_ code to inspect.
This seems to be a fault, not with the change code-inspect
code nomenclature, but with the confusion between "security
code" and "password" to enter. Perhaps what is needed is a
new and more descriptive name to replace "password". Perhaps
"entry code", or "entry password"? Suggestions?

---------- response 2
  03/13     19.43     paul       matha

        How about, simply, "Type in your codeword:"
(as distinguished from "password")? I.e., inspect codes,
change codes, etc., are examples of "codewords".
        Incidentally, the lesson DATA page _does_ refer to
these codes collectively as "SECURITY CODES."

we have long had multi problems with new authors trying
to distinguish between password and change codes, not to
mention confusion over exactly which code is changed if
the data page on a lesson is changed. i vote for
"entry password" or "sign-on password" (or something
equivalent) when the author signs on. perhaps data pages
could also be changed to read "lesson's change code" and
"lesson's inspect code" etc. new authors seem to feel they
are changing their own codes if they change the data page.

Although the confusion of authors may in fact be a problem,
it may also be worthwhile to consider the confusion of
students if anything were to change on their password pages.

Making sure that the "security code" is identified with the
lesson would, however, be helpful and harmless. --jim wilson

I agree with shlosberg, I like "Type your lesson's security
code". Incidentally, as the pedant-in-residence, I prefer
simply "Type..." rather than "Type in..."

  Alright, I can understand why authors can only condense
once every 45 sec.( We complain about 45 sec. while on
most systems the users are happy with 10 minute turn-
around times.) But, how come once I get the lesson
condensed I get "Lesson Deleted" instead of the usual
shift-stopping out? I mean, it used to do that once in
a while, but now it seems to be all the time? Thanks.

You mean you are having the lesson deleted from under you
because of ECS? What room do you work in? ECS-exceeded
deletions are site-dependent.
Or is the problem that you are not getting STOP1 type
deletes?

---------- response 2

I have been getting both types. After a -STOP1- deletion
I press -DATA- and go back into the lesson [with_out_
condensing]. After a "Deleted" message, the lesson has
to be recondensed, and the finish unit was _not_ executed.

---------- note 14 mode pages
  03/13     23.17     paul       matha

        What with the current "agony" over the student
mode page, here is a suggestion that took me a whole
45 seconds to think up:
        How about a dual author/student mode page, such
that the plasma panel is divided up into two halves. The
top half reads:

AUTHOR MODE

Choose a lesson to EDIT:

and the bottom half reads:

STUDENT MODE
         Choose a lesson to STUDY:

and each press of -NEXT- causes the top half to be erased
and the bottom half to appear, or vice versa. (or perhaps
just the arrows to flip-flop. (***continued***)

---------- response 1
  03/13     23.22     paul       matha

        The HELP key could take the student into a
display which could not only give the current options
but also explain the terms "student mode" and "author
mode." This type of dual mode page seems to me the
clearest method to demonstrate the duality of the modes,
and should be very helpful to new authors.

Any change in the format of these pages will have to
recognize that a full-screen erase is much faster than
a partial-screen (selective) erase. We certainly don't
want to slow things down!

---------- response 6
  03/14     11.20     paul       matha

        There would be full screen erases! But just
use the top half or the bottom half for each mode, thus
suggesting the difference between the modes. An
author would then not be as prone to type a lesson name
on the wrong page.

If you want to talk about awkward pages take a crack at
the author option page. Everyone here has expressed at
one time or another difficulty in pressing the right key
when shift-stopping out of a lesson as an author. NEXT
to edit is awkward when you are runninga program you
didnt write, and LAB DATA etc just dont suggest as names
what happens when you press them. I find that I usually
cannot decide on a key to press until i have read at
least several of these lines and the key words in the
explanatory sentences are at the end of the sentences.
How about changes to this page such as:
  NEXT--choose next lesson to run
  EDIT--edit this lesson
  SHIFT EDIT--edit another lesson
  BACK--go back to this lesson
  DATA--look at variable data
There must be other good ways but the present one, while
flexible is a constant thorn.

A note of interest to -transfr- users:

You cannot (successfully) move more than 2000 words in
a direct ecs-to-ecs data transfer, if the "to" and "from"
areas overlap, as the transfer is done in 2000 word (or
less) chunks.

We expect to take into account the direction of the transfer
(in the "near" future?), which will eliminate this
restriction.

---------- note 21 ansu
  03/14     04.16     mckeown       com

Maybe I am missing something, but ansu, etc. doesn't appear
to be handling some expressions the way I would expect.?
The expression: 3-2 f
is not judged ok by ?
ansu 1 f?
while (3-2) f is judged ok.?
I think I see the reason: You are interpreting the first
expression as a dimensionless 3 - 2 f which does not equal
1 f. Is this the case??
If it is, is there some way us non-science teachers can use
ansu to judge simple expressions such as this??
I realize that I can use *match* to get rid of the f and
then use *ansv*, but would obviously preeer to use *ansu*
which allows me to judge in one step instead of two.?
I really don't see any conflict with the use of ansu in
science lessons since I can't visualize a defined way of
interpreting 3-2 f other than assuming that the f was
intended to apply to the 3 also.

---------- response 1
  03/14     12.50     ruth       chem

You are right, 3-2f is being interpreted as 3-(2f).
When one is handling units in expressions, this is the
most reasonable thing for it to do.

Can't you use answer 1 f to do what you want?
(as long as you want to allow only simple mathematical
operations).

---------- response 2
  03/14     14.44     mckeown       com

I can't use *answer* because: 1--the numerical part of the
expression will be more complex than the answer command will
allow, and 2--the correct numerical answer is a randomly
generated number.?
It looks to me as if 3-2 f can have only one logical meaning
and that is (3-2) f. Any other interpretation I can think of
would be an error. Thus, the tradeoff appears to be whether
the science authors really need this expression type noted
as an error in the use of units. How do other authors feel
about this tradeoff? (I.e., how much would it bother the
science authors to have 3-2 f judged as (3-2) f, versus the
use other authors could make of ansu to make judging of
additive expressions with some dimensionality simpler?)?
Note to systems: Where is this numerical judging feature of
the answer command documented? I couldn't find it in aids.

I'd like to talk to you some more about your problem.
It may be that a -store until a non-numeric is met-
command is needed. How complicated do the expressions
get? We hope to jazz up the -answer- and -storen-
somewhat to handle expressions as complex as 3.7?10ˆ2ˆ3.....
And eventually have some kind of "answer ¬0v1¬1 apples"
for variable responses.

---------- response 4
  03/14     21.56     mckeown       com
First, I will try to get in touch with you in the near
future. Second, a typical expression would be:?
3044-(6718-6600)#(4350-3780)/(7200-6600) f?
although there are obviously many variations.
Most of your suggestions would be helpful. The?
answer ¬ov1¬1 apples?
would be most helpful in this situation.

Would it be possible to indicate to the author how many
seconds that he has to wait until his lesson will be
passed on to the condenser. This would probably cause
less overhead on the system because I for one would not
sit and continually press STOP1-NEXT, but would wait the
approximate time until the next attempt.

To the list mentioned by John Risken in GENERAL note ¬$75

micro, readset, and dataset? If these are also to be
transferred to the *obsolete* category, what will replace
them, especially in the case of variable based readset
commands?

(P.S. : Isn't it a little dangerous to plan on allowing
algorithmic jumps in a lesson; the unit naming conventions
may have to be changed....)

---------- response 1

        No changes are expected concerning unit names,
except, perhaps enforcement of the well established rule
of thumb that arithmetic operators should not be included.
Even this last restriction is unlikely.

you might try keeping all student data (updating after

I've lost track of the number of times that I pressed -BACK-
after setting some partial condense flags when my intent was
"I'm done now and returning back to where I was". Of course
the actual effect was to turn on all the condense flags, and
I had to go back and do everything all over again (with luck
I could remember which flags to turn off).?
May I suggest the following form for the partial condense
options:?
          Press -DATA- to turn all flags on
                -LAB- to turn all flags off
               block letter to switch flag
               -BACK- when finished?
With this mode of operation, what you see when you return
from your "editing" is what you get (more specifically, only
-BACK- gets out of the "flag setting" mode). Furthermore,
some flag setting is done easiest starting with all on, and
some with all off.

I agree also. I find myself sometimes doing this:
From block list page, I press p, then BACK to get all flags
on; then p and some block letters to get just a few off.
The suggestion would make this much simpler.

---------- response 1

It depends on what type of film you are using.
I suggest you get a light meter, or get hold of a 35mm
camera with one built in. That would be your best bet.

Using color film with an ASA rating of 125 (ie. High
Speed Ektachrome - Tungston) the exposure would be
1/4 of a second at f¬ 2.8, 1/8 of a second at f¬ 2, 1/15
of a second at f¬ 1.4. It is recommended that an indoor
type film is used to give the Plato display the proper
color. If you have any further questions feel free to
call Jim Glish at 333-1070 in Urbana (WILL-TV). We
have done both 35mm slides and 16mm movies of Plato
with much success.

---------- response 3

Most light meters are not reliable indicators of exposure
levels for plasma displays since light meters have spectral
sensitivities adjusted to about the center of the visible
spectrum. In addition, because most of the energy from
the display is in the red region, color film corrected
for 3200 or 3400¬0K sources has a lower relative speed than
daylight type film since such films are designed to correct
relative warm sources to daylight color balances. Aside
from exposure level, however, it makes little difference
what type of color film is use although the ASA index may
not reflect sensitivity in the red.

For a slide which looks a little red try Kodachrome II, 10
sec. at f8. If you like the slides a little more orange,
use Kodachrome X, 4 sec at f8.

Meters:
        In addition to the orange light put off by the
plamsa panel, the background will throw off meter readings.
A meter will read the screen as a whole + a true value for
the luminosity of the dots will be "watered" down by the
surrounding black background. When taking prints of some
displays last year, we couldnt get the meter to register
even when it was right on top of the screen! TomL

The idea is to reduce the amount of time the editor spends
processing and displaying. The space left in each block
might be useful occasionally, but many people feel that
it is not necessary to display it all the time. We could
put it back in. but then you would probably have a harder
time editing, with your keys being lost and having to wait
for displays to be plotted.

The space-left figure should be returned to the display page
for convenience in the "S"-"IS" operations often necessary
to pack code into tight lesson space. Without it, it becomes
necessary to do the extra keypress every time code is moved.
Perhaps the types "com","micro","chars",etc. could be
shortened. Also, the arrow and double star might not be
displayed without DATA1, since the author should remember
this information anyway.

   How hard would it be to make the -?- key work as it
is advertized to work in the editer? The help information
tells me that it is supposed to show me the next "screen

amount that your *L* is set to. Is it possible to add
12?1?0 to the amount that the editer would advance if you
pressed the -?- key each time you press a - -? Would such
a change, if possible, be agreeable to the rest of the
authors?
   Also: Since the editer now shows 12?1?0 more lines each
time you press the - -  bar, it might be nice to reflect
this change in the help sequence in the editer, instead
of saying that it shows "all lines on the display" when
you press - -.

 upon the new improvements in the editOr.
    Allow me to clarify my proposal:
   I have the default *L* value.
   I am looking at the first 8 lines of my block. I am
interested in what I see, so I push -space-. I now see the
first twenty lines in my block.
   I am now finished looking, and wish to proceed to the
next "screen full", so I push -?-. I now see the 8?ˆ_th_??
through 15?ˆ__==th?? lines of my block, which I have just finished
looking at.
   It would be nice if I saw the next "screen full" instead.

There have been several requests recently for some way to

This would allow bypassing a screen message ¬+ charset
command, instead of putting up the message for almost
instant erase (if the charset is already loaded). (Some
people know tricks to solve this problem, but good coding
shouln't depend on tricks, especially tricks that sometimes
quit working.)?
How about providing for this in the same way as the new
-from- works? I.e., a command such as
chartst n1;lesson1,block1;lesson2,block2;etc
wo??ld return -1 if neither charset is loaded, or 0,1,...
if one of the listed charsets is loaded, Of course, most
users would probably only code one charset name, so
the command might instead be
chartst lesson,block
with a test of -error- to determine the result of the test.?

one person's doings in your lesson, while saving others
changes, and the common hasn't been returned for their
records,all records (records,in this sense,meaning
student changes in your common) are lost.If no such
command exists,could you come up with one or a
selective abort? tnx

        Also, is there any way to delete the ECS copy
of a common? I had a problem with this:
I destroyed a common that I had made mistakes on,
copied the common back from a backup copy (same name)
and executed the lesson. Result? The ECS copy was
used, and returned to disc.
        I finally caught on and changed the name of
the common, but if it had been in use somewhere else,
I couldn't have done this.

Use the "abort common" command (which you term to, e.g.)
to get rid of the ecs copy.

No, there is no way in your program (aside from leaving
it) to force common to be returned; and the same for
selective return.

The recent change of the security code page will be a-help
to our new authors. Now that we can refer to the code needed
to get on the system as a "password", and the code needed to
inspect or change a lesson as a "codeword", we ought to have
less trouble with authors typing one in a space appropriate
to the other. This idea is still hard for them to grasp,
but at least they now have a better handle.

i don't mean to be a pest, but here is one more idea on
how to control the writing that is done while a charset is
being loaded. How about a -charu- command which would be
like an -eraseu- or -imain- so that whenever a charset was
loaded, the unit specified in the tag of the -charu- would
be executed. this seems much more straight foward than
my earlier suggestion about using -error-; and i would
hope that it would be simple enough to implement that
some kindly systems person might make time to do it.

Thanks for the insight. I wouldn't have felt so cheated

remaining info is most useful, and I, for one, would like
to see it displayed without having to SHIFT something,
e.g., like pressing the space bar. That action is one
I have been conditioned to perform when I want more

   Often, particularly when designing a title page, it is
desirous to center the material on the screen. It is hard
to do this, particularly when dealing with sizes. Why not
develop a "center" command? It would work like this:
     size    4
     write   ¬0at,10C¬1WELCOME¬0at,16C¬1<TO¬0at,22C¬1PLATO
     size    0
   The text would then be automatically centered (left and
right justified) on lines 10, 16, and 22.

---------- response 1
  03/19     13.48      warner       tutoring

This can be done quite simply. You simply write
your message at
100?line+32-(character count ? size / 2). I.E.
to write WELCOME in Size 2 centered on Line 10, it
is at 1032-^1=-=?2?2?7=1025. To display a judged string centered
on, say, 1332 in size 0, write at 1332-(jcount=2).
However, it would be convenient to have a centering
text option available in the ID-option of the
editor. This might be made to work on, say, SHIFT-T, so
that upon pressing SHIFT-T, an arrow appears at the
bottom left of the screen, one line of text is typed in.
and then the display length of the text is computed and
the text is shown centered on the current cursor position.
I gather this would take some effort, though. Anyone else
need this option?

   The formula for positioning a line works well, provided
you do not have narrow letters such as i or 1. In size 5,
for example, the formula given will NOT center a word such
as INDICATE. This requires the author to readjust all such
words for horizontal alignment.

Why not put a big message saying something like

at the end of the last page of the site display?
In that way, a user in a large site (like mine) could
know when to quit hitting NEXT on the site page without
having to compare the station numbers to see if they are
near the "beginning" or "end" of the site list. Since the
number of pages on the site display varies from moment to
moment, an indication that a site had come to an end would
prevent hitting NEXT and being autobreak-locked into a
page one really doesn't want to see!

It still appears to be the case that a response which
overflows it original line on the screen is not erased
properly if it is judged no and the student presses either
erase or shift erase. In these cases, the system appears to
erase as if the left margin of the second and succeeding
lines of the response was at the last at command. Since the
response has been placed on the screen with the left margin
controlled by the position of the arrow, this erase action
does not erase the last character(s) of the student response
Further, if the student (after erasing part of his response)
overflows the line again, his response is now set at the
left margin determined by the last at command. I believe
this problem worthy of some attention at the systems level
since it has the potential (and in certain lesson probable)
effect of leaving the screen pretty well messed up when
it happens a few times.

Would it be possible to provide some measure of system
loading so that one could guess his changes of being
flushed when ECS is overused at his site? It seems that
at times there is spare ECS from other sites that provides
some reasonable chance of getting thru a lesson, yet there
is no way for an author to know but to try. In my case
if I get flushed all the work is lost because common is
not updated. It can't be done automatically since it may
not always be in a stable state.

        I don't know how we could give you the information
you need, but we are considering a change which will reduce
the probability that an author is deleted.

        The fundamental soultion to your problem is to use
a student record if deletion will destroy your efforts. It
is harder to get in as a student, but once in, you won't be
deleted.

we just noticed that the time on the author mode page

be much easier for remote users to figure out the time.
Actually,why cant you just give all four time zones on

everywhere. Maybe you could even draw a clock for each
of us. We dont want much as you can see. But please
at least replace the decimal with a colon in the time

   Actually, the proper place to make this check is not in
the editOr, or any other TUTOR lesson.
   The best solution to this problem would be to have the
TUTOR executOr pass the correct local time to all fixed site
terminals in the date ¬+ clock commands.
   Note that fixing these commands so that they pass the
correct local time would fix the system time displays, as
well as solving the time-related problems for all TUTOR
lessons.
   This has an added advantage in that the average user who
is worried about changing 1300 to 1pm will not have to worry
about what time it REALLY is when it is 1300 Greenwich Mean
Time.
   Unfortunately, it is impossible to know where a dial-up
terminal is located, so they would presumably run on GMT.

Would this solution be agreeable with everyone?

If I store the date/time in common, (or anyplace for that

I agree with Marshall's reply.Every lesson using -clock-
would be messed up by a time zone adjusted clock.
If such a clock-type command were to be created I would
suggest that it be called -ztime- instead of -clock-.
Maybe ztime would have an optional second tag to specify
the zone you want returned.

        If you really want to get hairy, how about
a new command -lat- which returns local apparent time
instead of local mean time. no maybe -lat- should go with
-long- returning Lat and Long in degrees.

Change your codes during the SIGN-ON sequence...and you
will get complete privacy. The codes can be typed-in in
RECORDS since that is usually where a teacher puts in
his students...and little need for security is felt needed
for this situation.
(Of course, I assume you have not been tricked by someone
into "thinking" you were on the main sign-on page...but
were really in their lesson!)

If someone else has last edited a lesson you now try
to edit...you will be notified. The only change made...
was to not tell you that you changed the terminal that
you last edited the lesson...this information is available
on the lesson directory page however.

Is there any possibility that the operation of *concept*
commands will be modified to allow processing of other
judging commands following a sequence of *concept*s? In
particular, it gets to be pretty tiresome to have to put
in the universal wrong response in the *specs*. I can
understand, I think, why it is inconvenient (in the systems
sense) to go back to the original response and judge
conditional judging commands, but I would think it wouldn't
be too hard to pick up an unconditional judging command
since you don't even have to look at the response to
determine a branch.?
Please consider it, anyway.

---------- response 1
  03/22     00.25     tenczar       s

Well...I really cannot understand your statement...say more.

Someday, we will be able to inter-mix concept commands
with other judging commands.
BUT...it appears that if there is any error in "concepting"
the vocabulary, then an immediate exit will be done...at
least for a long time. The reason for this is that the
"common" usage of concept commands finds several hundred of
them in a row. If the student answer couldn't be
"concepted" by the vocabulary...then it would be a great
waste of time to proceed through all the concept commands.
Someday, we may "flag" where the end of this long list
of concept commands is...and proceed to there for the
possible finding of "other-type" answer commands.
Hey, that sounds pretty good...maybe it will be done sooner
than I thought!

---------- response 2
  03/22     17.07     mckeown       com

Your last thought does sound good, but, to explain my
original intent, I use *okxvocab* frequently because I am
only looking for the presence of certain keywords. If the
student enters no response, he goes to the *no* command
nicely, but if he enters a response which does not include
keywords from the vocab, he does not get to the *no*.
I would like the *no* to be active in that case also.
(Other judging commands active after
concept would be halpful also, but just ability to reach the
*no* would be very useful to me because the only way I see
to respond to the last case is a response in the *specs*.
Reaching *no* would also remove necessity of checking for
*anscnt*=-1 before setting bits in segment arrays, etc.)?
Maybe my problem is that I expect *okxvocab* to ignore any
term not in the vocabulary and it does not appear to operate
that way when no terms from the vocabulary are present

of "chartst charset-lesson,charset-block-name"--i.e.,
to look like the charset command itself. This command
would return in "error" whether the charset is loaded in
your terminal or not. (error=-1 if loaded, 0 if not)

make, if the message is two spaces to the left, or

i know that the accy 101 and 105 classes would love to have

Any group willing to purchase their own terminals has
full control over scheduling of those terminals. The
terminals in the library are being used as part of an
experiment in which open access is an important
requirement of the experimental design. Only time (and
data) will tell whether such a requirement is indeed
necessary for instruction. Al Avner

I would like to enter a request for a slight modification
of the computation of the value of the system variable,
*ntries*. Since ntries is defined in aids as "number of
attempts at the current arrow", it doesn't seem consistent
to increment ntries when a *judge restart* is executed. I
would think the most consistent way to interpret ntries
would be to increment it when the student indicated his
answer was ready for judging. In other words, ntries would
be the number of times the student thinks he has attempted
the arrow.?

didnt get to line 2 via the doto. Sometimes part of the
code within the loop is executed ; sometimes none.
         Could branching to the labelled line over the

   No, attempting to separate such cases would be a
terrible mess; perhaps an error could be generated if
you try to do a branch to the doto end statement from
outside the doto, but again the overhead to provide such
a check may simply take too much time and effort. Regard
doto loops as entities unto themselves; if you wish to
branch to the next statement following a doto, then by
all means put a label on that statement and branch to it!

--------- response 4
  03/28     08.21     cupec       csa

  Yes, I think the confusion here is that some are assuming
that the labeled statement ending the doto loop is not
part of the doto loop. It is, and like the previous
discussion about branching "inside" of a doto loop, it
should be illegal. Whether or not a check should be made
for it is a different story. On a system that is written
for everyone, not just computer people, all such obtuse
ideas might well be checked for. (Perhaps at condense
time) However, in the real world, not all is possible.

Even though I do it quite often, I still find it confusing

---------- response 1
  03/28     02.40     warner       tutoring

I support this change, as well as some other cleanups
in records. For instance, how about on the main page
letting DATA1 rather that LAB1 go to the data file?
This would be consistent with LAB for student vars
on the individual records page, as closely as is possible
without jeopardizing the "data page" convention.
Message-writing would then be linked to LAB1.
I'm sure these changes seem picky to you, but it is better
to get them done now than later, when authors have become
used to the present conventions and any rationalization
would cause protest! (Witness the change in notes...)

And fixing up the octal show so that it doesn't begin
autobreaking after only two pages. (Other octal show
routines don't seem thus affected).

And keeping the appropriate show type in effect between
router and sb variables, rather than switching back to v
format.

On the other hand, these things are all merely
inconveniences, not debilitating failures.

One more thing: when one is editing student
variables, one can enter the number of a variable not being
displayed and go directly to it. I usually do this to
inspect the variable; I back out without canging it.
But since I use the "change" routing to do this, I can't
do it while a student is running -- I have to wade through
the display of 75 variables instead. So...we need a way
to inspect a specific student variable while the student is
running. Just an inconvenience -- but a real one.

write   in a           at      2010
inhibit erase          write   in b
*                      end?
     If "a" is the first unit we reach during execution,
we get the string "in a" output at screen location 1010.
If a :term term" is then executed, the screen _clears_, and
the string "in b" shows up at location 2010.?

Is there some basic reason why, when you use the change
command, that the original is now flagged as an unrecognized
command? I can see why it would be easier to write the
routing this way, but was wondering if it is possible at all
to have both operative.
eg.
unit
change calc to clac
calc   n2?1
clac   n3?2

   The change command replaces the entry in the name table
with your new specification. Getting the proper condensing
and executing routines is thus no problem; to do otherwise
would practically require standing on one's head. P.S.
surely "change" means change??? Maybe you want a new
command called synonym??? (Its likelihood seems small.)

Not good.When a new author wants to inspect====__=_______ a lesson,
the confusion comes back in full array when he is asked to
type in a _change_ code to inspect.
This seems to be a fault, not with the change code—inspect
code nomenclature, but with the confusion between "security
code" and "password" to enter. Perhaps what is needed is a
new and more descriptive name to replace "password". Perhaps
!entry code", or "entry password"? Suggestions?

        How about, simply, "Type in your codeword:"
(as distinguished from "password")? I.e., inspect codes,
change codes, etc., are examples of "codewords".

these codes collectively as "SECURITY cODES."

we have long had multi problems with new authors trying
to distinguish between password and change codes, not to
mention confusion over exactly which code is changed if
the data page on a lesson is changed. i vote for
"entry password" or "sign-on password" (or something
equivalent) when the author signs on. perhaps data pages
could also be changed to read "lesson's change code" and
"lesson's inspect code" etc. new authors seem to feel they
are changing their own codes if they change the data page.

Although the confusion of authors may in fact be a problem,
it may also be worthwhile to consider the confusion of
students if anything were to change on their password pages.

Making sure that the "security code" is identified with the

        What with the current "agony" over the student

45 seconds to think up:
        How about a dual author/student mode page, such
that the plasma panel is divided up into two halves. The
top half reads:

AUTHOR MODE

Choose a lesson to EDIT:

and the bottom half reads:

STUDENT MODE
Choose a lesson to STUDY:

and each press of -NEXT- causes the top half to be erased
and the bottom half to appear, or vice versa. (or perhaps
just the arrows to flip-flop. (***continued***)

---------- response 1

      The HELP key could take the student into a
display which could not only give the current options
but also explain the terms "student mode" and "author
mode." This type of dual mode page seems to me the
clearest method to demonstrate the duality of the modes,
and should be very helpful to new authors.

      There would be full screen erases! But just
use the top half or the bottom half for each mode, thus
suggesting the difference between the modes. An
author would then not be as prone to type a lesson name
on the wrong page.

If you want to talk about awkward pages take a crack at
the author option page. Everyone here has expressed at
one time or another difficulty in pressing the right key
when shift-stopping out of a lesson as an author. NEXT
to edit is awkward when you are runninga program you
didnt write, and LAB DATA etc just dont suggest as names
what happens when you press them. I find that I usually
cannot decide on a key to press until i have read at
least several of these lines and the key words in the
explanatory sentences are at the end of the sentences.
How about changes to this page such as:
  NEXT--choose next lesson to run
  EDIT--edit this lesson
  SHIFT EDIT--edit another lesson
  BACK--go back to this lesson

  DATA--look at variable data
There must be other good ways but the present one, while
flexible is a constant thorn.

A note of interest to -transfr- users:

You cannot (successfully) move more than 2000 words in

---------- note 21 ansu
  03/14     04.16     mckeown       com

Maybe I am missing something, but ansu, etc. doesn't appear
to be handling some expressions the way I would expect.?
The expression: 3-2 f
is not judged ok by ?
ansu 1 f?
while (3-2) f is judged ok.?
I think I see the reason: You are interpreting the first
expression as a dimensionless 3 - 2 f which does not equal
1 f. Is this the case??
If it is, is there some way us non-science teachers can use
ansu to judge simple expressions such as this??
I realize that I can use *match* to get rid of the f and
then use *ansv*, but would obviously prefer to use *ansu*
which allows me to judge in one step instead of two.?
I really don't see any conflict with the use of ansu in
science lessons since I can't visualize a defined way of
interpreting 3-2 f other than assuming that the f was
intended to apply to the 3 also.

---------- response 1
  03/14     12.50     ruth       chem

You are right, 3-2f is being interpreted as 3-(2f).
When one is handling units in expressions, this is the
most reasonable thing for it to do.

Can't you use answer 1 f to do what you want?
(as long as you want to allow only simple mathematical
operations).

---------- response 2
  03/14     14.44     mckeown       com

I can't use *answer* because: 1--the numerical part of the
expression will be more complex than the answer command will
allow, and 2--the correct numerical answer is a randomly
generated number.?
It looks to me as if 3-2 f can have only one logical meaning
and that is (3-2) f. Any other interpretation I can think of
would be an error. Thus, the tradeoff appears to be whether
the science authors really need this expression type noted
as an error in the use of units. How do other authors feel
about this tradeoff? (I.e., how much would it bother the
science authors to have 3-2 f judged as (3-2) f, versus the
use other authors could make of ansu to make judging of
additive expressions with some dimensionality simpler?)?
Note to systems: Where is this numerical judging feature of
the answer command documented? I couldn't find it in aids.

I'd like to talk to you some more about your problem.
It may be that a -store until a non-numeric is met-

get? We hope to jazz up the -answer- and -storen-

3044-(6718-6600)?(4350-3780)/(7200-6600) f?
although there are obviously many variations.

answer ¬0v1¬1 apples?
would be most helpful in this situation.

I've lost track of the number of times that I pressed -BACK-
after setting some partial condense flags when my intent was
"I'm done now and returning back to where I was". Of course
the actual effect was to turn on all the condense flags, and
I had to go back and do everything all over again (with luck
I could remember which flags to turn off).?
May I suggest the following form for the partial condense
options:?
          Press -DATA- to turn all flags on
                -LAB- to turn all flags off
                block letter to switch flag
                -BACK- when finished?
With this mode of operation, what you see when you return
from your "editing" is what you get (more specifically, only
-BACK- gets out of the "flag setting" mode). Furthermore,
some flag setting is done easiest starting with all on, and
some with all off.

I agree also. I find myself sometimes doing this:
From block list page, I press p, then BACK to get all flags
on; then p and some block letters to get just a few off.

---------- response 1

It depends on what type of film you are using.
I suggest you get a light meter, or get hold of a 35mm
camera with one built in. That would be your best bet.

---------- response 2
  03/15     13.21     glish       itv

Using color film with an ASA rating of 125 (ie. High
Speed Ektachrome - Tungston) the exposure would be
1/4 of a second at f¬ 2.8, 1/8 of a second at f¬ 2, 1/15
of a second at f¬ 1.4. It is recommended that an indoor
type film is used to give the Plato display the proper
color. If you have any further questions feel free to
call Jim Glish at 333-1070 in Urbana (WILL?TV). We
have done both 35mm slides and 16mm movies of Plato
with much success.

---------- response 3
  03/15     14.03     stan       chem

Most light meters are not reliable indicators of exposure
levels for plasma displays since light meters have spectral
sensitivities adjusted to about the center of the visible
spectrum. In addition, because most of the energy from
the display is in the red region, color film corrected
for 3200 or 3400-0K sources has a lower relative speed than
daylight type film since such films are designed to correct
relative warm sources to daylight color balances. Aside
from exposure level, however, it makes little difference
what type of color film is use although the ASA index may
not reflect sensitivity in the red.

For a slide which looks a little red try Kodachrome II, 10
sec. at f8. If you like the slides a little more orange,
use Kodachrome X, 4 sec at f8.

Meters:

   In addition to the orange light put off by the
plamsa panel, the background will throw off meter readings.
A meter will read the screen as a whole + a true value for
the luminosity of the dots will be "watered" down by the
surrounding black background. When taking prints of some
displays last year, we couldnt get the meter to register

The idea is to reduce the amount of time the editor spends

might be useful occasionally, but many people feel that
it is not necessary to display it all the time. We could

The space-left figure should be returned to the display page
for convenience in the "S"-""IS" operations often necessary
to pack code into tight lesson space. Without it, it becomes
necessary to do the extra keypress every time code is moved.
Perhaps the types "com","micro","chars",etc. could be
shortened. Also, the arrow and double star might not be
displayed without DATA1, since the author should remember
this information anyway.

   How hard would it be to make the -?- key work as it

tells me that it is supposed to show me the next "screen

amount that your *L* is set to. Is it possible to add
12?1?0 to the amount that the editer would advance if you
pressed the -?- key each time you press a - -? Would such
a change, if possible, be agreeable to the rest of the
authors?
   Also: Since the editer now shows 12?1?0 more lines each
time you press the - - bar, it might be nice to reflect
this change in the help sequence in the editer, instead
of saying that it shows "all lines on the display" when

Mrs. Sherwood:
    The change that I propose which, contrary to popular

 upon the new improvements in the editOr.
    Allow me to clarify my proposal:
   I have the default *L* value.
   I am looking at the first 8 lines of my block. I am
interested in what I see, so I push -space-. I now see the
first twenty lines in my block.
   I am now finished looking, and wish to proceed to the
next "screen full", so I push -?-. I now see the 8?ˆ_th_??
through 15?ˆ__==th?? lines of my block, which I have just finished
looking at.
   It would be nice if I saw the next "screen full" instead.

There have been several requests recently for some way to

This would allow bypassing a screen message ¬+ charset
command, instead of putting up the message for almost
instant erase (if the charset is already loaded). (Some
people know tricks to solve this problem, but good coding
shouln't depend on tricks, especially tricks that sometimes
quit working.)?
How about providing for this in the same way as the new
-from- works? I.E., a command such as
chartst n1;lesson1,block1;lesson2,block2;etc
wo??ld return -1 if neither charset is loaded, or 0,1,...
if one of the listed charsets is loaded. Of course, most
users would probably only code one charset name, so
the command might instead be
chartst lesson,block
with a test of -error- to determine the result of the test.?
Either of the above would be a great improvement over the

of "chartst charset-lesson,charset-block-name"--i.e.,
to look like the charset command itself. This command
would return in "error" whether the charset is loaded in

I think I said a while back that something like this will

we might find a better way a few days later, and everyone

Is there a command us regular people can use to return
commons to disk in our programs (sort of the opposite of
abort common,something like return common)?
One often forgets to return the things through
the feature in student mode,and if you want to abort
one person's doings in your lesson,while saving others
changes,and the common hasn't been returned for their
records,all records (records,in this sense,meaning
student changes in your common) are lost.If no such
command exists,could you come up with one or a
selective abort? tnx

        Also, is there any way to delete the ECS copy
of a common? I had a problem with this:
I destroyed a common that I had made mistakes on,
copied the common back from a backup copy (same name)
and executed the lesson. Result? The ECS copy was
used, and returned to disc.
        I finally caught on and changed the name of
the common, but if it had been in use somewhere else,
I couldn't have done this.

Use the "abort common" command (which you term to, e.g.)
to get rid of the ecs copy.

No. there is no way your program (aside from leaving
it) to force common to be returned; and the same for
selective return.

The recent change of the security code page will be a help

to get on the system as a "password", and the code needed to
inspect or change a lesson as a "codeword", we ought to have
less trouble with authors typing one in a space appropriate
to the other. This idea is still hard for them to grasp,

i don't mean to be a pest, but here is one more idea on
how to control the writing that is done while a charset is
being loaded. How about a -charu- command which would be
like an -eraseu- or -imain- so that whenever a charset was
loaded, the unit specified in the tag of the -charu- would
be executed. this seems much more straight foward than
my earlier suggestion about using -error-; and i would
hope that it would be simple enough to implement that
some kindly systems person might make time to do it.

   Often, particularly when designing a title page, it is
desirous to center the material on the screen. It is hard
to do this, particularly when dealing with sizes. Why not
develop a "center" command? It would work like this:
    size   4
    write  ¬0at,10<¬1WELCOME¬0at,16C¬1T<¬0at,22<¬1PLATO
    size
   The text would then be automatically centered (left and
right justified) on lines 10, 16, and 22.

---------- response 1
  03/19  13.48  warner    tutoring

This can be done quite simply. You simply write
your message at
100?line+32-(character count ? size / 2). I.E.
to write WELCOME in Size 2 centered on Line 10, it
is at 1032-ˆ1=-=?2?2?7=1025. To display a judged string centered
on, say, 1332 in size 0, write at 1332-(jcount=2).
However, it would be convenient to have a centering
text option available in the ID-option of the
editor. This might be made to work on, say, SHIFT-T, so
that upon pressing SHIFT-T, an arrow appears at the
bottom left of the screen, one line of text is typed in,
and then the display length of the text is computed and
the text is shown centered on the current cursor position.
I gather this would take some effort, though. Anyone else
need this option?

  The formula for positioning a line works well, provided
you do not have narrow letters such as i or 1. In size 5,
for example, the formula given will NOT center a word such
as INDICATE. This requires the author to readjust all such
words for horizontal alignment.

In that way, a user in a large site (like mine) could
know when to quit hitting NEXT on the site page without
having to compare the station numbers to see if they are
near the "beginning" or "end" of the site list. Since the

prevent hitting NEXT and being autobreak-locked into a

  03/21     02.15     mckeown       com

It still appears to be the case that a response which
overflows its original line on the screen is not erased
properly if it is judged no and the student presses either
erase or shift erase. In these cases, the system appears to
lines of the response was at the last at command. Since the
response has been placed on the screen with the left margin
controlled by the position of the arrow, this erase action
does not erase that last character(s) of the student response
Further, if the student (after erasing part of his response)
overflows the line again, his response is now set at the
left margin determined by the last at command. I believe
this problem worthy of some attention at the systems level
since it has the potential (and in certain lessons probable)
effect of leaving the screen pretty well messed up when
it happens a few times.

Would it be possible to provide some measure of system
loading so that one could guess his chances of being
flushed when ECS is overused at his site? It seems that
at times there is spare ECS from other sites that provides
some reasonable chance of getting thru a lesson, yet there
is no way for an author to know but to try. In my case
if I get flushed all the work is lost because common is
not updated. It can't be done automatically since it may
not always be in a stable state.

        I don't know how we could give you the information
you need, but we are considering a change which will reduce
the probability that an author is deleted.

   Actually, the proper place to make this check is not in
the editOr, or any other TUTOR lesson.
   The best solution to this problem would be to have the
TUTOR executOr pass the correct local time to all fixed site
terminals in the date ¬+ clock commands.
   Note that fixing these commands so that they pass the
correct local time would fix the system time displays, as
well as solving the time-related problems for all TUTOR
lessons.
   This has an added advantage in that the average user who
is worried about changing 1300 to 1pm will not have to worry
about what time it REALLY is when it is 1300 Greenwich Mean
Time.
   Unfortunately, it is impossible to know where a dial-up
terminal is located, so they would presumably run on GMT.

  Would this solution be agreeable with everyone?

If I store the date/time in common, (or anyplace for that

I agree with Marshall's reply.Every lesson using -clock-
would be messed up by a time zone adjusted clock.
If such a clock-type command were to be created I would
suggest that it be called -ztime- instead of -clock-.
Maybe ztime would have an optional second tag to specify
the zone you want returned.

        If you really want to get hairy, how about
a new command -lat- which returns local apparent time
instead of local mean time. no maybe -lat- should go with
-long- returning Lat and Long in degrees.

Change your codes during the SIGN-ON sequence...and you
will get complete privacy. The codes can be typed-in in
RECORDS since that is usually where a teacher puts in
his students...and little need for security is felt needed
for this situation.
(Of course, T assume you have not been tricked by someone
into "thinking" you were on the main sign-on page...but
were really in their lesson!)

If someone else has last edited a lesson you now try
to edit...you will be notified. The only change made...
was to not tell you that you changed the terminal that
you last edited the lesson...this information is available
on the lesson directory page however.

Is there any possibility that the operation of *concept*
commands will be modified to allow processing of other
judging commands following a sequence of *concept*s? In
particular, it gets to be pretty tiresome to have to put
in the universal wrong response in the *specs*. I can
understand, I think, why it is inconvenient (in the systems
sense) to go back to the original response and judge
conditional judging commands, but I would think it wouldn't
be too hard to pick up an unconditional judging command
since you don't even have to look at the response to
determine a branch.?
Please consider it, anyway.

---------- response 1
  03/22     00.25     tenczar       s

Well...I really cannot understand your statement...say more.

Someday, we will be able to inter-mix concept commands
with other judging commands.
BUT...it appears that if there is any error in "concepting"
the vocabulary, then an immediate exit will be done...at
least for a long time. The reason for this is that the
"common" usage of concept commands finds several hundred of
them in a row. If the student answer couldn't be
"concepted" by the vocabulary...then it would be a great
waste of time to proceed through all the concept commands.
Someday, we may "flag" where the end of this long list
of concept commands is...and proceed to there for the
possible finding of "other-type" answer commands.
Hey, that sounds pretty good...maybe it will be done sooner
than I thought!

---------- response 2
  03/22     17.07     mckeown       com

Your last thought does sound good, but, to explain my
original intent, I use *okxvocab* frequently because I am
only looking for the presence of certain keywords. If the
student enters no response, he goes to the *no* command
nicely, but if he enters a response which does not include
keywords from the vocab, he does not get to the *no*.
I would like the *no* to be active in that case also.
(Other judging commands active after
concept would be helpful also, but just ability to reach the
*no* would be very useful to me because the only way I see
to respond to the last case is a response in the *specs*.
Reaching *no* would also remove necessity of checking for
*anscnt*=-1 before setting bits in segment arrays, etc.)?
Maybe my problem is that I expect *okxvocab* to ignore any
term not in the vocabulary and it does not appear to operate
that way when no terms from the vocabulary are present

All my lessons using this command were working all right
till March 21. Now the bar is being drawn, but the
location of the bar is not right. One of the lessons using
this command is 'tsmdl', block 'h'.

To AIDS authors

        Write up on ITOA command is misleading to me.
On first reading and second and third i though that
itoa would allow me to put a number into one variable
and get it's alphanumeric equivalent in another.
        This is not so!

        Also one can reach the ITOA via the data key and
 typing IOT_A=_ . This is not an acceptable form of ITOA.

This appears to be a reasonable suggestion--I would like
to implement -chartst- (or -charchk-?) in the simple form
of "chartst charset-lesson,charset-block-name"--i.e.,
to look like the charset command itself. This command
would return in "error" whether the charset is loaded in
your terminal or not. (error=-1 if loaded, 0 if not)

      please move the" end of talk " few spaces
      to the right so it does not overwrites
      the name of the pager.
      it often happens that one is looking at
      a note or a hard copy on the side for 3
      min. when he turns back to the term. he sees

 I don't think that the END OF TALK display warrents

here are just TRIVIA. Anyway what difference does it
make, if the message is two spaces to the left, or
"very irritating" it can be tolarated.

The econ108 terminals belong to that department, I

...which leads to the question of how one department can
obtain monopolistic rights over terminals (especially
when they seem to receive such light usage.)
i know that the accy 101 and 105 classes would love to have
access to some terminals on the south end of campus (and i'm
sure there are others with similar desires) but even when
there is noone on the econ terminals, they are not available
for others.

Any group willing to purchase their own terminals has
full control over scheduling of those terminals. The
terminals in the library are being used as part of an
experiment in which open access is an important
requirement of the experimental design. Only time (and
data) will tell whether such a requirement is indeed
necessary for instruction. Al Avner

I would like to enter a request for a slight modification
of the computation of the value of the system variable,
*ntries*. Since ntries is defined in aids as "number of
attempts at the current arrow", it doesn't seem consistent
to increment ntries when a *judge restart* is executed. I
would think the most consistent way to interpret ntries
would be to increment it when the student indicated his
answer was ready for judging. In other words, ntries would
be the number of times the student thinks he has attempted
the arrow.?

The following code:

gives unreliable results when the branch is executed to line
2.  The doto test is apparently bein done even though I
didnt get to line 2 via the doto. Sometimes part of the
code within the loop is executed ; sometimes none.
        Could branching to the labelled line over the
doto be implemented (where the labeled line is condensed
as a dummy rather than the loop test) ? Or at least a
statement (or warning) of what to expect. TomL

---------- response 3
  03/27     21.16     blomme       s

   No, attempting to separate such cases would be a
terrible mess; perhaps an error could be generated if
you try to do a branch to the doto end statement from
outside the doto, but again the overhead to provide such
a check may simply take too much time and effort. Regard
doto loops as entities unto themselves; if you wish to
branch to the next statement following a doto, then by
all means put a label on that statement and branch to it!

---------- response 4
  03/28     08.21     cupec       csa

  Yes, I think the confusion here is that some are assuming
that the labeled statement ending the doto loop is not
part of the doto loop. It is, and like the previous
discussion about branching "inside" of a doto loop, it
should be illegal. Whether or not a check should be made
for it is a different story. On a system that is written
for everyone, not just computer people, all such obtuse
ideas might well be checked for. (Perhaps at condense
time) However, in the real world, not all is possible.

Even though I do it quite often, I still find it confusing
to press LAB for _data_ options and DATA for student variables
in course records. Could pressing DATA give one the
data options?

---------- response 1
  03/28     02.40     warner       tutoring

I support this change, as well as some other cleanups
in records. For instance, how about on the main page
letting DATA1 rather that LAB1 go to the data file?
This would be consistent with LAB for student vars
on the individual records page, as closely as is possible
without jeopardizing the "data page" convention.
Message-writing would then be linked to LAB1.
I'm sure these changes seem picky to you, but it is better
to get them done now than later, when authors have become
used to the present conventions and any rationalization
would cause protest! (Witness the change in notes...)

to template non-existent record numbers?

And fixing up the octal show so that it doesn't begin
autobreaking after only two pages. (Other octal show
routines don't seem thus affected).

And keeping the appropriate show type in effect between
router and sb variables, rather than switching back to v
format.

On the other hand, these things are all merely
inconveniences, not debilitating failures.

One more thing: when one is editing student
variables, one can enter the number of a variable not being
displayed and go directly to it. I usually do this to
inspect the variable; I back out without changing it.
But since I use the "change" routine to do this, I can't
do it while a student is running -- I have to wade through
the display of 75 variables instead. So...we need a way
to inspect a specific student variable while the student is
running. Just an inconvenience -- but a real one.

     Again I bring up the fact that inhibit erase does
not work when you term to another unit; witness:?
unit       a                unit      b
at         1010             term      term
write      in a             at        2010
inhibit    erase            write     in b
*                           end?
     If "a" is the first unit we reach during execution,
we get the string "in a" output at screen location 1010.
If a "term term" is then executed, the screen _clears_, and
the string "in b" shows up at location 2010.?
     What's the problem? Or if that's how it is supposed
to be documentation is the only answer. (That's not

        It will cycle through all the entries only after
cycling through all the blocks.

  Bug in 3-arg show?

  show .411,-0,3    $$ no error
  show 411,3,-0     $$ execution error -
                    $$    no type given

  It would be extremely helpful if (-0) was acceptable
  as either argument.

A -0 as the third argument will be treated as a 0 as of
the next time PLATO comes up. Thank you.

---------- note 386 aarrow
  03/28     16.03     ecs       mtcc

when a student pushes -help- at an arrow, aarrow is appar-
ently incremented when the student comes out of the help
sequence to the same arrow.  this often causes some problem
with the reliability of the ratio of correct responses
to arrows, etc. I realize a criticism would be that an
author should know how many arrows are in a given area in
his/her lesson, but when you're trying to draw conclusions
from data for lessons you didn't write, this presents a
problem. can or should this be changed? other authors
care to comment?

It would seem that aarrow should be incremented only
after the student has actualy pressed one of the judging
keys in effect at that arrow.

Did you know that you can edit your own note by going to
that note and pressing EDIT1? Looks as you could have
used that here....

---------- note 391 clac
  03/28     22.44     rowell       m

Is there some basic reason why, when you use the change
command, that the original is now flagged as an unrecognized
command? I can see why it would be easier to write the
routine this way, but was wondering if it is possible at all
to have both operative.

eg.
unit
change calc to clac
calc    n2?1
clac    n3?2
right now, calc is flagged. ( this was brought up in
the responses to gen. note ¬$289)

   The change command replaces the entry in the name table
with your new specification. Getting the proper condensing
and executing routines is thus no problem; to do otherwise
would practically require standing on one's head. P.S.
surely "change" means change??? Maybe you want a new
command called synonym??? (Its likelihood seems small.)

Sorry I caused confusion.... you are supposed to have
only one name at a time....

Right, thought it might be a table substitution.
You are also right in that a "synonym" command would be
nice, but I can see the great difficulty in setting it up.
thanks anyway.
