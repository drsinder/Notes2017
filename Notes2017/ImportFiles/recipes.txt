I made this recipe.  At first, I thought the sauce was too
thin, but now I realize that it thickens after it's poured
over the enchiladas and baked.  If I make it again, I will
probably add salt and pepper (perhaps other seasonings, as
well) and sauteed onions and peppers to the ground beef.  
It is a good basic recipe.  I served it with sour cream--I
think chopped green onions would be good as a garnish.

There is a difference between green chilies and jalapenos.
Jalapenos are much hotter and are shorter in length.  Both
are sold fresh and canned.  You may need to try several
different brands before you find one that you are happy
with for taste.

9/3/95    12:55 pm PDT    richard / uci
 
The chilies you are looking for are the Anaheim variety, in
some circles, known as Ortega chilies. They are fairly mild
and can be purchased in most stores in the canned Mex food
section or you can buy them fresh in the veggie section of

the market.
 
If you buy them fresh, you have to cook them. It isn't
hard, but may gross you out the first time. The results are
orth it, however. Take the entire chile (no cuts or holes)
and lay it over an open flame until the waxy, outer skin is
black and bubbled... kinda like second and third-degree
burns. The chile will expand and start hissing. That is
fine. Once it has been blackened and blistered, place the
chile under cold running water and peel off the outer skin.
Using a paper towel, dry the chile and then slit it and
pull out the seeds. For guacamole, cut the stem off and
then dice the chile and stick it in the dip.
 
You can also make a mean chile relleno by leaving the stem
on and filling the cavity(minus the seeds) with Jack Cheese
and covering it with whipped egg and flour batter and then
frying it in a pan.
 
One word of caution: Wash your hands after handling the
chile. If you rub your eyes, you will find out why!

I love to cook fast food, because I never have any time.
I've found that couscous is great, but bland sometimes.
Any way to spark it up, without too many ingredients?
 
Another fave is angel hair pasta, but it generally lends
itself to "Italian type sauces".  Any other quick ideas.
 
Finally, I am enamored with cellophane noodles (saifun), but
can't find any recipes that don't  call for scads of 
additional ingredients, like chicken, pork, cabbage, bean
sprouts, along w/ all sorts of exotica like fish sauce.
Any quick way to make something delicious, without having
to buy 55 ingredients?  
 
I generally have in the house;  onions, canned tomatoes, 
canned mushrooms, soy sauce, sesame oil, broth or boullion,
only rarely do I have meat, leftover or otherwise.  I only
buy celery rarely.  I've always got lots of herbs and 
spices, and some kind of cheese, too, and always parmesan.

~1.5 C couscous (preferably WW)
1 can no fat chicken or vegetable broth (~2 C)
1 bay leaf, preferably "fresh"
onion powder/garlic powder/ground cumin to taste
 
Put broth in a microwave safe container with bay leaf,
cover and bring to a boil in a wave oven (~4 mins).
 
Meanwhile, place couscous, op, gp, cumin (or whatever) in a
shallow dish/pan (9" x 13" is good, but use what you have),
mix and spread out.  When the broth is boiling, pour over
the couscous, stir and cover for ~12 minutes.  Fluff with a
serving fork and serve.  This can accompany a lot of
different things, but is especially good with stir fried
veggies.

If you want to die young, but have fun in the meantime,
here's the B-Bar-B Praline Squares
 
2 sticks of butter
1 box of brown sugar (2 1/4 cups packed)
  Melt these two ingredients together in double boiler.  
Let set for 15 minutes.
 
Add:
1 1/2 cups of flour
2 well beaten eggs
1/4 tsp of salt
1 tsp. vanilla
1 cup of nuts

Pour into greased and loured 9 x 13 pan.  Bake 30 minutes
at 350.  After 20 minutes cut into squares.  Let cool a bit
and then take out with a spatula.  This is a cookie that
tastes almost like candy.  (If butter, eggs, sugar, etc.
make you feel depressed, just eat all you want and then
ride an extra 100 miles on your bike this week)

I just canned some salsa last night.  The recipe is from
the Ball Blue Book.  This makes 6 - 7 pints.
 
10 cups chopped tomatoes
5 cups chopped onion
5 cups chopped long green peppers
2 1/2 cups chopped hot peppers [I used 1 1/2 cup jalepenos]
1 1/4 cup cider vinegar
2 tbsp minced cilantro
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp salt
1 tsp Tabasco (optional)
 
Combine everything in a large pot.  Bring to a boil, reduce
heat, and simmer 10 minutes.  Pour into clean, hot pint
jars, with lids and rings and process in a boiling water

bath for 15 minutes.
 
If you aren't planning on canning it, you could decrease/
leave out the vinegar.  But if you do can it, the vinegar
provides enough acid to keep bacteria from growing.
 
If you need more explicit canning directions, let me know.
The Ball Blue Book is good, as is the book _Putting Food
By_, available at your local library or bookstore.

Here's a easy salsa recipe:
Ingredients:For a small bowl
 
15 ripe roma tomatoes(can substitute out of your garden)
1  white onion
2-3 Jalapenos (more if you want it Hot!)
A little bit of fresh cilantro
Salt, pepper, & Garlic salt for taste
 
 
Begin by using a chopper or food processer to puree the
tomatoes.  Pour into a bowl.  Do the same with the onion,
jalapenos, and cilantro.  Then add your salt, pepper, and
garlic salt to taste.
 
**If you do not want fresh salsa you can make it by using 3
cans of Hunts whole peeled tomatoes.

----My Favorite Cheesecake
 
3/20/97    8:18 pm CST    roberts / chemproc
 
I love good recipies but I won't make it if it's not also
quick and easy to clean up.  This one is all three.
 
"Sugar Free/Low Fat Cheese Cake"
 
Crust:
2 c. graham cracker crumbs (There is a small amount of
    sugar in graham crackers, Honey Maid Grahams have the
    lowest content I have found.)
1/4 c. butter, melted
1 Tbsp. fructose crystals (or substitute equivalent to 1/3
    c. sugar)
 
Combine ingredients and press into a pie pan with a spoon
or measuring cup.
 
Filling:
1 pkg 8 oz. Neufachel Cheese
8 oz. yogurt - sugar free/no sugar added
2 eggs
1/3 c. fructose crystals (or substitute equivalent to 1/2
    c. sugar)
 
Mix all ingredients until smooth.  Pour into crust and bake
at 325 for 60 minutes or until knife inserted in middle
comes out clean.
 
Baking time will vary with the amount of liquid in the
yogurt.  Check pie regularly after 40 minutes. A 75 minute
baking time is not uncommon.
 
*note: fructose browns quickly at high temperatures, as do
many sweeteners.  Watch pie and cover with foil if it is
browning too quickly.
 
Tipps:
Use a flavored yogurt for variety.  I like Breyers
Blueberry yogurt.  Coffee and chocolate yogurts as well as
other fruit flavors are also good.
 
Try adding a layer of fresh fruit or all-fruit spread to
the crust before you add the filling.
 
You can make this recipe with sugar for a great low fat
cheese cake.  For cheese cake with sugar or with a
non-scorching sugar substitute bake at 350 for 45 minutes.
 
You can make the recipe NO FAT by substituting 1/3 c.

applesauce for the butter in the crust and using fat free
cream cheese and yogurt.
 
For quick preparation and clean up.  Melt the butter in the
measuring cup you will use to press the crust into the pan.
Mix all the crust ingredients in the pie pan.  Prepare the
filling in your blender: add the eggs first then the
yogurt, cheese, and sweetener in that order.  Blend on high
for about 30 seconds then stop, scrape the sides, and
resume blending until smooth.  It takes less than 10
minutes to prepare(including the crust) and all you dirty
is your blender, a rubber spatula, and a measuring cup.
 
Fructose crystals can be found in the diabetic section of
most grocery stores, they are not usually with the sugar
substitutes.

This sounds intriguing, but 2 cups of soy sauce seems like
a rather large amount relative to the quantity of chicken.  
Is that the correct measure?  If so, the sodium content per
serving would be pretty high.

xxxx sugar means extra fine or powdered sugar, like 4 times the fineness of
regular granulated sugar.  It does not imply anything one might think about
if one was also thinking of film ratings.

  Beer Cheese Bread
  
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
   Ingredients:
   2 tablespoons sugar
   1 package dry yeast
   1/2 cup warm beer (105-115 degrees)
   2 1/2 cups bread flour, divided
   1 cup (4 ounces) shredded extra-sharp Cheddar cheese
   1/3 cup instant nonfat dry milk powder
   3/4 teaspoon dry mustard
   1/4 teaspoon ground red pepper
   1 egg, beaten
   vegetable cooking spray
   1 egg white, lightly beaten
   1 teaspoon sesame seeds, toasted
     _________________________________________________________________
                                      
   Dissolve sugar and yeast in warm beer in a large bowl; let stand 5
   minutes. Stir in 2/14 cups flour and next 6 ingredients to form a soft
   dough.
   
   Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead until smooth and
   elastic (about 8 minutes); add enough of remaining flour, 1 tablespoon
   at a time, to prevent dough from sticking to hands.
   
   Divide dough in half, and shape each portion into a 6-inch round loaf.
   Place loaves 4 inches apart on a large baking sheet coated with
   cooking spray. Brush tops of dough with egg white, and sprinkle with
   sesame seeds. Make 1/8-inch deep cuts in a lattice design across tops
   of loaves. Let rise in a warm place (85 degrees), free from drafts, 1
   hour and 15 minutes or until doubled in bulk. Bake at 375 degrees for
   15 minutes or until loaves sound hollow when tapped. Cool on wire
   racks. Yield: 2 loaves, 8 servings each.

This recipe is for one of my most favorite desserts--it is
very easy to make, and is absolutely scrumptious.  It comes
from one of my old cookbooks (which I picked up at a
garage sale!) called "Atlanta Cooks For Company".  
 
"Fudge Fantasy Pie"
 
1/2 Cup Butter, Melted
3 1-Ounce Squares Unsweetened Chocolate           
4 Eggs, Well-Beaten          
3 Tablespoons Light Corn Syrup
1 1/2 Cups Sugar, Granulated
1/4 Teaspoon Salt
1 Teaspoon Vanilla Extract

1 9-inch Unbaked pastry Shell
 
1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Prepare pastry shell.
2.  In top of double boiler melt butter and chocolate
together. (NOTE:  Use the real ingredients here--it's worth
it!)
3.  Beat eggs until light.  Blend in syrup, sugar, salt and
vanilla extract with the well-beaten eggs.
4.  Add the cholate mixture, slight cooled, to the egg
mixture.  Blend thoroughly and pour into an unbaked 9-inch
pastry shell.
5.  Bake at 350 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes until the top
is crusty.  The filling should remain somewhat soft inside.
(NOTE:  The pie should shake like a custard as it thickens
when cooled.  Do NOT overbake).
 
Try this recipe and let me know what you think!

Banana Bread
 
1 stick butter                          1 cup chopped nuts (I use pecans)
1 cup bananas                           1 cup sugar
1 teaspoon baking powder                1 1/2 cups flour
1 teaspoon almond extract               1 teaspoon baking soda
1 egg, well-beaten
 
Cream butter and sugar together.  Mix dry ingredients.  Mix beaten egg with
mashed banana.  Add dry ingredients alternately with egg/banana mixture to
creamed butter/sugar, beating well after each addition.  Beat in almond
extract and nuts.  Pour into well greased loaf pan and bake in 350 degree
oven of one hour.
 
This is my very favorite banana bread recipe (after trying many).  I
changed the original ingredient of vanilla extract to almond extract as I
loved the hint of flavor it added to the bread.

Artichoke and Ham Lasagna
 
1 can artichoke hearts                      2 tablespoons oregano
1/4 pound deli ham                          1 tablespoon basil
1/4 cup diced onions (sauteed)              1 cup low fat cottage cheese
2 small or 1 large can tomato sauce         pinch of garlic salt
mozzorella cheese (to suit)                 parmasean cheese (to suit)
lasagna noodles (cooked)
 
In a bowl mix together cottage cheese, basil, oregano, and salt.  Cook
onions till clear.  Mix onions with tomato sauce. Slice ham into strips.
Drain and slice artichoke hearts.  In a lasagna pan layer lasagna noodles,
cottage cheese mixture, tomato sauce mixture, ham, artichoke, and cheeses.
Repeat for desired layers.
 
Cook in a 300 degree oven for 30 minutes.  This is for a small lasagna.
 
This one is out of my head (cooking with what ingredients I had on hand).  
It worked and I have made it often since then.

Crock Pot Pizza
 
1 lb    italian sausage
1 lb    hamburger
1 jar (small)   pizza sauce (I use the kind that has pepperoni in it)
1 jar (regular size)    spaghetti sauce
1 1lb box of noodles of your choice (I used rotini and they worked really
                                     well)
1 3C bag shredded cheddar cheese
1 3C bag mozzarella cheese
 
Brown the sausage and hamburger together and drain.  Boil noodles almost to
doneness.
 
Put noodles and meat mixture in crock pot with both sauces.  Just about 20
minutes before serving, add both cheeses.  Takes about 20-30 minutes for
everything to "meld" together.
 
You can also add any other pizza toppings you like to spice up the recipe.

Received this today from an old friend whose Mom used to bake us treats at
my last job.  Sounds easy and good so I thought I would share it.
 
Chocolate Pizza
 
8 oz White Chocolate, divided
8 oz Chocolate Chips
1/2 cup each of the following:
  pecans
  mini-marshmallows
  Rice Krispies
  Red candied cherries
  Green candied cherries
 
In a heavy sauce pan on top of a double boiler, melt 6 ozs of white
chocolate and all of the chocolate chips.  Then stir in pecans,
marshmallows, and rice krispies.
 
Pour into a greased 10" pizza pan.  Put the cherries on top.  Melt
remaining white chocolate and drizzle over pizza.  Chill
 
Use your imagination for other items to top it with.

I actually got this recipe from Mr. Food from our local TV station.
 
1 can french bread dough (like pop-n-fresh)
1 12oz. bag mozzarella cheese (I used the pizza mix with provolone and moz)
 
Unroll the bread dough and sprinkle the chees over all.  Re-roll the bread
dough into a tube with the cheese inside.  Bake according to directions on
bread container.
 
Serve warm with marinara sauce.
 
So easy and quick!

I think you could make either individual pastry tarts or make a regular
size pie and cut it into servings.  Either way I think would look elegant.

well ursula,
 
bufallo wings, jalopeno poppers, fried cheese sticks, nachos (various
constructions), fried mushrooms, fried veggie basket(mixture of
califlower,zucchinni,onion rings and so on) stuffed baked potatoes, fried
chicken strips.
 
That's what the appetizers consist of. I didn't think of stuffed
mushrooms, kabob and something else you mentioned. Those are great ideas,
ursula. Can you give a brief description on how you like them prepared. All
info is considered.
 
The bar & grill is located in front of the University Football Stadium and
Special Events Center. Tons of people flock to the games and concerts.
We've had U2, Pink Floyd and Rolling Stones play at the football stadium.

Ribbon Jello
 
6 3 oz boxes of jello all different flavors
    (the flavors that taste best are the common ones like cherry, lemon,
     orange, etc.  Looks best with the colors of the rainbow)
24 oz sour cream
 
 
In a small bowl, combine 1 box of Jello and 1 cup bowling water.  Mix
thouroughly, then take one half of the mixture and add 3 Tbsp of cold
water.  Pour this into a 9 x 13 glass dish or several small individual
glass dishes.  Set in refrigerator for about 20 minutes.
 
Take the other half of the mixture and add 1/3 cup sour cream.  Add jello
to sour cream for smoother consistency.  Slowly pour this over first layer.
Put in refrigerator for 20 minutes.
 
Repeat above steps with each flavor of Jello.  Recipe takes approximately 4
hours to complete.  Must be done all at once to make layers of jello
slightly adhere to each other.  Keep refrigerated.

Brown Sugar Shortbread Cookies                Note 53 - 2 responses
 
6/10/98    10:05 am MST    susan tiss / novanet
 
Here is a very easy recipe for some 'melt in your mouth' cookies.
 
BROWN SUGAR SHORTBREAD COOKIES
 
1 cup (2 sticks) real butter (substituting w/ margarine is not recommended)
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 3/4 cups flour  
1/4 cup cornstarch  
 
Cream together butter and brown sugar until completely blended.
Sift together flour and cornstarch and add to the butter/sugar mixture.
Continue to mix until thoroughly blended.
Form dough in a log (or several short logs) about 3 inches in diameter,

wrap in wax paper and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. You can also freeze
the dough for later use.
 
Pre-heat oven to 275 (if you plan to cut your cookies thin than lower the
temp. to 225).
 
Remove dough from the refrigerator. Using a very sharp knife, cut cookies
from log: 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick works best (personally I prefer them on the
thick side of 1/2 inch).
 
Place on baking sheet (you can put them fairly close together as they don't
spread out much) and bake for 15 - 20 min. or until they are a light golden
color and firm in the center.  
 
Remove from sheet and allow to cool.
 
**because these cookies have such a high butter content, greasing the
cookie sheet is unnecessary.
 
Eat and ENJOY.  These cookie are an EXCELLENT companion to tea, coffee, or
milk.

Risotto - Italian rice dish                     Note 55 - 1 response
 
6/12/98    3:53 pm CDT    peter enstrom / novanet
 
Here is a traditional Italian dish that has become popular in the last few
years.  My family has always made it after holidays when we had leftover
turkey.
 
This is my grandmother's Risotto recipe.
 
2 Tbl. Oil
1 Medium onion (chopped)
1 Cup celery (chopped)
1 clove garlic (chopped or crushed)
2 Cups tomatoes (crushed or pureed) or tomatoe juice
Any left over gravy
2 Cups or so of left over turkey meat (shredded)
4 Cups (at least) of boiling water or broth
2 Cups Rice
 
In a large pan:  Saute the onions and celery.  Add the garlic and the 
meat and saute a little longer.  Add the tomatoes and gravy and simmer
over low heat for 20 minutes.  Add all of the rice and some of the hot
broth.  Stir and slowly add more hot broth as the rice absorbs the
moisture.  When it is done, the rice is tender and very sticky.
 
That is the recipe as it is written down.  I have written a lot more
notes from when I explained it to a friend who wanted to make it.
 
Before making Risotto: After all of the meat has been carved from a
turkey carcus, put the carcus into a large pot with all of the scraps that 
you aren't going to use.  Fill the pot with water and boil the carcus for
at least an hour - up to a couple of hours.  Turn off the heat and let it
cool down for a while.  Strain and refrigerate the broth.  Let the meat and
bones cool down some more.  Pick through the bones for meat scraps.  Shred
them into a bowl and discard the bones, catelige, skin and other gunk
(kind of a nasty job but someone has to do it :-)  At some point the bits
of meat that are left are so small that they aren't worth the effort.
Save as much of the gravy as you can (hide it from people who are snacking
on left overs!)  You can make Risotto without gravy but it isn't nearly as
rich.
 
I use olive oil but corn oil should be fine.  Saute the onions and celery
until the onions start to turn translucent.  They will cook more later so
it doesn't matter if they are not quite done.  You can use more garlic

than the recipe calls for (I do) 1 clove isn't very noticable 2-3 is fine.
I usually throw canned whole tomatoes into a blender and use them.  Be
careful sauteing the meat and garlic.  It is easy to burn it.  Turn the
heat way down to let it simmer.  You should get another pan and start the
broth boiling at this point.  If you don't think you have enough broth,
throw some extra water in.  After you add the rice you should start 
turning the heat up a bit to speed things up.  Be careful, the hotter the
flame, the more likely it is that hot, sticky risotto will be spit at you!
The water will start to be absorbed by the rice, add hot broth, a ladle or
2 at a time as the water dissapears.  If it looks like you are running low
on hot broth, throw a mug full of water into the microwave, repeat as
needed.  The rice is crunchy until it is done.  Once it is no longer
crunchy, it will still absorb a bit more water (maybe a mug full).  From
the time the rice was added, it takes about 20 minutes of stirring until 
the risotto is done.  It is good to have someone else around to take 
over the stirring as you get tired.

notice that my spring form pan is a 10inch one rather than an 8inch one so
the cheesecake turned out a little shorter than usual.  It still tasted

0-19    The Chocoholic Wanna-be You have a dysfunctional relationship with
chocolate and are taking this test because you have no life.  
 
20-39   The Chocolate Tease  You merely flirt with chocolate, noticing the
glaringly empty places in your life while finding yourself unable to commit
to chocolate alone.  You probably buy vanilla ice cream and put fruit on
it.
 
40-59   The Chocoholic Enabler  You undoubtedly live with someone committed
to chocolate, and you understand and support its power.  However, you
prefer coffe to hot cocoa.
 
60-79   The Chocolate Enthusiast  You have a fairly healthy relationship
with chocolate, enjoying it when it's available without missing it when
it's not.  You lack a deep commitment.  
 
80-99   The Manic Chocoholic You struggle with strong chocolatic swings in
your life.  You are committed to the stuff, but you find yourself binging
for a week or two, then going into denial about your real needs and
desires.
 
100-119 The Chocolate Fanatic You know what you want and how to get it.  
You have a deep-seated commitment to chocolate, and you are admired by
those around you.  You probably watch the commodities index and buy bulk
cocoa beans low.
 
120     The Quintessential Chocoholic You exemplify chocolate.  You have a
code, and you live by it.  You do not attend fuctions where chocolate is
unwelcome, and you share chocolate with those you love.

Mudslide #4
 
Ingredients:
1 oz Absolut Vodka  
1 oz Bailey's irish cream  
1 oz Kahlua  
3/4 oz Grand marnier    
 
Mixing instructions:
Two methods of mixing: 1) straight up on the rocks - mix the 4 ingredients
and pour over ice. -- 2) Frozen - mix 4 ingredients in a blender, add ice
until frostly.
 
Creator/contributor's comments:
The frozen mudlside is great in the summer, came across this mix in St.
Martin several years ago. Tried the mix straight up later found it even
better. The addition of Grand Marnier adds a little something extra. At a
bar, they do not add Grand marnier, so ask for a B-52 with a shot of vodka.
==============================
 
Mudslide #5
 
Ingredients:
1 part Vodka  
1 part Bailey's irish cream  
1 part Chocolate liqueur (Godiva)

(lining the inside of the glass) and not mixed and served in a margarita

Ok folks - here's that yummy butter cookie recipe...
 
BROWN SUGAR SHORTBREAD COOKIES
 
1 cup (2 sticks) of butter softened (substituting margarine is not
recommended)
1/2 cup brown sugar
1 3/4 cups flour
1/4 cup cornstarch
 
 
Cream together butter and brown sugar until very well blended.
Sift together flour and cornstarch and add to the butter mixture.  
Continue to mix until thoroughly blended (the longer you blend this stuff
the better the cookies taste) .
 
Roll dough into a log about 3 inches in diameter, wrap in wax paper and
refrigerate for at least 1 hour.  (you can also freeze the dough for use
later - however, thaw the dough in the refrigerator for 1/2 to 1 hour
before cutting cookies or the dough will crumble as you try to cut it)
 
Pre-heat oven to 275 (if you plan to cut your cookies thin than lower the
temperature to 225).

Cut cookies from log:  1/4 to 1/2 inch thick works best.
 
Place on baking sheet and bake for 15 - 20 min. or until they are a light
golden brown and firm in the center.
Remove from sheet and allow to cool.
 
*because these cookies have such a high butter content, greasing the cookie
sheet is unnecessary.

Pumpkin Bread
 
INGREDIENTS:
2-1/2 cups sugar            3-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup vegetable oil         2 tsps baking soda

                            1/2 tsp cloves
 
*This recipe is tastiest when made w/ fresh pumkin rather than canned.  To
make pumpkin puree steam pumpkin meat untill tender all the way through and
then blend in a food processor or blender until it becomes a thick liquid.

also freeze the puree for later use.  
 
If you need to use canned pumpkin then use 1 1/3 cups pumpkin and 2/3 cups
water blended.
 
DIRECTIONS:
 
Sift dry ingredients at least twice if baking same day (or allow to stand
overnight).  Combine sugar, oil, and eggs and beat until fluffy. Add
pumpkin mixture alternately with sifted dry ingredients to batter.
 
Recipe will make the following:  3 dozen muffins; 2 - 9x5x3 loaf pans; 3
smaller size loaf pans (with a few muffins left over) 4 small foil loaf
pans; 1 tube pan.  Baking time will vary from 15 minutes for muffins; 35
minutes for small loaf pans; 45 minutes for larger loaf pans; 55 minutes

Powdered Sugar Ball Cookies (I think these are the same as or similar to
cookies sometimes called Mexican Wedding Cookies and/or Russian Tea
Cookies)
 
INGREDIENTS:
 
1 cup Butter - soft
1/2 cup Powdered Sugar - sifted
1 tsp Vanilla
2 1/4 cup Flour - sifted
1/4 tsp salt (I usually use a little less)
3/4 cup Pecans - finely chopped
 
 
DIRECTIONS:
 
Mix together butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla.  Add flour, salt, and
pecans.  Chill dough (should be well chilled - 1 or more hours is best).
Roll dough into 1 inch balls, place on ungreased cookie sheet.  Bake at 350
degrees until set but not brown (about 10 -15 min). Roll in powdered sugar
- cool and roll in powdered sugar again.
 
*the first layer of powdered sugar kinda melts into the hot cookies and
gives the second layer something to stick to*

When we camp with Girl Scouts we make a version of this called Hanky
Pankies.  Instead of the mozzarella cheese, we cut velveeta cheese into
chunks and melt it into the sausage.  We use pillsbury pizza dough instead
of the crescent rolls.
 
The girls just LOVE this dish.

the joy of eating is the famous italian food meal called egg plant
parmisian. one of the best. it is fried and then served on a nice fancy
plate and its sides can be spegetti and bread sticks and a bowl of salad.
and the drink could be the infamous brandy.

prefer. then, drain the excess water and add about a pinch of each spice
listed to the drained shrimp.(leave a little water in the shrimp for the
spices to simmer in). After that, slice up your pepperoni.
 
second, spread your pizza dough out into a round circle,
then spread the Gaston's pizza sauce over the dough (for added spice,
lightly base with Gaston's spicy garlic sauce, if preferred).
 
Then, you start to add your sauteed shrimp and spicy pepperoni on top of
the sauce in even porportions , and then top with basil, cortiliono, and
oregano spices for added robust flavor.   
 
Place inside oven in a lightly greased pan and bake for 30-45 minutes.

Get ready to have a tasty treat from England! First cut up some sponge cake
into a large bowl. Top that with some strawberry Jell-o Mix. Next, add
sliced fruit into the liquid Jell-O. Now place some Bird's custard on top
and set in the fridge to cool for about an hour. Add whip cream to the top
and enjoy!

of seasoning. Now you can apply the flour to the Meat(pork) so it will have

already, The dail should be on 5 or 5.5! let the pork cook for a good ten
mins, then you can flip it over to let the other side cook!, once it is
done...do what ever you want with it, eat it, throw it away I dont care, i

refried beans
You rinse out the beans you place them on a pot with eight cups of water.
Then you let them simmer on low for one hour and check them until they are
soft, if not cook them a little longer until they are ready and add some
salt almost at the end.  Once they are cooked you refried them.
First you get a pan and add two tablespoons of oil and heat it up, then you
add the beans to the pan and start smashing them until they are blended and
ready to serve.

first rinse out the beans you place them on the pot with 8 cup water
second then you let them simmer on low for one hour check them until they
are soft or not cook them littl longere. untile they read add little salt
almost at the end. once cooked refired them. first  you would need a pan
and add two talbespoons of oil and heat up
second then you add the beans to the pan and start smashing until are
blended and redy to serve

Jessica Estrada's Pineapple Cake    
 
get one box vanilla pudding
and get two containers of whipped cream
get 1 can of chopped up pineapples
and one box of cake mix (white cake mix or vanilla)
 
Directions!
First you grab a big bowl and you make the vanilla pudding and
place that in the bowl and then mix the 1 container of whipped cream in
there too thenyou put the one can of pineapples and mix it all together.So
then sfter that you make the cake any size or shape, you can make one layer
or two but I make the cake with layers but anyways put everything that is
in the bowl in top of the cake and just put it where ever but after you are
dine doing that then just put the cake in the frige until cold and then
enjoy!:)

First go to your local grocery store and grab a box of brownie mix. Any
kind will do as long as it calls for butter.
Then go home and follow the directions on the box. When it's time to add
the butter, put it into a sauce pan on medium heat. When it melts, you can
add anything special that will inhance your taste buds! (ex:
cherries, orange syrup, nuts, herbal remedies, or even more chocolate!)
Make sure the butter is melted completely. Leave on stove for a good 5
minutes after adding in the extra goodies. Then, simply add the butter into
the brownie mixture and continue following the directions on the box.
 
Don't forget to set the timer on the brownies! And also turning the oven
off when you are completely done!!!      
 
enjoy!

Vanilla Mallow Pie
2 cups of mini marshmallows
1 3/4 cup milk
Aprox. 3/4 cup of cool whip
1 box of vanilla pudding mix
1 (6-8 inch) graham pie crust
4-6 Bananas
 
Mix milk and pudding mix in a big bowl. Then add the marshmallows and cool
whip(if too thick add more cool whip, you dont want to add too much because
it will make the pudding runny and the pie wont set)
Stir well, let chill for about 5 mins. While waiting cut the bananas into
slices and line inside the pie crust with them (thickness of slices varies
with preference). Then pour chilled pudding into pie crust and let chill
for an hour or two, or until firm. Then enjoy! ^_ ^

Although these pancakes look and sound very appealing, these
pancakes don't seem very nutritous at all. However, I would like to try
them out for myself one day. :)

Honey & Spice Grilled Chicken
 
*Measurements call for 3 chicken breasts*
 
1 cup Honey *not sugar free!*
3 tbs Brown sugar
1 tbs soy sauce
2 tsp spicy mustard
1 tbs cayenne pepper
1 tsp chilli powder
3 tsp sea salt
 
Mix honey, brown sugar, soy sauce and spicy mustard in a boiling pan on low
heat. Stir constantly till mixture starts to bubble.    
 
Mix other ingredients in a ziplock bag with the 3 uncooked chicken breasts
and close the bag. Shake well and softly pound the seasoning till the
chicken has soaked it all up.
 
When the honey mixture starts to bubble take it off the heat. After cooking
the chicken breasts on 325 for 15 minutes take them out of the oven and
pour the mixture on top of the chicken. Place back in oven for 5-8 more

Mango Popsicles
2 Mangos
A package of popsicle sticks
3 cups of water
1 1/2 cups of powder mango
A package of cups (10-15cups)
Blend the mangos (peeled and sliced up) and water and powder
very well until thick and slimey.
Pour 3/4 of each cup with it and slide a popsicle stick right in the middle
of each one.
When all the cups are made put the cups in a nice flat spot in the freezer.
And let it freeze about a full 24 hours.
Just for touch ups the next day it's done you can add a squirt of "lemon"
and
a couple of pinches of "chile powder" and "Chamuy" to taste the real flavor
of a good mango popsicle!!
"Chile powder and Chamuy sold in any grocery store in the hispanic
sections"

Tiffany NeSmith
Red Velvet Cake
 
Vegetable oil for the pans
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cups sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon fine salt
1 teaspoon cocoa powder
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
1 cup buttermilk, at room temperature
2 large eggs, at room temperature
2 tablespoons red food coloring (1 ounce)
1 teaspoon white distilled vinegar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Cream Cheese Frosting, recipe follows
Crushed pecans, for garnish
Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil and flour 3 (9 by 1 1/2-inch
round) cake pans.
 
In a large bowl, sift together the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, and
cocoa powder. In another large bowl, whisk together the oil, buttermilk,
eggs, food coloring, vinegar, and vanilla.
Using a standing mixer, mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients
until just combined and a smooth batter is formed.
 
Divide the cake batter evenly among the prepared cake pans. Place the pans
in the oven evenly spaced apart. Bake, rotating the pans halfway through
the cooking, until the cake pulls away from the side of the pans, and a
toothpick inserted in the center of the cakes comes out clean, about 30
minutes.
 
Remove the cakes from the oven and run a knife around the edges to loosen
them from the sides of the pans. One at a time, invert the cakes onto a
plate and then re-invert them onto a cooling rack, rounded-sides up. Let
cool completely.
 
Frost the cake. Place 1 layer, rounded-side down, in the middle of a
rotating cake stand. Using a palette knife or offset spatula spread some of
the cream cheese frosting over the top of the cake. (Spread enough frosting
to make a 1/4 to 1/2-inch layer.) Carefully set another layer on top,
rounded-side down, and repeat. Top with the remaining layer and cover the
entire cake with the remaining frosting. Sprinkle the top with the pecans
 
Cream Cheese Frosting:
1 pound cream cheese, softened
4 cups sifted confectioners' sugar
2 sticks unsalted butter (1 cup), softened

File: recipes                    August 30, 2015                    Page: 214
 
 
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
In a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, or with a hand-held
electric mixer in a large bowl, mix the cream cheese, sugar, and butter on
low speed until incorporated. Increase the speed to high, and mix until
light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. (Occasionally turn the mixer off, and
scrape the down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula.)
 
Reduce the speed of the mixer to low. Add the vanilla, raise the speed to
high and mix briefly until fluffy (scrape down the bowl occasionally).
Store in the refrigerator until somewhat stiff, before using. May be stored
in the refrigerator for 3 days.
 
Yield: enough to frost a 3 layer (9-inch) cake
