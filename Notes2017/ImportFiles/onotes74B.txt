---------- note 0 SD rdraw
  03/29     10.45     friedman       csa

Apparent bug in SD generation of an rdraw:?
Entered  SD with code:
at       2539
write    Press xxx for a list
          of terms and keys
          active in this lesson.
Positioned cursor at 2539 and pressed shift+, then marked 5
-p-s counterclockwise to generate box around text. SD
display looked ok, but produced this code:
at        2539
rdraw    -101;199;222;176,16;-101
But the "199" is wrong (-8,-32 works); the 199 executes
(student mode) by drawing to a point way off to the left.?
By the way, all my cursor moves were in "g" mode; why
does rdraw generation sometimes produce fine-grid
coordinates? (They usually work; just curious.)

a minute after entering this note, you asked whether service
can produce -rdraw-s. ??????!!!!!!!!
if you meant specifically -SS- or lesson service, no i dont
think it can.
or if your question was about displaying -rdraw-s by service,
no, -rdraw- is not recognized by sd, id or ss.

First of all, thanks for the information -- I will look
into the problem.

Second, how do you generate, in coarse grid, a point which
is UP and to the RIGHT of the origin...or DOWN and to the
LEFT? Positive coarse-grid coords go down and to the
RIGHT, negative go up and to the LEFT...
After I wrote the thing, I was sorry that it didnt always
generate fine grid...this is too confusing..

this error is repeatable --- when searching datafile
"mtcdata" for say a specfic area command.

the front page reads 28 of 27 blocks which might cause
part of the problem

---------- response 3
  04/01     12.27     white       p

thanks. The "28 out of 27" bug is on our lists. And
yes, that is probably what is causing the block number
to be Out Of Range (OOR).

---------- note 7 data probs
  03/29     14.15     obrien       uicc

DataFile "uiccdata" has 13 of 13 blocks, but only about
4 pages worth of data. Better look at the file directory,
and then check things out. We use no -outputl-'s, just
garden-variety -output-s.

Later: error only occurs on an unrestricted search. If
we look only for -area- info, we see all the areas that
would likely be in a full datafile.

---------- response 1
  03/29     14.51     judy       pso

I was looking through this file in INSPECT ONLY to see if
I could isolate anything further:

Sequence:
1) select data type--choice ¬$5
2) choose data type "output" only
3) look at file and see the output stuff
4) select data type, choice ¬$5 again
5) set it to show "all" data types
6) select choose certain students--choice ¬$1
   When I get to the choose student(s) page, the 1st
   two positions of the list have
   1 bcanumber cor
   2 rect
If I then go back to the main data page the "selected
students" thing still says ALL.

Can be reproduced in this file. I tried it in another
datafile and got only normal expected results.

---------- note 12 at 101??
  03/29     22.47     judy       pso

Lesson "helper", block "test"

  The writing done by the -writec- is sometimes at the
proper address, and sometimes started at 101. I can't
see any rhyme or reason to it except that it IS the same
each time.

You have gotten wild with your presses of access.
Retype any line before one that goes to the upper
left with ONE (not two, or even four as you have now)
access code. (Using micro comma, rather than access
comma should allow you to press micro as often as you
want, but only put in one access code.)

---------- response 2
  03/30     09.49     judy       pso

This is a bunch of code lifted from somebody's lesson.

I've had similar problems brought to me before and never
know what to do except punt......
How did you decide there were extra accesses? By changing
to common?

---------- response 3
  04/01     12.29     white       p

changing to common verified what I suspected after
I retyped a line ending in ¬, and the next tag
was suddenly displayed in the correct place.
---------- note 13 out error
  03/29     23.55     david       hebrew

Got an -oUT- error tonite at 23:55
david hebrew 12.
Just before I got it, I garbaged up my lesson change
code and backed out very very fast. A colleague
now looking at the site display says I am the only
guy who has a course name listed (I signed in again to
make this note). Further: We hung momentarily about
1/2 hour before this note. The hang (3 sec or so)
erased my screen and, when I recovered, had garbaged up
a couple of bytes of the line I was last editing.
Hope this helps.

The current (3/30) student mode to author mode display
(w/ wds of common, etc) stinks. There is no need to get
the words of common etc each time we shift-stop. I thought
this place was obssesed with fast system displays. Put
the new info on a keypress, pleeeeeeeeez. TL

---------- response 1
  03/30     13.48     john r       r1

The new breakdown of info is useful, but I agree. Does
that page really need anything more than the CPU time
(which seems to be the most critical variable in a lesson)
and a "Press SHIFT-HELP for options"?

---------- response 2
  03/30     16.50     warner       tutoring

Well, maybe CPU time and total length only, plus, say...
-NEXT-  to edit
-DATA-  to retry
-LAB-    for "AUTHOR MODE"
-BACK-  for "STUDENT MODE"
-DATA1- for variables.
-HELP1- for more information.

---------- response 3

      I agree with john risken. There should be less text
on that page, not more!

  03/30     19.08     frye       css

Hey, wait!

I _like_ the change to the "STOP1" page.......it tells some
things about the lesson that you might not know by just
being in it.

Why is it that every time there is some minor change in
the way a certain system page looks, or acts, there is
wholehearted disapproval of the alteration, and heated
demands for something different?

I think that most of the recent changes (i.e. above, the
editor, "STUDENT MODE",etc.) are certainly not totally
different from their older versions, and I know that some
of them have been made to insure greater accessibility in
the future when there is even more of a "crunch" on the
system...........so why not just adjust to change, instead
of being "hooked" on the past............sheeeeeeeeeessssh!

by the way, thanks for the change to condensing!

---------- response 6
  03/30     19.49     berger       css

I agree with frye. That information _is_ useful to
some of us, and is little bother to the rest. Please
leabe it in. Thanks for the trouble you went to,

  03/30     20.49     blomme       s
    Comments:
(1) You are NEVER going to be able to just "skip" through
that page, because some of the output includes a slide
command to be sure no slide is selected--so forget any
ideas you have of less text meaning faster skipping past.
(It is really not intended to be skipped through anyway.)

(2) The previous "total" shown was a sum of common and
lesson lengths, but did not include storage. Thus:
(a) your total ecs usage was not properly reflected and
(b) you could not tell (from this display) whether your
lesson was approaching 8000 words if you also had common.

(3) It should be a simple matter now that we are getting
and showing the proper information to make the breakdown
display conditional upon the fact that there is actually
a breakdown to show.

(4) Goodness gracious!

---------- response 8
  03/30     22.22     john r       r1

Nobody who has to worry about things like ECS doubts the
value of the new info. I thought I was suggesting that it
simply didn't need to be unconditionally shown. Thanks
indeed to those who made the new info available.

---------- response 9
  03/31     13.15     layman       matha

I agree w/ risken + esp blomme's 3rd comment. After a
thorough indoctrination in speedy displays (signon, editor
stuff), it was a bit disconcerting to have to see info
that wasnt neccessary.(eg 0 wds common). Any info the system
can provide is great, provided its not nil information or
is available by choice ( variables etc). TL

Another chapter in the continuing story of PLATO's
adventures:

At around 2:15 CDT, Mike Walker and myself jumped out
of our seats at the sound of an alarm from the computer
room. We dashed in and started to make preparations for
the system to shut down, but before we knew it, the power
went off. After looking at the control panel and the water
chilling equipment, we diagnosed the problem as a water
chiller failure and proceeded to contact the proper
authorities. The refrigeration man arrived shortly after
3 0'clock, and had the machinery fixed by around 3:45.
We called our CDC computer engineer, Larry Crotser,
who soon came in and turned on the computer.

Our ever-ready operator, Morris Toporek, and myself. pro-
ceeded to bring up the system at 4:20, and PLATO was up
by 4:30.

Thank you! That is a lot of what we needed to know.
One question, however: if we need to know that while
the computer is down, is there a phone number that
maximizes the strategy for getting an answer on weekends?

---------- note 35 Waste????
  03/30     21.40     alam       ames

    Why not allow the 6ˆtˆh argument of a -search- to
be a segmented var - thus saving gobs and gobs of space
for the 7 argument -search- !!!

eg.
search 'a',1,nc645,jcount,1,nc700,150

The above code wastes 150-¬$a's variables! (bad show!)

VS

define segment,seg=nc700,10
search 'a',1,nc645,jcount,1,seg(1),150

¬W¬W¬W Uses only 25 actual variables max! (much better!)

FEED-BACK------FROM SYS---FROM ANYONE----??????????????

---------- response 1
  03/30     22.19     blomme       s

  The search command is optimized for speed and is
very very much faster than a simple character compare
loop. Every machine register is used in this routine to
hold some counter, mask, or other; an attempt to use
segmented variables would have the effect of slowing the
whole thing down by probably a factor of 2 due to the
special checks that would need to be made and the additional
masks and info that would have to be saved somewhere. If
using segmented variables had been simple and seemed at all
feasible, rest assured that the modifications would have
been made many months ago.

 Thanks, John.?
I'm quite sure that the lesson is useful (at least in
principle). However, your note about it isn't. I didn't
know what to look for in the lesson, and I'm sure many
people didn't look for that reason. You should perhaps
announce that you have a character to line convertor.?

Term talk still is freaky if you are in a lesson that has

  04/01     12.05     celia       pso

I would like to see a change in the display that you see
after signing on and before pressing STOP1. The message
is something to the effect that you should press STOP1
again when you leave. This info is FALSE!!! if you are
in author mode. Of course, old authors know that to do,
and they never read it anyway. But new authors read it,
and it tells them lies.

---------- response 1
  04/01     16.04     rader       s

What lies, Celia? I can get out by pressing -STOP1-...
several times--is that your complaint?

---------- response 2
  04/01     17.27     celia       pso

Yes, I guess that is it. It really is a message intended
for students, and when new authors read it, they still
need more information, to wit: press STOP1 several times,
or press BACK several times, or press a succession of
BACK's and STOP1's.

Is it possible at that point in the sign on process to
differentiate students from authors, and write something
appropriate to each, or to reword the message?

Two seconds thought tells me that it isn't possible to
distinguish students from authors at that point. So
I guess my question is "Could the message be reworded
somehow?" I don't have a suggestion at the moment, but
I'll try to think of something.

---------- response 3
  04/03     10.01     rader       s

What we hope to do is make -STOP1- have an appropriate
effect throughout system lessons--typically, to have the
same effect as -BACK-. If a new author presses -STOP1-
and does not get off--but does get back to where he can
get off--is that too confusing? The worst is pressing
-STOP1- and getting no result!

---------- note 61 CR¬D101
  04/01     12.12     judy       pso

Suppose I type "a, shift-square, shift-CR, a, b" at an arrow
In the response buffer I get: 001 76 71 01 02 0000000000.

This gives me "a" at the arrow, and then CR to the upper
left-hand corner, then "¬ab" appearing at 101.

In other words the access is serving two functions:
  a) part of code for return to upper left
  b) part of code to make the ¬a

Is this intentional? It would seem more logical to ask
for 001 76 71 76 01 02 00000000 to make the results
described. ¬ˆ¬W

You're right, Judy, it shouldn't. Tell somebody to look

             more than 1 thing after you enter your
             password,either a feature for such after
             the password is entered,or such a feature
             obtainable from author mode.

          2. Something comparable to the -OUT- command
             of the editor for the directory page,to
             prevent major mistakz from being transfered
             to disk,without
                     a) being in the editor,or
                     b) replacing with back-up

If either of these are present or in the works,sorry.
Also,what ever happened to the idea of inter-author
mailboxes???????

(2) huh? If you mean the index display in editing, at that
point it is too late--when you are on that display any
changes made to a block have been returned to the disk
(this policy almost certainly will be kept in effect to
guarantee that the latest changes are indeed resident
on the disk and not subject to loss). If you mean
some-thing/place else, what?

1) The idea was discussed in old notes, and in general
   rejected by systems, because very few authors felt it
   necessary to change more than one at a time.
   J. Risken, more recently, brought up the idea of
   changing talk flags without signing out.
3) The change is considered involved but possible
   in the far future.

Two things: all night tonight, we have been getting
knocked out of student mode when the site says that
we have 135000 ecs and are using 25000! We realize
that you are having problems with the ecs and air-
conditioning so maybe you are running on half or
one-fourth actual ecs. Though you might like to know.
Secondly, since we had all of these problems with
execution, when pressing STOP1 from edit and there
isnt enough space, the message Not enough room
try partial condense, press 'p' at the block page.
That should be updated to 'P'.

Two things:

1) I think it is a little bit unfair to be forced to wait
   45 seconds to condense when in 5 or 10 seconds you can
   be deleted, as is the case tonite. I realize that there
   are problems with ECS, but _noone_ was able to condense
   anything.

2) When a lesson is deleted and the person in it goes to
   the "Press NEXT to edit this lesson" page, the finish
   unit of that lesson is joined, as expected. However,
   when one is taken to the "Lesson Deleted" page, the
   finish unit is NOT joined. What gives?

1) If you think that is exasperating, try taking a photo

   The "lesson deleted" page appeared so fast that we had
   to manually disconnect the terminal in order to get it
   to hold the page long enough to photograph.
2) That always happens, blast it. The deleting routine
   sends some STOP1 keypresses to the various terminals
   in the lesson before it is deleted. That takes most
   people through the finish unit. But lately, for some
   reason, the procedure that presses STOP1 has failed,
   and the whole lesson yanked out of ECS so that there
   is no finish unit to execute. Can some systems person
   fix this? PUH-LEASE? Pretty please, with a carton of
   chocolate chip?

Dal, you can always condense a lesson, even if it is
temporarily unavailable (at least you used to.) It is only
from the STUDENT MODE page that that unavailable message
appears. This was always the case when I was testing
empire from author mode.
Do you think perhaps you are getting the _fake_

Regarding note ¬$61, it would seem to be possible to put
the "Press SHIFT-STOP" page after the "Type course" page
rather than before it, and therefore be able to distinguish
authors from students in time to give an appropriate "when
you leave" message. I assume that it would still be
possible to skip the page had STOP1 been pressed after
either "Type name" or "Type course". --jim wilson

---------- response 1

  Currently, of course, knowledgeable authors press the
STOP1 key after typing their name in order to AVOID seeing
the message regarding STOP1--I would anticipate a deluge
of objections were they to be required to go through
an additional "information" display telling them how to
get off the system!!!
  I do believe that we should try to make STOP1 actually
the sign-off key in more places--note that it DOES in
fact sign you off if you press it (rather than BACK) on
the STUDENT MODE display. The other places I have in mind
are the AUTHOR MODE display and the "end-of-lesson" display
that an author sees upon pressing STOP1 when in a lesson.

As my note stated, it would still be possible for
experienced authors to skip any instructions there might
be. Although I agree that it would be best to avoid any
place where a succession of -STOP1S would not get an
author out, it would seem that there will always be places
from which at least two -STOP1-s are required, which
is, as celia pointed out, confusing to new authors.

Moving the "Press SHIFT-STOP" page could certainly be
done with no effects noticeable to "knowledgeable" authors,
although, admittedly, there might be minor temporary con-
fusion among students who see the pages in a different
order.

--jim wilson
---------- response 5
  04/03     18.50     jhw       speech

The place most essential for -STOP1- to be activated is the
"Type course" page.

For Mr. Rader, other places include virtually all sys
lessons: micro ¬+ charset editors, records (besides already
active main display), data inspection, site display,
editor ID, "type password" page, etc. It would seem
that quite a few changes or a general one with a number
of exceptions need to be made before even a succession
of -STOP1-s will work. --jim wilson

---------- note 99 delimiter
  04/02     18.57     layman       matha

How about a universal delimiter for use in write
statements? If anyone needs a write with blanks trailing
on the right, a special comment must be made to warn anyone
who might replace the line that blank chars are to be
written (which takes up a line). If a delimiter (say, ¬,)
was found by the condenser, blanks to the left of it would
remain (which doesnt happen when you have a -$$-).
However, the -, symbol would be thrown away by the condenser
and not be written. Also this would clearly mark where
trailing right blanks are for better editing.

1 second for key-echoing (as opposed to our normal response

run about a dozen terminals using the ARPANET...since then
they will not have to pay long-distance telephone costs.

Unfortunately it is not some sort of joke. This is not

response time for various reasons. The weird thing is
that we seem always to be on the defensive, trying to
justify our emphasis on responsiveness, while much of the
world assures us that a one- to several-second delay
does not matter.....

I agree strongly with Carter: _all_ lessons would be
affected unacceptably (to us).

But to throw in another pointed example, I imagine editing
must be unpleasant, considering how most of us work.
And imagine the "steering" problems when moving the ID

I am sorry that some persons feel that they are on the
defensive. I really don't see how anything that Paul
said in his introductory note was a threat to anyone.
Nobody claims that 1 second or more delays are desireable.
In fact I quoted that statistic as a current value,
not the end goal. In fact typical ARPANET delays are
on the order of .1 to .5 sec and are usually introduced
by the host computers and not the network itself.
We haven't yet achieved these values for this connection
and are investigating the reasons why.
   However, in my current usage of PLATO I have come
across few places where a delay as bad as 1 sec seems
to make much difference one way or another. It is
usually a matter of personal taste (except for the
games mentioned)...but please dont feel threatened!

As someone who is using the net currently i can say that
the erratic delays in echoing are a nuisance when typing
but not fatal for TTY type things. To reduce this problem
the net lets one request the TIP(terminal interface
processor)do local echoing of chars which is of the <1/10
second delay variety, but the net and its computers were
not designed to allow representative echoing or even
cursoring operations which require the host computer to
look at each key(most systems on the net would go into
cardiac arrest trying to keep up with plato). When it
comes to that kind of activity you are using the best that
is available.
What we would like to see would be a PLATO/net interface
that would let a tutor program "talk" to a net host and
pass data to and receive responses from computers on the
net. In this way each computer could do what it does
best. (continued)

---------- response 8
  04/04     18.58     emg       mtcc

PLATO could be used to rapidly process "easy" responses,
and a net computer could be used to process more complex
responses. There are many things in the artificial
intelligence and simulation area which simply cannot be
handled in 10ms/sec and a few thousand words of core, but
these things will run acceptably fast in a system such as a
PDP 10 when it is configured with several hundred thousand
words of core and a fast drum. In this mode the net would
not be required to echo but would transmit bursts of chars
which it does well.
Would anyone at CERL like to perform this kind of interface
and thus provide PLATO users with access to the net?
It might make for some very interesting kinds of instruction
without consuming much PLATO cpu time as many of the current
interesting lessons do. I suspect that people at ARPA
would gleam with delight if this were done.

May I suggest that authors consider putting in a catch
for unanswered "arrows" where the student presses -NEXT-.
In many cases a wrong counter is incremented when the
student presses -NEXT- without answering the question.
This penalizes many students who accidentally press
-NEXT-.
This problem can be solved by:
exact
judge ignore
     you may add......exact
                      write¬oat,x¬1"Please try an answer."
                      pause
                      at x
                      erase ("please try an answer")

How about a specs option to ignore all blank responses?
Pouting in those 2 lines of code (don't I know them well)
isnt hard but a system-implemented blank ans skipper might
be more efficient.

I too am one of those who puts "join blank" after
every arrow, where unit blank contains
  exact
  judge ignore

Another thing I often put in that unit, just before the
-exact- command, is "jkey help", so that pressing HELP
gets the student thru to the hint I provide on unrecognized
responses (after the last -no- command).

Maybe we need an -iarrow- similar to -imain-?

  04/03     09.23     errol       kk1

May I suggest that authors who use "long 1" consider
that terminals far away from Urbana may have slight
line problems and that although a student might press
the appropriate key, another number is registered and
he is jumped somewhere he did not intend to be or
is judged incorrectly. "long 2" ensuring that -NEXT-
is pressed would be better in most cases.
Also, the student will be able to change his keypress.

---------- response 1
  04/03     13.58     warner       tutoring

Also, authors should try to avoid long-1 arrows
where the answer may be zero. This is because most
keypresses which are degraded by long-line problems
come out zeroes, and occasional phone-line glitches
may introduce extra zeroes into a student's responses.
The best tactic is to judge ignore any answer which is
zero at arrows with a -long 1-.

Another approach might be to design a modem which is more
reliable. Not only would it avoid the problem mentioned
but it would reduce the number of long distance keypresses
coming into the system; i.e.
"telewhone" requires keys
erase erase erase erase erase p h o n e
to remove a one key error if you are not a touch typist
looking at the screen constantly.

0/0 is an "undefined" expression and any direct comparison
is arbitrarily processed just to avoid giving students
execution error messages. If you want to do exact
comparisons, you may use the fact that 0/0 (and 1/0,-0/0,
-1/0) has a unique octal code. (you may determine these
by writing a series of appropriate calcs and looking at
what results-most "desk calculators" unfortunately will
not let you see these codes properly. Note that each
of these "undefined" expressions has a unique octal code)

It is not _quite_ arbitrary! When you ask, is 5 = 0/0,
the answer might as well be "yes", since 0/0 being
indefinite means that it can mean _any_ value, including 5.

I have a page in certain cs lessons which lists a table of
available terms, calling that key TERM; at the bottom of the
table is the note: "Hold down SHIFT when you press TERM".?
But in general, I have not seen confusion from the
terminology "SHIFT-TERM"; I also have many cs lessons which
use that "barbarism" in a table of available terms, and it
seems to get across to the student properly.?
After all, our basic objective is to get something across
to a student. It seems immaterial to me what the "proper"
PLATOese should be, unless we happen to be teaching about
PLATO itself. Why should the student care what the
"proper" name for that *:$!* key is?

re: TERM1

it seems to me the contingent insisting that SHIFT/TERM is
incorrect has two strikes against it:

1. There's a difference between telling someone to "Press
   the asterisk key." and telling someone to "Write an
   asterisk on the screen." In the 2nd case, people will
   naturally hit shifted eight. In the first case, tho,
   i would bet that a huge percentage (if not a majority)
   would be likely to simply press the key with an
   asterisk marked on it!

       It seems to me that the situation with TERM is
       very like the first case above. People are
       simply following instructions and pressing the
       key that says "term" since they have NOT been
       specifically instructed to write term on the
       screen.

2. Maintaining that people should realize TERM is
   a shifted key just because it is written above
   the word ANS is actually _inconsistent_ with some
   other PLATO conventions!

   I am referring specifically to the arrow keys which
   students (and authors) are told to press with the
   expectation that they will NOT be shifted. And i
   don't think most beginning students or authors can
   appreciate the fact that in this case it is OK
   because alternate keyset (font).

a well taken point but:
i can see the great usage of the cursor while editing
to test for screen location.
one other good use will be at execution time for the
student to specify screen location few examples:
1) point at a functional portion of a molecule in a chem
   test.
2) specify a screen location, ie. wherex,wherey have to be
   updated with the cursor. (they probably will be anyhow
   because it will be last screen activity).
i can state many more but i think the point is clear.
if someone comes and say this is difficult to do, i give up
but if not why not add it?!

        2. A system variable indicating whether the step

           step command which would step through that many

You may be interested to know that (as I understand it)
essentially all our miseries of the last few days are
due to the cooling failure Saturday (and air-conditioning
failure today). The computer turns itself off when
the temperature gets too high, so there is not supposed
to be damage from overheating. But just turning off
and turning on a large computer tends to make some weak
components show up. We often suffer thru a few days
of poor performance before returning to normal. There is
a lot of mechanical work going on to try to insure that
these kinds of cooling failures do not recur.

The math and science textbooks and journals _all_ agree
that 1/3x means 1/(3x), so the TUTOR operation hierarchy
_does_ "agree with the mathematics". Could you give an
example where there is a discrepancy between math
notation and TUTOR notation?

On the other hand we recognize that it is a common
mistake for students to write 1/3x when they mean
(1/3)x. We hope to make it easy for students to
write ˆ1=-=?3x, which is unambiguous. This is the only
way I know of to get around the ambiguity problem, which
really arises due to the limitations of a typewritten
as opposed to a typeset line.

This is a real problem. The key was put in a shifted
position because many students in lessons that did not
use TERM were accidently hitting the key and becoming
hasseled by not knowing what to make of the funny message
at the bottom of the screen. It was felt that the provision
of imain (allowing a single branch key to be used throughout
a lesson for the same purpose) would take care of the
majority of TERM applications (and eliminate the problem
of spelling at TERMs)-the balance of users would be authors
or students needing extensive instruction anyway (say,
because 20-30 terms were available). Could we have
comments from people who have used lessons wtih TERM for
MANY students?

---------- response 2
  04/05     10.02     shlosberg       com

for all the accountancy lessons, a NEXT1 implemented
through an imain unit takes the student to the index for
the lesson. this has almost entirely eliminated the need
for the student to use the TERM key.
in fact, the only time our students have any reason to
use the term key is to reply to a monitor, and even though
our introductory lesson explains how to "find" the TERM
key, i generally find it necessary to tell the student to
"press TERM (shift+TERM) to reply". since we generally do
not use the ANS key, teh phrase "shift+ANS" would probably
confuse the situation rather than help it.
perhaps, if ANS is not active in a particular situation,
pressing the ANS key should trigger the message:
    "if you want the TERM key press SHIFT+ANS" at the
bottom of the student's screen. (back to the old cryptic
message problem again....)

To any knowledgable system person:

Re: Cursor positioning when creating characters

Does the cursor have a built in upper bound on the
rate in can be driven? I.E. suppose that I could type
as fast as the communication lines would permit,
would the cursor move once for each key that got sent?
Coming from the ARPA network keys get packaged together

keys in other lessons, but when I create characters
any keys that get sent together seem to be ignored.

   In response to an earlier comment that fixes had been
made "months ago" so that STOP1 would sign people out
from the AUTHOR MODE and end-of-lesson displays:
   Indeed it does NOT do so, but rather merely takes
one to the STUDENT MODE display. I have just now fixed
the end-of-lesson display so that STOP1 does in fact
sign one off the system; fixing the oterh will take a
little more work.

---------- response 1
  04/05     09.03     rader       s

Of course it only took one to the "STUDENT MODE, display;
I doubt that authors really want to get signed out on
"STOP1" keypresses from "any" page in the system: what
I do feel is important is that it should take an author
someplace reasonable (and not be a "dead" key).

It is certainly true that -STOP1- will never be quite the
same for an author as for a student--and I think that it
may be quite desirable not to sign out authors from the
many pages where we plan to activate -STOP1-. This
raises the original "sign-on" message again--maybe one
day we will find a convenient way to detect new authors
and give them a different message! It would seem that
this could be handled even better by the author training
manuals, however.

   Authors are indeed special and I agree completely with
Bob Rader that these are "special" people who simply have
to have some training/information given them before being
turned loose on the system--like the existence of aids and
notes and how to edit, etc. I do think that the "resting"
places I mentioned are indeed points where we can reasonably
sign people off the system--it does NOT seem reasonable to
do so when someone is in the midst of entering a codeword!

It has always been true that the system variables

and operations encountered in a compute, store, ansv,

Since the discussion (HELP note $209) of a -replace- command

several favorable comments, perhaps it is worthy of
general interest. It would go something like this:

replace string,slength,old,olength,new,nlength

Apparently it is only a question of priority, but the
way I do so many things now seems very messy by comparison.

Also, I again request that the number of responses to a
note be shown (instead of an R). So many ongoing (or
would-be ongoing) discussions get buried and lost, because

A string replace will undoubtedly come. Note that one
nasty problem is how best to specify in the command
the length of your working buffer, so as not to overrun
your variables that follow in cases where the string
expands greatly as a result of the replacements.
A little-known fact is that the -put- command (and -putd-
and -putv-) switches from judging to regular state if
the replacements cause expansion beyond the 120-char (?)
judging buffer. There is also a "no" judgement. All this
is similar to what the -store- command does.

All of the previous are indeed helpful salves for the
wound but do not represent any cure--especially not
in the usual case in which one is in a hurry! Why
does the system need to know the course? Why isn't
there an up-to-date directory of a) real names;
b)sign-on names; c)course name since this is in the
machine anyhow!? I've heard it said that the reason
is privacy but that makes no sense since one can always
turn OFF talk options anyhow. Additional suggestion:
talk options should be ON rather than automatically
OFF at a new author's first sign-on. Thanks for

        The default state for new authors is OFF simply

---------- note 231 concurrent
  04/05     18.13     state       ames
In noticing your beautiful advance to the realm of
controlled computation (re. backgnd) has there been
any consideration of making concurrent unit processing?

In other words, some lessons would run much better if
sections were considered as concurrent (or parrallel run
sections). As an example, say a lesson has an interactive
input that accepts the arrow keys (like cursor) and the
lesson also moves the cursor with a simple loop computation
each keypress. One problem is that the times a keypress
is encountered the I/O is slowed considerably. If the
two processes were labeled concurrent (like: cunit or
something of this sort) then one could accept keypresses
and the other do the output and computation cycle.

Dal, are you talking about: 1) using a parallel computer
to run two units of the same program; 2) having CPU 0 run
unit a while CPU 1 runs unit b; or, 3) having one CPU
execute the individual program steps of units a and b
in an alternating mode?

a) We don't have a parallel computer; the only one in the
word, ILLIAC IV, has an average UP time of 1 second of less.

b) Possibility unknown, probability 0.

c) Unusual suggestion with severe ramifications.

Your best bet -- and mine too, as I would also like the
EFFECT of having concurrent unit processing -- lies in the
potential of the "smart" terminals, which hopefully will
one day have their own mini-cPU to handle certain terminal
specific computations; I'm guessing -- praying -- on this
one.

UNIVAC 1108 has multiprocessors, so does a minicomputer
network(!) developped at Cornell, and some IBM/360-67
installations can run 2 CPU's. ILLIAC IV is
definitely not what you are talking about, since it only
executes the same instruction on 64 processing
elements. PS: PLATO runs on a 2 CPU computer.

The ramifications of even having 2 PLATO CPU's run 2
students in the same lesson are bad... think of
each student modifying common but in a lock-out fashion.
If both CPU's could access common you'd be under
the current TUTOR in severe trouble.

will fix it (eventually) so an appropriate error message

I appreciate the desire to demonstrate PLATO. Ti is
impressive and some of the games are truly our best show-
cases. However, until I get about 25,000 more words of ECS
I'll slaughter anyone who plays games at my site during the

Don't blame Rick, blame people like me who are trying to

        My guess is that that was clock-time speed. The cpu
interrupts condenses often (at least 60 times per second) to
do other jobs.
        So the actual condensor speed is somewhat faster.
        Also there is some delay in getting your lesson
off the disk and to the condensor. I don't know whether
the number quoted includes that time. I think it does.

When the hinted at short-wait-for-condense for short lessons

condensed, but no execution done because of condense errors
and the user has backed up to author mode again (via STOP1).
Many times a small typo is all that has fouled up the

the system folks know how much is saved on the average.
If there is a saving, this might make a nice addition. TL

If you want to save some new stuff, the old stuff is

neither the inspect nor the change code, he is given the

of the lesson to change his code and get out of

What you probably did...was to start out by doing a long
insert...then doing the unfortunate delete...then in a
panic doing the OUT...but (just a guess) since you never
backed out to the lesson block page after the insert...the
insert was never written out to the disk...it existed only
in the electronic-core-memory of the computer...and doing
the OUT then returned to the lesson block page...without
putting anything out onto the disk system.

"store err" seems to happen whenever it tries to process
one thing and finds another-- usually it is looking for an
assignment and finds an expression. The " doto" in the
command field is somehow connected to the fact that -doto-
and -calc- are not really processed as separate commands.
(During step mode, calcs following a doto are counted as
part of the doto when it tells you which statement of the
unit it's in).

In case you're wondering, that's "hardware".
It means the machine would have to be changed, or
an entirely new interpretation of the -move- command
would have to be written up. Perhaps a segmented

of -movebit-?

   A movebit type command would require far too much code
for too little benefit (relatively). Design your data
formats to use full words for speed or in multiples of
6 bit chaps for greater packing with some semblance of
speed left for searches and moves.

Well, here we go again........No, the system has a
very very difficult time distinguishing "good" use
from "bad" use. Which is precisely why ecs space
has been allocated to clusters of terminals so the 
people affected can humanely scream at each other
rather than have an inhuman computer algorithm guessing
"good" from " bad". If you have "legitimate" work to
be done, and you can't get it done because of
people playing around, then complain to them. If they
are in CERL classrooms, use the posted priorities to
back up your complaints. If you encounter violations
of the stated policies and lack of cooperation, you
may politely threaten them with the loss of those
sign-on records and a systems person will be happy to
assist you.

        The course is intended for those people who either
are required to or desire to learn enough about the guts of
the terminal and remote end communications equipment to in-
teract helpfully with the Urbana located maintaince people.
The assumption about the level of expertice of the students
at the beginning of the course will be 1) a basic knowledge
of boolean logic and its implementation in integrated
circuits (7400 series) 2) a basic knowledge of general
trouble shooting procedures (look here with VOM, etc.)

    The entire class (terminal, communications equip)
will only last one week so it will have to move quickly.

reference to the fact that my listings of empire were
being stolen and that I had finally received two (thanks

---------- note 368 penalty
  04/11     09.50     gfl       mtcc

It may be of interest to assess the penalty being paid by
using the -calcs- command, and by segmenting. In a lesson
of mine which contained a lot of conditional branching,
elimination of some 90; of the -calcs- statements and of
something like 95; of the references to segmented variables
reduced the condensed size of the lesson by 671 words (in
20 blocks), i.e. 10; savings!!! I also discovered that
displays went on the screen faster using -doto- and -branch-
rather than -calcs-.

---------- response 1
  04/11     11.47     b sherwood       phys

Yes indeed. branch and doto are by far the fastest way
to do loops. On the other hand, if each iteration of the
loop is long, the loop overhead imposed by -do- or -goto-
may not be significant. -calcs- is slower than some other
structures (such as -branch-) but it is hard to say
anything in general, since what -calcs- does may in some
cases be exceedingly difficult to do any other way.
The use of segmented variables in loops should certainly
be avoided, since there is a big overhead in shifting and
masking to do the associated byte manipulation. Again,
if you are not in a tight loop segmented variables are
not going to penalize you noticeably.

     Is it possible to force the + used when

     My lesson uses an -altfont on- and a

     centering difficult and fruitless.
     Me

---------- response 1
  04/11     14.50     holzmzn       uimc

yes, one way to overcome this is to copy the octal code
for the + char (or design it youself and copy the char code
for it).
insert in your define set the following
char 37$$ 37 is the key ¬$ for the + key.
     0xxxxxx,0xxxxxx,0xxxxxx,0xxxxxx
     0xxxxxx,0xxxxxx,0xxxxxx,0xxxxxx

this will load ault. chat which looks like the buildin +.
of course if your lesson has charset allready you need
only add the + char. (hope that you're not useing it
allready.)

after rereading your note, if you force font you must have
a charset, so just use second suggestion. (think eli.)

will be maintaince oriented and include 1) the terminal
and its theory, operation and repair. 2) 202 communications
equipment located at the remote installation, theory,
operation and repair, 3) 4800 bps communication equipment
located atthe remore installation, theory, operation, and
repair.
        Very little will be discussed af a general nature
related to extra equipment because the intent of the
course is to familiarize the remote users with the equip-
ment that has to be maintained by our (CERL) staff so that
they might assist us in this operation.

---------- note 7  init micro
  04/14     22.40     warner       tutoring

How about a way of initializing a micro table to the
standard micro table, or a copy of the standard micro
table (the one that duplicates the access key) in some
copiable lesson somewhere, which we can then copy to
our own lessons and edit as necessary? Presently the
micro option initializes all undefined micros to inoperable
zeroes. This is fine if you are designing, say, micros for
the lower-case letters from a to z, but suppose you are
editing a lesson with that micro in effect and you need
¬= or ¬0 or ¬<? Or suppose you are a student in a calculator
and need those options?

---------- response 1
  04/14     22.56     frye       css

You use "SQUARE1"......that's the access key.

The access charset is part of the standard charset,
which is always "loaded" in the terminal....so it can
always be reached.

example of a use of the "access" charset:

instead of pressing "micro"-"0" for the "¬0" symbol,
you can press SHIFT-SQUARE....which is the access key....
then "0".......no, all this stuff is NOT thoroughly
documented.....it's another case of

"Try it, you'll wish you hadn't known...."

of course, the average student doesn't know about any
of this stuff, so...........

---------- response 2
  04/14    23.11     warner       tutoring

Sure, but suppose you want to design a micro table with
most of those characters already built in? As of now
you have to manually insert the SHIFT-SQUARE key almost
everywhere in the micro table except those few places where
you want it to work as a micro key! What I would like is
a source from which the ACCESS micro can be duplicated
for use on all lessons in which some vestige of normal
operation is required, with only a few micros!

And while we're on the subject, please make MICRO active
as well as ACCESS in the charset editor. It's a pain in
the *ss to press SHIFT-SQUARE every time you need to insert
a character in one of the accessed slots.

I have added an otion to lesson help which permits authors

available. To use this option, press TERM on the first
page for "author and test aids", then enter a number.
As of the moment, you may enter 200, 300, or 400 to truncate
the information presented in help in various ways. Contact
me about adding other truncation options.
I have also removed the message
"Press TERM for author and test aids"
from the screens of _students_ using lesson help.
Authors will still see this message, and TERM will remain
active for students in lesson help, at that point.

It sure is annoying to be away from plato for a few days,
and have help notes reinitialized, and lose track of an
ongoing conversation. These do take place in help notes,
and quite properly so. When they are reinitialized, the 
last few comments are copied into the new file, but that
still leaves some stuff out.?
What I'm leading up to is simply a request that the most
recent SINGLE file of help notes be kept available until
the next reinitialization. This could be one more option
on the first page of notes. ONLY ONE old set of help
notes would be kept. The point is that one could catch
up on replies, possibly made within the last few days, to
notes which were not near enough to the end of the file to
get copied into the new file.?
I know things like this have been suggested before, but I
I don't think quite this suggestion has been made.

For the moment -- you can copy block "standard" from

You (DMA) may have thought of this before you made jumpout
to a different router an error, but this may cause some
inconvenience with students from one course accessing the
indexes of certain subject areas. In particular, the index
to accounting lessons is in the router (and I believe this
is where it belongs under the current PLATO structure). This
will require that any other courses which wish to use that
index will either have to:? 
  1. Use no router.
  2. Use our router.
  3. Duplicate the index in their router.?
I guess I am asking what the benefits are since I believe
there is some cost to this change.

The basic question (objection?) has not been answered.
DMA's announcement seems to say that a jumpout from one
router to another by a student will not work.
1) Is that true?
2) If so, why?
I realize that some people write router lessons that won't
work unless they really are the router for the student.
But it's entirely possible to write a router lesson
which will work if entered as an ordinary lesson; I have
done so (in lesson csrouter) by checking the system
variable -router- against my router lesson's name; if not
equal, I know the lesson is not executing as a router,
and I've coded it to function simply as an index.?
And also: why not a little user consultation on something
like this BEFORE making the change? *':$]?/*??$:

  04/15     18.27     blomme       s

  The problem is that even when doing a "backwards" find,
the specification of the other parameters is the same.
Your command says to search backwards ok and to store
result in variable n150 ok, but it also says that the
locations to search START at n100 and that there are 99 to
look at counting from there! Since this goes past 150,
an execution error results. The following will examine
variables starting with n100 and going to n1:
find 25,n1,100,n150,-1
   Specifying the backwards case is sort of messy no matter
how you do it...also remember that the return value is the
offset from n1 (and not from where the search started in
this case)!

Since it compiles calcs like a compiler, assembles
most command/tag instructions into direct code for the
simulted TUTOR machine, and translates the two dimensional
tags into an internal form of printed English, why not
call it an "asspilator" or maybe a "transsempiler" or
even "comsemblator". No doubt reasons like these are why
it is called a condensor.

  If you mean that if you search for -a-, the editor
stops at lines which contain -A-, you are correct. But
you should note that if you X search for an -A-, the
editor will not stop at lines which contain -a-, without an
-A-.
  There is a good reason for this. The reason is that
"a"=001, and "A"=o7001. If you look closely, you will
notice that "A" actually does contain "a", and this is
why the editor stops there.
It is unlikely that this situation will change.

This may not be the source of your problem, but then again
it might be. Where, wherex, and wherey are updated each time
slice, so if there are a lot of references to these
such that they are referenced more than once during any
given time slice, you get the old position and not the
one expected.

---------- response 2
  04/16     16.43     b sherwood       phys

Not quite. I think that only the -showa- command does
not update "where" itself (so that only at the end of
a "time-slice" will the where info be correct). I think
that the erase command has never updated where, or rather
left it at the previous position, due to uncertainty over
which was appropriate, given the common case of writing
at the same postion just after erasing at that position.

On the other hand, maybe it is "obvious" that -erase-
should leave "where" at the end of the erase line.

---------- response 3
  04/16     18.44     rowell       m

Thanks for the clear up. Had never realized the case with

It is true that the -erase- command does not update "where"
--and probably also true that it is convenient--however,
remember that in this case there is disagreement between
the actual screen position and the value in "where".
I.e., you do have to use an -at where- after the erase
to reposition the screen.

it would be VERY convenient if the "?" key in the editor
would take you forward the ¬$ of lines on the screen, not
how many are supposed to be there!........

e.g........look at a page in the editor which has some
two-line (more than 6 words) lines........
press <space> twice........
press "?".........
look at a new page 30 lines ahead of where the top of the
screen was before.........
and if you have some hairy long lines, this can be
_very_ messy.......

for it to take one forward a fixed number of lines, as 8 or

I see what frey says, but it won't be fixed.
He means that if there are lines that are continued
in the block, and the screen on the screen are (for example)
28 lines , and '?' is pressed it goes forward 30 lines...

Because the edito(e)r thinks it sent out 31 lines
and the terminal (NOTE the hardward terminal) says
oh he is writting off the screen onto line 32...
on, stop that...
etc...
I'm sure this can be explained much better....

What Marshall seems to be saying is that the editor _isn't_
_aware_ that it only sent 26 lines, or whatever...that
actually, the terminal is being sent the full 31 lines, but
that the ones that would be plotted off the screen are
simply ignored by the hardware in the terminal. Since
the editor doesn't have the smarts to figure out how many
lines are actually being displayed, the ? key in particular
doesn't know either. And, considering processing
limitations in the editor, I would doubt that such smarts
would be forthcoming.

I agree with those who want ? and = to equal 10 lines
per hit. It may be ok for some to hop merrily through
a block with the ? as it is now, but for those of us
who also try to back up it's a royal pain to not be able
to back up the same increment you go forward. My
suggestion would to allow 'shift ?' to take you forward
the number of lines displayed, and 'shift =' to back
you up the number of lines displayed. If + and - equal
fixed increments forward and back, then by gum, so should
the ? and = be fixed increments (ie. 10 lines each) forward
and back!! If shifted + and - are end and beginning of
block commands, why not shifted = and ? to do the same
for lines displayed. Believe it or not, some of us did
use the decimal ? and = to count the number of lines in
a unit for save/delete purposes. So PLEASE, let's return
to the good old days when men were men, and when ? and =
where 10 !

I vote to leave the ? the way it is now. I used to
almost always want L30 in effect, and this had its
disadvantages; but the way it is now, if I'm reading
code, I just press ? to go on to the next line that
I want to see -- no matter how many lines are on the
screen.?
If enough people are bothered by the present scheme,
perhaps another key could be used to move forward some
fixed ¬$ of lines, or the ¬$ specified by the last L.

You missed my point, Tom. If a define set has in it, say,

defined, n6-n60 not, then n61-n85 defined -- the effect
of a calc setname?somevalue would eliminate some messy
doto loops. Actually, the suggestion is a relatively minor

Here is an idea for a variable or function:

It would either tell the number of chars in an answer-
like jcount except jcount tells number of 6 bit segments
used. Thus an answer of "Yes" (exclude " from the answer)
would have a jcount of 4 but a charcnt (a possible name for

If charcnt(x) was a function it would scan vars x, x+1,....
till it found a single or double byte zero.

One messy way of calculating true plot length of an arbitrary

The system will update the wherex/wherey for you to deter-
your end point after the showa. i.e. If at an arrow just
storea the string, switch to mode erase at some empty portion
of the screen, embedded showa it, switch back to mode write,
and finally calculate the true plot length.--wu

How about a systems response on this matter?
What is the likelyhood that we would know plot count
for the student answer? In languages this is and has
been much needed since we have to use accents which
require many characters. The jcount for an accented
letter is usually something like 5 or 6 while all of these
characters are plotted on _one_ plot space. I indeed asked
for this information many moons ago--I gave up when I
realized there were no ears for my words.

Isnt this a fringe "benefit" from efficient packing of 
"characters" into 6 bit codes, when in fact there are
actually 12 bits of information often used to identify 
the character?i.e. the character gets preceded by one or
maybe more shift,font,font1 etc. codes.
While the current Plato technique results in admirable 
reliability of handling, we sometimes wonder what could
have been achieved if a 12 bit representation in storage
had been used, for example, for characters in a student
response. (Not of course for screen text which is not
generally "manipulated"). Would it make implementation
easier? It doesnt seem possible for any generalized
solution to satisfy all however since the designation of 
RAM character addresses could be characters or ducks
depending on program interpretation.(We use them frequently
for an alternate character set.) The guy who implements
this one will have long job security.

imain, at least in the old version of tutor, does not
even allow a smooth transition from one main unit to
another. When two imain units are in consecutive order,
the writing isn't changed nor is the slide
bulb turned off.

I am requesting a command which will allow me to use less
space in authoring, not by working around and changing
the position of the slide 512 command.

I want the unit command to turn the thing off and save me
two words each time I want to use some text rather than a 
fiche.

If I want the slide to remain on thru several units, I can
use the new command ( inhibit slide ) or join the new unit.

---------- response 1

If slides were turned off when the end of a unit were
encountered, slides in units without arrows would flash
on and off before students could see them. Unless I 
am misinterpreting your request, the current approach
seems easiest. You can turn a slide off by the appropriate
slide command as part of an answer (or after a pause as
in your earlier example). Use of full screen erase and 
do or goto allows easy alteration of writing against
the same slide.

There seems to be a bit of confusion about the behavior 
of slides...........
Slides are not automatically turned off when entering
a new main unit. They must be turned off with a 
slide 512 command. Actually this is convenient, since
it permits full screen erase without having the slide
flick off and back on. (There doesn't seem to be anything 
about this question in aids...should there be?)

---------- response 1
  04/17     19.32     b sherwood       phys

Is it better that way, or would it be better to have
the slide normally turned off, in which case you would
need to inhibit erase and then do an erase (blank)?
For that matter, does an erase (blank) turn off the
slide? Those of you who have used slides, what is 
appropriate????? My own prejudice has always been that
normally a main unit should initialize everything in 
sight, including erasing the screen, clearing the slide,
clearing the help-like pointers, etc. I wish that 
size and rotate were cleared upon entering a new main
unit! (But that particular initialization is not done.)

your preferences, preferably with reasons.

The only thing that turns off a slide is a slide 512
command. I think that what you are suggesting would mean
that there would be no way to change units without having
the slide go off. It seems less complex to put a 
slide 512 in your imain unit, if this is what you want,
than to have some sort of inhibit slideoff option, which
would be needed if slides automatically went off in a new
unit.

If entering a new unit does not turn off a slide (and it 
doesn't), then one must not only turn a slide off once,
but also in all units which follow the slide. If there
is no slide to turn off, the terminal clicks at you,
trying to shut off something that wasn't turned on in the
first place. Or is that clear? Anyway, I'm with you,

  04/18     12.59     fuller       users

Sorry for the previously incoherent note....
I have 2 bugs for your perusal:
1) I was looking at the note labelled notesbug above,
and the very glitch the note referred to was duplicated
in the reply.... Tryed to reply to the note and was backed
out... upon reentry Avner's reply was _fixed_... tried it
on another note with similar results...
2) When DMA signed all the unused terminals on last
night for testing, I was talking to Purdue Ft. Wayne.
We _both_ got our terminal switches reset, causing havoc
on the air... Note that I was on a new terminal and he was
on an old one,.. In any case,

Since everybody is getting personalized T-shirts, I thought
why not.. Campus Book Store gave me a reasonable bid: $3.50
The t-shirt is orange
The front will have:-name-,-course- in small letters,
probably white.
The back will have PRESS -NEXT- in 2" letters, navy blue.
SEND:1) your name and adress
2)a check for $3.50 payable to "Campus Book Store"
3)size (s-m-l-xl)
4)names to be put in front, i.e., sign on, and course.
TO: A. Armengol. G-89, F.L.B. Urbana, Ill, 61801
BEFORE next thursday, april 25.
REMOTE SITES: If you absolutely have to have one, send ME
additional money for postage, that YOU will have to figure
out.
If we don't get more than 15 orders, "nogo".
I will keep you posted.
If you want the words "plato" in the front, instead of 
course and/or name, say so when you order.

Yes indeed...the markup uses the number of 6-bit codes to

It may be quite a while before this is fixed to account

How about a system resonse, perhaps from DMA, to the

in system note ¬$49 about router lessons??
I just tested, and found that, using student records,
I could successfully jumpout from my own router lesson
to another router-type lesson (from csrouter to uimathr).
So what does announcement ¬$49 really mean, if it does
not mean that the above jumpout will no longer work?

I have a simplified binary show unit which requires only
two variables in lesson iu4, block b, unit bindec(arg).
This unit is used in the following manner;
at xx02 $$ must be less than 04 line position
do bindec(something)
This will produce a display in which the bits which are
on will be numbered, and those which are off will be
represented by periods. To see this lesson in action,
condense block b only of lesson iu4. You will see a given 
octal number displayed in binary, then there will be an
enabled pause following which the value of key will be
shown in binary.
Library people please note..this routine is much smaller
both condensed and uncondensed than the present routine,
largely due to TUTOR improvements like args and embeds.

This isnt a biggy but rather a nicey. Wouldnt it be grand 
if "notes" could tuck away in a person's records what the
number of the last note he read was. In this way a person
could read notes starting automatically at the last note
read and avoid wasting time, keypresses, and disk accesses
wadeing through old turf. Surely there must be a few bits
left somewhere in the bank (maybe 10 is enough) to
facilitate this. It might even allow the reduction or
elimination of that moderately annoying new features page
that always appears in favor of a simple "there is a new
feature you havent read yet" message when appropriate
although the biggest savings in effort would be in the 
general interest notes. Anyone interested?

more simply how about this: upon entering notes, type the
time and date of the last time you checked notes. Since the 
time and date of all notes and responses are kept now, fix
notes to show any "new" notes and old notes that have "new"
responses. Even if the necessary bits to keep this one
piece of info couldnt be found, an author could find a
way to remember his last visit to notes.

This seems like a good way, Bruce, I dont think i could 
remember the last time i signed on nearly as well as Plato.
I just thought the note number might be easier to save and
handle, but i guess that depends on how the notes are
stored and cataloged internally. I dont mind paging back
through looking for a specific reply, as i am likely to
remember the name of such a note; where i seem to spend a
lot of time is trying to remember whether i have read
certain notes which were not of particular interest, and 
yet those are the one i seem to read several times while 
trying to determine whether i have read them. Any imple-
mentation of this ability would sure be nice. Cookies

    The great common-to-source-conversion monster has
struck again!
    In uimc7 at 8:50ˆ+=?- tonite I created a new block after
block g, specified "copy-a-block", and copied block g from the same lesson.
    Checked that new block h was same as old g
(thus returned h, then g to disk), then reentered h and
hit _data1_. Noticed that the usual c_aution___-_______=====press NEXT===_=_ 
message was not displayed - _data1_ just returned me to
block-index with block h marked source.
         Inspection showed that h contained a copy of
block _e_ - which I hadn't inspected at all. Name still
matches that of _g_.
         This is almost what the monster did the other times
I've met him; only now he garbages with stuff from same

Please don't forget that the mode-changing features you
described were never advertised (at least not the way most
of the other TUTOR features are)...they were put in to make
the embedded ¬0mode¬1 possible. Since we did not expect
people to be using them in the way you describe, it will
probably be a while before we fix any "bugs" in them (I put
'bugs' in quotes because they are not really bugs...the
features work fine when we put them to use doing what they
were designed to do).

I'm responsible for csstudent of css, but I thought it 
was carefully protected against getting to ANY non-cs
lesson. If anyone could enlighten me as to how a user
of csstudent got into a game, I will try to correct.
The only way I know of doing it, requires the collusion
of an author of a cs lesson, who puts a jumpout in his
lesson to get to a game; if I catch any cs author under
my guidance doing THAT, he won't be a cs author much
longer!

A -judge continue- command is not legal after a -pause-.
In step mode, every command is -pause-d, so any judge
continues bomb off. Someone is working on this, I believe,
but right now, you can't step through judge continues
successfully.

(I believe if the tag of the judge command is ok, no, 
or ignore, you can step through it.)

   I agree with David Frankel's evaluation of the
situation in note 178 about undocumented features 
not being, shall we say, supported by the system.
However, it iritates me somewhat to constantly read
notes and find that some users find thing out that 
aren't documented and nobody is supposed to know about.
When PLATO4 first came into existance, much was left
undocumented and little was left secure ( I found it
quite easy to get into non-secure places to find out
things ). Now, however, the system is secure, at least
the fact was stated many moons ago in the old, old note
files, and the system is documented (to a degree).
   Why then are there people (not necessarily systems)
who have access to hidden deep dark secrets? PLATO seems
too much of a clique for a user system.

indeed, one is uniformly impressed by the lack of a

practices which are proscribed. i don't intend to refer
here to the technical conventions of "authoring", but
rather to the social codes governing content of the
material the authors place in their lessons. i know we
generally invoke in such discussions the principle of
academic freedom but freedoms always entail obligations
as well as privileges. perhaps cerl should attempt to
be more specific as to these obligations?

Yes, this will not only make it easier on new authors, but
it would also reduce the endless requests for things such as
access to the names of people in course such-and-such,
an option to find out the course of a given person, lists
of lesson names, etc.
All of these are perpetually being explained as being
against cerl policy. but they keep being asked....

---------- response 4
  04/21     09.37     john r       r1

I don't pretend to be making an official general statement
about CERL policy, but the principle of an author's right
to privacy pervades many of the specific policies. The
names of lessons are not automatically in the public domain
since an author may not have them in finished form and since
they may not be intended for general public consumption.

The policy about the simulation of system pages has the
same roots. It is possible to use such simulations
maliciously to garner private information. The
possibilities for abuse of such pages far outweigh whatever
redeeming social value (amusement?) they may have.

My own disturbance with Mr. Fortner's "joke" had more to do
with its nuisance value. It caused some anxiety and
the waste of more than a man-hour of time, including the
time of two members of the senior systems staff.

We were told to keep the rear of the terminal at least 6"

The ambient room temperature, ideally, should be below
75¬oF. Tests over the last few months have shown that, as
the temperature goes beyond this point, the internal temp
starts climbing at an astounding rate.
The temp specs on most of the IC's in the panel and the
logic cards is around 104-106¬oF, and the internal temp,
particularly close to the IC's themselves, can reach 115¬o
in a room with an ambient of 85¬o.
The maintaince people downstate have a fairly firm policy
on room temps: if it is over 72¬o in the room and one of
the terminals is not working, they turn them all off and
wait for the temperature to go down.
PLATO terminals are tough, but they have their limitations.
If you can maintain a temperature under 75¬o, do so. You'll
also be better off if you CLEAN THE FILTERS

For "THE LIST":

        Please consider the following:
1) A system defined variable indicating the amount of time
since the last unscheduled shutdown (crash).
2) A system defined variable indicating the amount of time
since the last scheduled shutdown (backout).
3) Either dynamic execution time control over the
frequency of checkpointing via the router, or else, the
ability to specify auto checkpointing every X minutes
through course records.
4) re: 2 above, a variable to indicate how long until a
backout.

These sorts of things might make it a live option to run
students during non-production hours, and with fewer
hassles during the existing "production" hours. I believe
that to assume that one day the system will be all well

As to 1,2,4: I doubt that even if we gave you such
information that it would really help--what you need to
be able to do is predict a crash--and if we could we
would avoid the crash. As to 4--what are you going to do
differently if we tell you by a variable (as we now do with
a message) that a backout is coming?

As to (3)--automated checkpointing--this has the obvious
problem that it is easy to turn on and unlikely to be
turned off. Such a feature would ultimately cut into our
ability to service terminals. On the other hand, if we
cannot achieve adequate reliability, this may become
necessary--but not yet.

I can see that it would be nice when testing a lesson

sign out and sign in again with a reasonable restart.
Since the editor clobbers one's variables, this doesn't
work for authors. Unfortunately it may be a long while
before any such major change is made, partly because of
the extra ECS required. On the other hand, we might be
able to declare some restricted set of student variables
as off limits to the editor (and charset, service, etc.)
so that limited restarts could be done for lesson testing.

RE: note 224...........You are correct about numbers 1,2,¬+4
being aimed at predicting crashes and backouts, however,
not in the way you might think. The suggestion was
intended as a package deal in that if all four capabilities
were present one could write into his or her router lesson
an algorithm to intelligently decide how often checkpointing
is needed. System crashes seem to come and go in related
groups (new peice of equipment, air condt. failure, series
of related ECS troubles, etc.). If the router can detect
how recent the last crash was, it could decide to checkpoint
every X minutes where X is a function of the length of time
since the last crash. This is a crude algorithm,
but speaking from experience, I know it would have helped
some of our 250 student users this term some of whom were

I don't know, no one wants to publish such info. But
intuitively, given the experiences of this last semester.
my bet is that given a few crashes, the probability of a
reccurance within the next one hour period jumps to a fairly
high level and stays there a few days. The reason: when
ECS starts to fail, it tends to go with a general malady
as do several other types of crashes. Maybe Avner could
supply some more acute observations along these lines?

---------- response 4

On the contrary, the PLATO evaluation group produces a
monthly report on system reliability (available to
readers of PLATO PRESS).  The conditional probability of
a crash given that a crash has recently occurred is
rather high with the current problems (normally it would
be low since a tried-and-true version would be substituted)
ECS errors tend to be either fatal (and repaired immediately 
at great cost in down time for that hour) or quickly
recovered from with rather low probability of reoccurrance.
The liklihood of a class-hour being interupted by at

   the "press" command, for some time, has not caused
   an execution error when executed too frequently.

   I don't recall seeing any documentation of this
   change.

   Even though it was a bit harsh, the execution
   error did provide some feedback concerning the
   success or failure of an attempt to "press" a key.
   Is there any way to sense whether a press command
   succeeded or was aborted because of time
   constraints?

There was a note in "new features" notes some time back.
I believe it is in old new features notes (e) by now.
Essentially it said that a -press- command will now do
a -pause 1- when appropriate to eliminate the execution 
error.

The 2-argument -press- does at least signal when a press
is not made by setting the value of the system variable
"error" to 0 for a bad press, or -1 for a good one.
Honestly, this should be written up somewhere in aids!!!

Help notes seem to be full so I'll put it here. This may
seem trivial but how about a -term- time in student mode,
which would return the correct time at the appropriate site.
I realize that with the great extent of the plato system
there are many different sites with different times, but
surely if something as difficult as -term- step can be done
well can the right time be far behind.

   Surely you wouldn't have much trouble putting such an
option in your own lesson, knowing the location of the
terminals you are concerned about (and the relationship
of your local time to the plato "base" time).

Indeed in all lessons I write there is a little time ¬+ date
box in the upper right hand corner. However, in looking at
various lessons thru sample, etc. I have noted that time
displays are lacking in a large number of those lessons.
This could be corrected by -term- time with an appropriate
help sequence in say lesson "help" to tell the student the
option is there.

My concern is for the student off somewhere without a watch
or clock sitting in front of PLATO working on a lesson that
he/she would rather not -stop1- wondering what time it was.

   HELP1 has been associated (only by a somewhat strange
convention I agree) with options which destroy things.
For that reason I rather dislike having the E option of
the editor on that key (for, should I miss that e key
and get d, I now destroy material) since it does not
destroy anything, although it may inconveniece one
for a moment if hit accidentally. I definitely oppose
any further expansion in the use of HELP1.

---------- response 6

     SS and Q options in the editor already work when
shifted, so what I am really asking is that you inhibit
the non-shifted SS and the non-shifted Q. Perhaps the E
option should be shift-only too. (Instead of using help1)

Bruce:
After reviewing the responses to gen notes 244 and 260, I've
decided to chance wrath by bringing up the issue once more.
Everyone seems to assume that one day PLATO will reach some
undefined static stage where reliability problems will be
a thing of the past. I certainly hope they are right. BUT
on the other hand what is going to happen when more AMS is
added, or more ECS (if added), or more 844's or when the
cpu needs upgrading, or when you decide to link high speed
lines to other PLATO sites. If better checkpointing measures
are not added, I think there will be a real din of com-
plaints then when more people are running students. The
kind of checkpointing I have suggested could (for reasons
Bob Rader pointed out) better be handled on the systems
level than in the router lessons. But (lab)....

---------- response 1
  04/23     13.29     deiss       phar

It seems to me that such would be a small concession to the
student users considering all the trivia being done to
make things easier for authors (such as Q-ing out of the
editor to aids, NEXT-ing out of notes responses to the next
note, or the suggestion to shift - out of the editor to
notes).
It might yield a considerable increase of computing and
disc accesses. But the need for something of this sort
seems inevitable.

then i got a condense error:
 do q81,q82.... (the 81ˆsˆt unit...)
finally after adding one more *do* the condense errors
disappeared.
are there any official limits? if so, what are they?
and shouldn't they be documented somewhere?

There can be 100 arguments in the tag of a -do-, -join-,
-goto-, (and I presume -jump-, but I didn't test that one).

Apparently the rule for condense errors is
   If there are more than 101 arguments, the 101st is
   flagged as an error.

   If there are exactly 101 arguments, the 81st is flagged
   as an error.

This must be a strong contender for the title of strangest
diagnostic of all time!

We will add this information to aids.

Experiments show that *errtype* is set to 3 when a lesson

complete jumpout) does not appear to cover this situation.
Worse, any message generated (in the error unit of a router)
saying "Your jumpout failed due to lack of memory",etc. is

Do you think we could have another value of *errtype* to

  04/24     00.18     kane       phys

Concerning the labeling of axes that have been log scaled
with a 2 argument lscaley (lscalex) command:

Specifying an offest of 10ˆ3, 10ˆ6, 10ˆ7, 10ˆ1ˆ1, etc(?) causes
the labeling to be off by a decade. Eg. scaley 10ˆ4,10ˆ3
labels the y axis from 10ˆ2 to 10ˆ3. Other offest values
(10ˆ1, 10ˆ2, 10ˆ4, etc) don't seem to produce this problem.

---------- response 1
  04/24     07.32     michael       english

It would also be helpful if one could specify the interval
between decades, i.e., how many decades to label. Plotting
10ˆ6-10ˆ4ˆ6 gets messy with 41 powers of 10 being written.
Doing the equivalent of a regular label where the labeling
interval can be set is much more useful.

Try using the asterisk in your code. Such as:

will not do the jump to zonk because the line is not
condensed. Furthermore, if you forgot to even write unit
zonk, that line will not even produce the message, "unit

Cute Walton, except that if extensive debug is used

Now then, if you could
change stop to *stop
and put that in while you do NOT want debug, the debug
stuff being surrounded with *stop commands would not be 
condensed... now then, if you take the change command
out, the *stop's would become comments, and, voila!
debug!... I realize, however, that the change is done
after the piece of the lesson to be condensed is determined,
etc, but it is a good piece of dreaming.....

---------- note 344 print-outs
  04/24     11.58     myers       o

        Concerning Print-outs!!
Some people have had trouble finding their print-outs. The 
reason being that the print was put in the wrong box. Some 
of these print-outs had a message in the first block asking
for the print-out to be left in this or that printbox or to
be mailed to this or that address, and yet the print-out was
still put in the wrong mailbox. Some of these mistakes were
unmistakably the fault of the operator, however some of the 
messages were hard to see at a glance. To help the operator
determin where you want the print-out to go perhaps you
could seperate the message from the rest of the code:

********************
*
*leave prints in box b
*
********************

putting this at the top of block 'a' so that if couldn't be
missed. -continued in response-

---------- response 1
  04/24     12.09     myers       o

        If you still have trouble finding your print in the
correct box, try looking in the letter of the name with
which you requested the print. That is probably where it
is. If not, you can either re-request it or get in touch
with the operator on duty to see if she/he knows where it 
might be.
        Print-outs for records using initials are put in 
the box corresponding to the last initial. Sometimes a
name can be mistaken for initials, so check the other box.
It may be a hassle to use space in block 'a', but it will
probably help get your print-out to you.

Consider what happens when you have just condenesed
your lesson, immediately returned to author mode to 
correct your condense errors, and a backoff is attempted
by the system. When stop1 is 'pressed' the message
about limiting author's condensing is received, then
back is 'pressed' and you are back editing again.
The cycle repeats for 45 sec. or until the system gives
up. Of course this creats no real proble for authors
but it might speed up backoffs if this was corrected.
I just thought I would tell you that this condition
existed...

Since the system does not delete a lesson unless space

The PLATO computer truncates your shift count to the
least-significant 6 bits (so it is modulo 64). Therefore
if you shift 60 it is the same as 0, 61 the same as 1,
62 is 2, 63 is 3, but a shift of 64 is a shift of 0....
Hence as shift of 60 or 64 are both shifts of 0. A shift
of 65 is a shift of 1. ETC.

Keep in mind that it is a series of variables that determine

after much deliberation and experimentation, we've decided
it would be best for all concerned to just *bump* any
ACCESS-<CR>'s......and the like.......but this routine
WILL work for all half-spaces and half-backspaces......
be sure that j is defined as a V-VARIABLE!!!!

all the other things apply as in note ¬$ 397......
and _that_ unit works nicely if you never use the

Of course this one works well, too, and can be easily

search    (067$cls$54),1,var,jcount,1,n2,0 $$super

calc      v9?jcount-(n1+n2+n3+2?n4+n5+n6+n7?.5+n8?-.5)
**var is first variable containing string
v9 contains the number of character spaces from the
original starting position.
for shifted arrow stuff: (070xx$cls$48),2,etc with
xx=33 for 0,34 for 1,35 for 2,36 for 3,and 37 for 4

Instead of:

you could use:

search 'ˆ?',1,var,jcount,1,n1,0

Only problem is that a line can have sups and subs which
will screw up your calculation using *where*. One solution
would be to do the calculations from wherex, dividing
by 8:
   .
   .
at     0,496

return $$remember that a showa doesn't update *where* etc.

remember, pete, that your routine picks up the ACCESS
twice.......so you have to check whether you just picked
up one.......and two ACCESS's in a row cancel each other
out.........and you are going to look through the string
n times where n is the number of codes you want to pick
up.......where I go through just once!

true, but, for non-hacker type people, it is easier to
modify for special cases.
(although it does eat up more words.) (even though
access,access may cancel, it is still two characters that
have to be removed from the count. plato does not bump
them)

If you want to:
        1)Underline a response
        2)Write a cursor editor
        3)Have a note lesson that prevents a student from
          writing a line that won't fit in your display area
          but doesn't restrict him to half-length if he
          types in shifted chars
        4)And you can't TELL me you haven't noticed all the

---------- response 2
  04/26     12.42     jhw       speech

At least in phonetics, we find it very helpful in judging
a student's response: there is a much closer correspondence
between the number of characters appearing and the units
we want to teach in than that afforded by the number of
6-bit codes necessary to generate them. Basic things such
as "you have transcribed too many symbols" and also more
exotic symbol by symbol judging routines could benefit.
Mr. Ariew originally raised the question regarding use
with languages. If this information is in fact not
available to the system (which seems hard for us lay-people
to believe), the systems implementation of a routine similar
to these would be much better than nothing. --jim wilson

---------- response 3
  04/26     13.20     jhw       speech

There is another question here as well. When a student
is typing in a force micro, it would be valuable to know
the number of keys the student thinks he has pressed.
A problem is whether to treat a shifted key as one or
two (i'd prefer one.) Perhaps a string of the onmicroed
keys could be returned. At any rate, if something along
these lines is not difficult, it would solve for us some
problems that -charcnt- wouldn't, although there are still
some that -charcnt- would solve and this would not. --jim

Pete Rowell's: worked sometimes.....but ran at an average of
        4.2 msecs with all those searches.

Mine: all attempts short of ACCESS-<CR> returned the 
        correct value of *charcnt*, and ran at no more
        than 1 msec total.....(some of the trials
        I had to throw out because the time was recorded
        as 0.000 msecs, due to Cyber clock limit)

My routine can be further optimised by taking out the
checks for length longer than *maxchar*.......but I
can't seem to record a time for that one....too fast.

This is the sequence of events:

I wanted to add onto my 1-block common in the middle

block number and copied a source block. I went into the
source block, D300, and backed out of the block.
I then copied the common block to the end of the lesson
but didn't check to see if it was correct. I deleted
the original copy of the common then added another
common block with the same name as the first common
block, changed the reference to 644 words, and pressed
stop1. It acted rather strangely, so I looked at the common 
I'd copied, and lo and behold, it was a copy of the
source block I'd originally copied' but it had the
name of the common I7d copied and it was common.

I think it is not desirable..... even for only 1 or 2 chars

Think of the hundreds of times each day it would have to
be printed.  Then if you pressed the space bar for "more"
the symbol would have to be erased, using more logic, a
another address, another write, and 2 changes of mode.

All efforts are being directed towards minimizing the load
on the editor.

Judy:
I mean an end list to show when the space bar will not
display any more lines of code...at the end of the block.
As it works now (especially during periods of heavy system
use) I am never sure if there is more code in a block.
I certainly don't want to see a heavier load on the system..
but all those extra presses of the space bar must use
up some computer time.

It would be nice to have some sort of system defined

presently are in in a join sequence. When one is doing
recursion on plato, keeping a pointer is sometimes tricky
and what you think your depth is may not be the number that
the system does (which in all cases is more important than
your idea, since it would save a lot of execution errors)

so plato can keep track of the join depth and have some
basis for the execution error.... comments?

 That is a wonderful idea. Is that possible wmg ?
If an author could volunteer his services to people
in his course ( or in other courses for that matter )
the demand upon the "weekend consultants" would be
drained by the interested authors. I have a good many
of student authors paging me during the weekends and
since some of them are not in my course, I can not
monitor them to see what their problems are, If we
( volunteering authors ) could be allowed to enter
lesson -consult- then we could _see_ where their pro-
blems are and therefore we could help them more effect-
ively. Please page me sometime when you are free (wmg).

What about having a quoted string notation in which the
various subs,sups,brackets,delimiters etc would all have
a "displayable" equivalent such as their own graphic in the
case of brackets and arrows in the case of subs,sups etc.
example: "[H==¬X2¬WSO¬X4¬W]" or something like that. Condensor
could code this some way inside machine and interpreter
could be keyed by a special command to scan and convert
student response using the same technique. The visible
characters could then be compared by existing commands
to the visible characters in the author correct response
with whatever meaning appropriate for a mismatch added by
the author. While it is true that puts etc. are necessary
to handle describable character strings, and they are
sometimes awkward, that is an entirely different problem.

---------- note 464 lock shift

Is there any possibility of a locking "shift" like a locking
super or sub but for CAPS and other things with shift codes.
Such a feature would seemingly save a good deal of
transmission time not to mention disk space and ECS when
LOTS OF= CAPITOLS ARE USED IN WRITE COMMANDS. Perhaps a
-mode shift- or -force shift- would be the thing,
Does such a feature exist already?

---------- response 1
  04/28     09.52     slaughter       css

Computer Science lessons currently use a micro table to
accomplish this end, but the feature suggested would be
welcome.

---------- response 2
  04/29     13.12     judy       pso

A "force capitals" would have to be different in its
implementation than the "lock superscript" or "font".
It seems an unlikely feature.

When you are typing along and want to do a locked super-
script, you type:
       this is (shift-SUP) up
The locked-sup code (07066) is only entered into the
character string as you type it. There are no "generated"
codes. The above string looks like this:

      024  10  11  23  55  11  23  55   70  66  55  25  20
       t    h  i   s   sp  i   s   sp  lk-sup   sp  u   p

 however to take the typed string "this is" and change it
to all capitals it would be necessary to generate a shift
code (070) and insert it before each letter:
you type: 024 10 11 23 55  11  23 
machine has to make:
     070  24  70  10  70  11 70  23  70  55  70  11  70  23

  The typographers tell us that people read small letters
better [faster] because they are used to reading them.  For
this reason the trend in journalism is toward headlines
which contain both upper and lower case letters.
  Maybe the CS people could take their cue from the
typographers. I realize that the default (only) character
set that most teletype terminals have is upper case, and
that these are the kind of terminals that most CS authors
are familiar with. But these are weak arguments for using
upper case characters in simulated programming on PLATO IV.
One could say that lower case letters are the default case
on PLATO IV. just as they are in the printed English
language.
  I might add that the PLATO IV system staff does its
programming in lower case letters, and there is certainly
less adaptation than in trying to read slashed O's.

I would tend to agree that writing in this manner is easier
to read.  However, the applications I have in mind are
labels and items I wish to EMPHASIS or have STAND OUT from
the rest.  If my charset weren't full I might us italics
or some such thing and in some cases _underlining_ might be
good enough but there are many cases where I want CAPPED
-force   capitals- should be available.  Since a SHIFTED
SHIFT is nonsense and since all other shifted keys would
seem to have valid functions already the -force- idea would
be the thing.

Just to satisfy my curiosity, does it take one or two
characters to transmit a SHIFTED CHARACTER (Two isn't it).

---------- response 5
  04/29     23.37     s gooch       p

   Unfortunately, your question has no simple answer.
The number of characters that it takes to transmit a
character from the "PLATO computer" to the terminal is
dependent upon whether or not you must switch character
memories.
    	This is further complicated by the fact that the
contents of the read only character memories in the "old"
style terminals are not the same as the contents of the
"new" style terminals.
   Perhaps there should be a write-up in aids to explain
where the terminal gets the characters that it plots.
(Perhaps there is one, already, but if there is, I can't
find it.)
  If you would like to find out the exact details of how
the characters are transmitted and plotted, you can read

Running some tests on old and new terminals it seemed
to put up CAPS slower on both. This may be a psycological
effect I suppose, but my guess is that it is taking two
characters. Of course my suggestion would not cut this
unless there is a way to fix the terminal to go into a
shift mode and then punctuation would probably be messed up.
Or well.

Just looking in AIDS I ran across the fact that a shift
code (070) is given by shift-?. So how about 07070 being
a locking shift. Hadn't realized it was on the keyset or
I would have suggested it sooner.

---------- response 1
  04/29     00.36     blomme       s

  It DOES echo all codes! The "2" in "200" is the bit
which is set telling us that the key input is an echo'd
key. It just happens that the functional keys already
have this bit set in their internal representation in
TUTOR, so that when you "echo" them they appear to come
back unchanged...in point of fact, the key number sent
from the terminal contains only 7 bits, with an additional 
bit set if it is an echo key (and only last 7 bits of
the number you give are used to specify the key to echo).

   I would not depend upon having the echo command

use is in a system determination of "liveness" of a
terminal, and most uses by an author can or should be
handled via press; for these reasons we may make the
echo command unavailable to authors in the future or
restrict its use to a greater extent.

Why does the -match- command recognize  "control"

The -match- comand does not recognize the two as
synonyms. It does, however, do something that you are
probably not aware of. For example this match command:

match n1,zero,connecting rod,control,four

will return: 0 for student input 'zero'
              1 for    "    "   'connecting'
              2 for    "    "   'rod'
              3 for    "    "   'control',
         and  4 for    "    "   'four'.
   Note that "connecting" and "rod" are treated as two
different words.  This may have caused confusion which
which led you to believe that the -match- command was
treating "control" and "connecting rod"  as synonyms.
   In the future it might be quicker for you write a
short section of code to test your hypothesis, rather than
having to wait for us to answer notes.

my match command had NO spaces in the tags. The problem

   The specs okspell is what is causing your problem.
Unfortunately, the TUTOR speller thinks that control is
a misspelling closer to connectingrod than oilcontrolrings.
I think that you will agree that it is pretty far from
either one.
   There are a number of ways to solve your problem. One
way would be to simply remove the okspell from the tag of
the specs command. Or, if you want the student to be able
to type "control!, you might add "control" to the tag of
the match command.
   Please excuse me for misinterpreting your problem. I
certainly didn't mean to imply that you were wasting my
time, but you must admit that you would have probably been
able to trace this problem down in less than the 27+ hours
that you had to wait to get the answer this way.

How finicky do you have to be with the wording of the
student's answer? Perhaps you could allow _either_
connecting or rod, either control or rings:

match n1,connecting,rod,control,rings,pins
join n1,nope,drawrod,drawrod,drawring,drawring,drawpin

-match- just picks one word out of the student's answer
so it wouldn't care if the student put both connecting
and rod.....either one would do.

The -use- command does interact strangely with -stop- and

The -use- command is very expensive in disk accesses, ECS
buffer space, and condense time -- it is not very likely
that nested -use- commands will ever be permitted

then 2 lessons).

Paul Tenczar, Axel Schreiner, Jim McKeown, and I had a
long discussion Tuesday about the recent restriction that
a routed student cannot successfully execute a jumpout
to a router-type lesson other than his own router.?
Our objection is that many routers contain the index to
their course's lessons, and some, at least, are agreeable
to allowing that index to be used by others. Of course,
the router has to be careful how it uses nr and vr variables
in order to work correctly.?
Paul stated that the restriction was put in to protect
routers which don't anticipate being executed as ordinary
lessons; some such routers have been having trouble from
being executed in that manner, with the result that nr ¬+
vr variables have unpredictable values.?
(continued--press -lab-)

---------- response 1
  05/02     11.07     friedman       csa

(continued)?
We. pointed out that a router which wants to protect itself
from use as an ordinary lesson need only code in its ieu:
jumpout router='name';x;q
where "name" is the router's lesson name.?
Paul suggested a new command which could be executed by
a router lesson which would, in effect, say "Ok to execute
me as an ordinary lesson". All other routers would be
protected from being executed, either by authors or by
non-routed students.?
The purpose of this note is to find out what other users
think about this problem.

I think that if nr and vr variables are not read for authors
and multiple users, that by-passes are easily constructed to
handle their presence in the lesson.

I for one would like to open all of our lessons to the system
in the very near future and this sort of thing reduces the
need for repetative programming of a new index and saves
on file space.

     I have no use for this feature at the moment because I
tentatively plan to route all courses at our site via one
(big) router in order to incorperate the economies of scale.
But I forsee that it will be necessary when we begin to
route students to router lessons produced at other schools
such as UIMC or Stan's chemistry routers. I think the
feature will be necessary at that time. It will become an
absolute necessity if and when someone gets it in his head
to put a size restriction on the size of router lessons,
which is (although not now anticipated) highly likely.
     My router, however, can be used by authors because
it uses student variables only. And it swaps a subset of
those student variables with router variables on entry and
exit (in the case of the student). I don't know if that
will mess up students from other courses or not; if so,
I can quickly adjust for it.

Another vote for this feature at course tutoring.
Since our router is a regular lesson implemented as a
router to control restarts, rather than to use
as a general control for students, and since it is
expected to be listed in sample soon, I strongly
support this change.

Note; I realize that this is a very poor use for a router.
If you want me to change it, I gladly will, but I'll
need another 2-part lesson to move the academic
materials to! (The present router can then be reduced
to one-part)

---------- response 7

Personally, I feel that jumpouts to routers (as ordinary
lessons) ought to be allowed, as formerly. Let the person
who wants to protect his router protect it; it takes only
one line of code, in the ieu (see 1st response).

We need something like a system-defined group called "touch"

and would let a touch ( any touch ) break that pause.

We are putting lessons on a router, and 'imain'-ing what
some keys will do ( the imained unit is in the use block ).

Trying to change a half-dozen lessons now on pause ( blank )
loops will cost time, debugging, and maybe the flexibility
(since the number of keys and where they go are certain to
change ),
and will certainly defeat our purpose for using the imain.

We don't need anything fancier than the ability to break the
pause with a touch ( no other group possibilities or
additions to keytype ).

---------- response 4

The group called -ext- is the important thing.
As I understand it, currently, execution of an
-echo- leading to a keys-type -pause- may give
unpredictable results if the -echo-ed key is
not a function key. All I am suggesting is a
reliable way to get past the keys-type -pause-
in such circumstances. The group -ext- is the 
important thing, because then a keytype command
ould distinguish between external inputs and keyset
(or pseudo-keyset) keys, for branching to external
control routines. For instance,
pause  5,keys=ext,next,back,alpha
keytype n1,ext,next,back,alpha
jump    n1,null,device,unext,uback,uletter

shows  (123456789012)           gives  12.35?10?ˆ10??

My first guess would have been the exponent form in all 
three cases.

Will it be possible to skip specifying a format and still

Second argument of shows is explained in aids as an
estimate of the number of significant digits desired.
If this estimate is exceeded by too much (about 5 extra
digits to left of decimal), exponential notation is used.?
Now to the meat of the matter: How about making the default
on shows nozero; that is to get a reasonable sized number
shown with no leading or trailing zeros, all we need do is:?
shows number?
I suggest this because I believe that this is the most
likley use of shows.?
Thank you.

That, as Mckeown says, is the meat of the matter--and that
is what we would  like to do. I still regard this scheme
as amenable to change, however--and did not want to destroy
existing lessons depending on all those trailing zeroes...

Judy: Remember 8+4=12 digits (see aids); and we do intend
that "nozero" become the default argument. The "null"
second argument you ask for would often be nice--but is
not easy to accomplish.

Ruth: After you get switched to exponential format, you
cannot have the (now embedded) zeroes suppressed. Sorry.
The idea is one of showing you _something_ (thank you Judy)
--it would be rather high overhead to handle that case,
with not very many returns.
And yes, the action of third argument is currently backwards
!!!--Thanks, Ruth (so I was a little sleepy).

Corrected current PLATO to work as advertized--thanks for
noting the inversion, Ruth.

A general comment--it is apparent that the default arguments
on -shows- work well, as even Judy had not used the 2nd
argument before (!)--aids now has a reasonable description
of the 2nd argument (yes, Charlene thought it was
indescribably (delicious?) too)--but the basic idea is
that in order to show _something_ when the given format does
not fit, you are shown up to four extra digits before
being shown an exponential form (thus, you do not get
branched to exp. form until it takes up less space on
your screen).

Thank you for the explanation, Bob (and thanks for the

-shows- should omit trailing zeros.  Now that -showe- does
not write 10ˆ0 (thanks again!) this is the most useful way
to show a number with the correct number of significant
digits; for ordinary "show somethings" the zeros are a 
nuisance.

Remember, if you have 6 letters plus an underscore, then
that is 8 characters (underscore is 07041= shiftcode, 6).
The 7th character then would be a shiftcode which does not
show up in display.

specs alphxnum
match return,There's,an,any,riot

There are several problems here. The worst problem is
that the condensing of the -match- command should give 
you some info to tell you that there is a problem!

The word "There's" is being taken by the -match- command
as three (!) words: 1) There followed by a shift code;
2) the number 7; 3) and the letter s. An apostrophe is
actually a shift code followed by a 7, and your alphxnum
is taken both during condensing and execution to mean
that a number following a letter is a word boundary, while
a letter following a number is always a word boundary.
So (There-shiftcode)(7)(s) is three words! On top of this
mess, the -match- command apparently does not require
commas as separators!

Clearly, there is some work needed here........

---------- response 2
  05/05     09.32     judy       pso

Odd indeed, but consistent (even documented!) if you know
the exotic byways.....

-specs alphxnum- is causing the apparent inconsistency.
  -specs alphxnum- instructs the computer to regard
_every_ letter/number boundary as a word boundary.
I.e., ab34cd75 is regarded as 4 words.

In the internal coding (found in student response buffer)
of the word "There's" the apostrophe (') is represented
as o7042 (shiftcode, 7). So the word is thus:
  t h e r e shiftcode 7 s
You can see that there is a letter/number boundary between
the e/7 and another letter/number boundary between 7/s.
Instead of being 1 word, "There's" is counted as 3 words!

I can answer some of your questions semi-authoritatively.
But I would welcome a ***system response*** to the others. 
Answer to 1;
A -jump- is preferred. It is a little slower than a
-goto-, but it doesn't involve an extra command, and it
eliminates certain judging variables which are otherwise
"preserved" over a timeslice and can drive you _crazy_ when
the next arrow comes up.
answer to 2;
It is always better to use -branch- if you can! Branch
is both faster and smaller than -goto-.
Answer to 3;
Teh -exti- command can have a numeric tag which is evaluated
at execution time. If the value is -1, the -exit- exits all 
levels of -do- at once. If it is zero, no exit is done.
If it is greater than zero, exactly that many levels are
executed. Examples;
exit  2 $$ exits from 2 levels
exit  n1=1 $$ exits from all levels if n1=1
exit  0 $$ does nothing

---------- response 2
  05/06     07.36     fumento       oldedit 

   The -exit- command will allow exit from a -do- or a
-join-, but will not allow exit from a -doto- loop.

---------- response 3
  05/06     11.27     b sherwood       s

I would say something like this: If you have enormous
amounts of processing to do, which implies looping, then
you must worry about how best to optimize the innermost
loop. Presumably that loop must be written with -branch-
or -doto-.





On the other hand, if you are not in such straits, it is 
far preferable to write simply.  For example, use the 
-next- command to specify the next main unit, rather than

pause 
inhibit erase
entry   zap
erase
jump    blah

This kind of writing is quite common, perhaps in part
because we have not yet attempted to teach good style
in writing TUTOR code.

-------------response 4
  05/06     11.41     b sherwood       s

Good style in writing TUTOR consists in part of using
-do- liberally to modularize and isolate the basic
subroutines from the main flow of the program.  Also, let 
the " main" units further delimit the structure of the 
program.  It _is_ possible (unfortunately) to write a
program with only one main unit, replete with -entry-,
-goto-, -erase-, etc., etc. Such programs are horrors to 
read!

There has been much discussion about the possible lowering
of the cpu limit from its present value of 10 ms/sec.
The average cpu use by students is in fact less than
2 ms/sec, but we have been worried that lessons running
at 10 might "hog" the machine, causing delays for students
in normal courses. It is proposed that within the next
few weeks we lower the limit to 7 ms/sec. Recent
improvements in the system should make such a reduction
cause little interference in PLATO teaching. You would
also probably see little effect on editing.

Ultimately it is possible that the limit might go as
low as 5 ms/sec. We would want to see the effect of
a 7 ms/sec ceiling before making such a further reduction.

Bruce: I still have not got all of the lessons repaired 
from the last change! Lessons which averaged 1 ms/sec with 
a full class of students simply do not run on the current
limit because they require ca 10 ms/sec to calculate and
plot some displays but balance this off with sections
which require little cpu. The last change seemed to
decrease the time over which the cpu limit was calculated.
If the cpu limit is lowered again, could some further
consideration be given to the average question. It seems
that a lesson which in fact runs at 1ms/sec should not
have to be rewritten everytime the cpu limit is lowered.

It was my understanding...from many years back..that
the system would permit lessons which had moderate 
swings in cpu usage as long as the average over a
reasonable section of the lesson was low.

(1) I do not like the idea of reducing cpulim.
(2) We simply may not have any choice if we are going to
double the number of people using the system... indeed
such a change made now would anticipate a coming situation
in the fall where the system might be almost unusable
for everyone--making the change now (or during the summer)
would hopefully eliminate the necessity for changes during
critical times of high student usage in the fall semester.

There are a few (like 1 or 2 or 3) touchy terminals which
have been specifically marked by the maintenance people as
"do not turn off".

At Parkland we sometimes have turn-on problems, but it is
related to the phone lines. In those cases repeated presses
of red button, white button, back, next, etc. eventually
get the phone line synchronized.

Many terminals, especially the new ones, are very hard
to get to come on after being off over night. Several
attempts with a bright light right next to the screen
is essentially standard practice. Some days it is 
simply not possible to get all of the terminals to
come on even using such techniques.

I think that perhaps this should instead be flagged as a
condense error. Starting a continued line with a comma
gives condense errors for other conditional commands:
jump,do,join,next. Starting a continued line of -writec-
with a comma makes sense, and is legal.

Doesn't that 2nd calcs mean that no calc is to be done

yes Judy, no doubt that condense error or warning is best.
but as we both know this will take a while, meanwhile
since there is room in the end of the writeup of -calcs-
this will be a proper thing to do.

Friedman, there is no "empty" tag field in the second

Why is it that no amount of editing can change a common
block once it has been loaded into ECS. I know that the
editor changes the disk copy but until the ECS space is
needed the old copy stays in common and is used if it is
called in a common statement. Why can't you void the
copy in ECS if it has null usgae count and the editor
touches its disk copy (via DATA1 or HELP1 for example).
Its a pain to either change the common name each time its
modified or wait till the ECS copy goes away (that time
being a fuction of system load). Of course if you like
nice non-deterministic time and load varying results from
your lessons its a step in the right direction! This
multiple copy problem is commonly solved in large systems,
is there any reason you can't?

I'm not sure I made myself clear. The common that gets used
is not the latest copy. For example lesson trw4 paws its 
way through a common to produce a table in the last block
of that common. I want the table so I can't abort it. But
if later I make changes to the common and rerun trw4 the
system cleaverly picks up the old copy still in ECS (saves
disk access I assume) which does not have the changes.
Then trw4 uses the old common, none of the changes gets made
and finally the old copy is written out to kill the new one
on the disk" I really want either a -forceload- option in
the common statement to insure I get the latest copy or a
fix to the multiple copy problem itself. How does _abort_
help me any? If it does the aids writeup doesn't say.

You can return the common (if there are no students in it)
at any time you want simply by typing "common" on the
STUDENT MODE page. This insures that the latest copy of the
common is already on file in the disk. By aborting common
inside the lesson, then rturning it from the "student mode"
page, you can control returns yourself.

---------- response 6
  05/07     13.39     rowell       m

there seems to be some confusion here.
unless you are creating new commons in your lesson space,
the most up-to-date version IS in ECS and that is why that
copy is used, if possible. using the common returning option
from the student mode page causes a copy of the current
ECS copy to be written onto disk, but does NOT purge it 
from ECS.
if you are destroying your common in the editor, and then 
creating a new one, it is suggested that you rename it.

in referring to "the editor", are you referring to the 
"viewer" in the system lesson "edit" or to some student 
mode "common editor"?
in the case of the first, you can not change anything with 
it. in the case of the latter, if you wrote it properly, it 
should perform as expected, working on the ECS copy. if you
want to immediately rush back to your lesson to inspect the 
disk copy, i suggest you return a copy first.

Got all that straight?

1) Editing a common other than from a common editor lesson 
will cause some hassle. (Switching from common to source
and back.)

2) You can always reenter your lesson (assuming you are 
editing common, and the only person using the common)--
when you left the first time, the number of users of your
common dropped to zero, and the common was returned to disk;
when you reenter you can -term- to a unit with an -abort
common- command, and that ecs copy of common will not be
picked up again by any lesson, nor returned to disk.

3) If you are not the only person using your lesson, don't
try to edit it other than with a common editor!

  05/08     12.35     milner       css

The last response is a correct statement of what I want.
One more time, here is the problem.
1) I enter some codes in a group of blocks (source)
2) I add an empty block with the same name at the end.
3) All blocks converted to common.
4) This common is pawed over by a lesson which builds 
   tables in the empty last block.
5) Reconvert the common to source.
6) Rename the last block.
7) Convert the renamed block and three others after it 
   to common.
8) This second common is used read only======_=__=_ __=_ ____ by another lesson
   as control data.

If the second lesson does not work corrections must be made
to the first group of source/common blocks, the first lesson 
rerun, and second common rebuilt, then the second lesson
rerun. This cycle repeats as more bugs are found. I have
to cycle through renaming both commons, plus changing the
names in the lesso

   It is quite likely that we will provide an option to 
"purge" the ECS copy of a common in addition to the current 
option to return it to disk.
   It is important that the "usual" author understand that
the latest copy of his common is ALWAYS used (and it
oftentimes happens that a disk access is not needed to 
get it because a copy is in ECS). The manipulations
you are doing converting back and forth between common
and source are in fact quite specialized and are the 
real source of the problems here...exactly what approach
we will take in the future to such uses and what further
aids we might provide (if any) in these cases is unknown
at this time.
   As has already been said, it IS planned to provide
a real editor for common--but this may not be of any
help to you in the things you are doing.

Students are as frustrated by system reloads as by crashes,
since in either case they spend a long time sitting at a
terminal and waiting. In addition to the actual down time,
a student can be forced to wait 5 minutes or longer while
the router is condensed and then the jumped-out-to lesson
is condensed. (Particularly nerve-wracking is the crash
which occurs 10 minutes after a system reload!) Especially
during this period of instability when crashes are rather
frequent, it would be very helpful to those of us running
classes if system reloads could be avoided.

Does a system reload overwrite everything in ECS?

If it doesn't how about saveing the currently condensed
lessons (and all the info needed by the system to run them)
for a minute after system reload....Many of the students
who are bumped by a reload will go back to the same lessons.
If the system saved the info needed to get students back
into there lessons without useing the condensor, you
would surely cut down on their frustration,and the 
condensor's initial load.

The lack of -touch- as an argument for

Did you know that:   (hold tight)

1) Make a character set and put something on access-a.
Remember, access-a is abbreviated with (a).

2) When typing press FONT to shift into the FONT character
set. Then type access-0 (shift-square, 0). What you will
get is the character stored on (a), automatically back-
spaced one space. Got that?

Works ONLY in the FONT character set, for (0) through (9)  
producing (a)-(j) automatically backspaced 1 space.

   This print as currently implemented (or proposed
to be implemented) is a simple print of the common (or
dataset file) as alphanumeric text. Certain symbols, when
put in column 1, will permit you to specify a page eject
and the end of printing as well.
   Perhaps Doug Brown can clarify the current status of
these items (I had the impression they were done but not
written up in printaids yet).

Seriously, Al, system reliability is a very important 
question, and a sensitive one at the moment. Asking
whether it would take one, two, or five system crashes
before we would abandon plans to run 100 hours of classes
is hardly the point. Obviously most of us are deeply
committed to running classes on plato, and spend many
often agonizing hours trying to do so despite system
problems. There is not much one can say in three short lines
of comments about the impact of system failures on
classes, student attitudes toward plato, student attendance,
or anything else relevant. The question of how reliable 
the system must become in order to make plato classes a
viable teaching tool is certainly an important one, but 
your questions and choices for answers available do not 
allow any meaningful responses.

I realize that any attempt to collect data in a multiple

that can be transferred. The intention was to gather
data from authors while minimally disrupting their work.
I am certainly open to more lengthy inputs from anyone
who wants to make the effort. All inputs are more than
welcome.
We now have data on the actual reliability of the 
system for several months (i.e. the probability of a
crash in one class hour, mean duration of failures, etc.)
We know that current performance is inadequate, the 
question is, "how far do we have to improve before every 
one gets up and leaves"

The grafpack commands all seem to truncate instead of

type commands as illustrated by:

at     100.6,100

locate 100.6,100
write  a

Nor is it consistent with the non-integer to integer 
conversion that is done in other circumstances (eg. n1?v1,
or the first tag of a conditional statement).

It's as if the origin were located at the bottom of the

MULTICS has such a feature (help crashes) which is useful

prior announcement of major system changes be made,
with reasons (like "fix the 4:30 crash bug") and logged

There seems to be some weirdness somewhere.
If one trys to

charset cslibrary,keytops

the condensor 1) flags it as a ambiguous expression;
              2) and, adding injury to insult, gives
                 notice of a variable error, thus ignoring
                 the whole thing....

In fact, the charset command is tossed out if just
"keyt" is used. "key" gives the ambiguous warning
(understandably) but one has to add the "t" to get the 
fatal-type error (fatal for the charset, at least).

I suppose the system is relating this to keytype?
In any event, it's a bit odd. Easy to fix, though, I
assume.

  05/10     09.16     little t       phys

Would it be possible to allow lessons to have
both permanant and temporary common at the same time?
It would seem that the lesson should contain a common
command with just a numerical tag to tell the length of 
the entire common and then another one which would specify
the posistion of the permanant common on disk. Then when
common is returned, only the permanant common would be
written to disk. As far as comloads and such, they would 
be handled just as before. This would be a great aid to
lessons that need some type of permanant common for records
and a lot of temporary common for running the lesson. This
would save a fair amount of disk space also, at the cost
of a little more flag checking.

I have modfied a previous lesson that determines the

If I recall in lesson "evaluate" you have to manually
count up the number of words and sentences and so forth.
The lesson which I recoded (file name= pirl) lets you
simply type in the material to be evaluated. When you
press -NEXT-, PLATO counts all the words, and their length
and the number of sentences and a few other things.
To me this is much easier than in lesson evaluate.

I'd like to be able to declare an area "incomplete"...
In one of my lessons, students can return to the index from
any point in the lesson; as long as they remain in the
lesson, though, all areas are tagged "complete" since sooner
or later another area command is encountered.
Would something like an -area incomplete- tag be
possible?

Another vote. And how about an
area complete
tag, too, to prevent an area from being tagged as
"incomplete" when a jumpout is performed to another
lesson / i.e. after the final exam in the mastery lessons?
The area is done as far as meaningful questions, or any
arrows at all, are concerned, yet it is tagged as
"incomplete" whenever the -jumpout- is encountered.

  I have always liked notes and I find it very interesting,
but I also have something to add about it.Wouldn't it be
GREAT if there was a section in notes that could be used
to write a private note to another author.It could made
so that when an author entered notes that it would
tell him/her , somehow that there was a note for him.
It should also tell the author who it is written from.
  This would be fantastic because if an author that is
sharing a lesson with another author wants to give the
other author a message about the lesson , then it would
leave it for him in notes.
  This way,no author who is not supposed to read the note
would not be able to enter it.This should also be made so
that single or multiple amount of authors could use it.
       Please, everyone respond to this note with your
ideas and especially system programmers.

on lesson yes, i never put an inspect on my lesson but
on courses (ie css) well youll be surprised that many
newly created courses, they put 10 names there letting
the author select his own password, very often it is long
before the author do that, when you inspect the file it says
password not chosen yet, you can enter under that name
and get right into the system as an author......
the point here that there cannot be any possible use for
an author to inspect different files (not his own).

css DOES have an inspect code, as do all course files
used by CS. Also, I never enter an author or student
signon without giving it a password, so that people
who "explore" to "capture" a signon cannot conveniently
capture one of ours.

Sorry you were unable to work. Several people who
refused to take a hint about the restrictions on game
playing in 203 ERL now have new passwords on their records.
We intensely dislike having to do things like this but
the terminals at ERL are heavily used by people who must
work nights and early mornings to prepare lessons for
classes. Off hours are often the only times that these
authors can test large lessons. Large numbers of
vacant terminals thus do not necessarily mean that the
site is not being usefully utilized. Note that this
policy extends only to the second floor rooms of ERL.
All other sites are free to adopt any policy on games
which meets their own interests. Al Avner

---------- response 3
  05/12     19.25     milner       css

Thanks for your help but you missed the main point. Why
don't you control access? Can't you classify the well
known games like conquest as games and delete them when
ECS fills up. At least then the hackers would need as
much willpower as the serious author needs now. Running
as students they won't get thrown out like authors do
when they bounce back and forth from editing to testing.
As a side point does the charset loaded in the terminal
get named before or after it is loaded? If I get deleted
while loading my charset does PLATO think it is loaded
the next time I try?

---------- response 4
  05/12     20.17     blomme       s

   Access is controlled in many ways: the system is
designed to run students and they have first priority.
Authors editing and testing short (1000 words or less)
lessons have next priority. Authors attempting to test
larger lessons are after that. All these priorities are
enforced on a local "logical" site (group of terminals
normally located close to each other) basis.
  If you can sign onto the system at all as an author,
you will be able to edit without interruption and also
able to test lesson segments that do not exceed 1000
words (also without interruption)--use the "partial"
condense technique to accomplish this.
   In general, God-like judgments by systems personnel
as to "good" or "important" lessons to be given special
preference over others are studiously avoided.

What is the sitenam value for 203b? I am currently

Note to game-players; This arrangement will simply warn
you if "muse" exceeds "mallot", but if a real excess
takes place, as in a crunch with several students trying
to enter at once, it will eventually delete. This will
cause howls, I know, but the present situation causes
even greater howls when authors and legit students
can't get into the lesson!

  05/13     01.16     kimble       css

Perhaps one step that could be taken on the systems level
would be along the lines that warner mentions...

It seems that there are a relatively few lessons that are
resulting in the abuse of the game-playing restrictions
in 203b...moonwar (7418 words!) and conquest come to mind.

The capability already exists on the system level to inhibit
particular lessons at particular sites.

So, perhaps that feature could be modified to inhibit the 
offending lessons only when ECS usage came to within (say)
5000 words of site allotment.

Obviously some trial and error would be necessary to decide
just what lessons should be included, and what ECS value
would be the critical point, but if such a modified
inhibition could be implemented, game players could still
play, which they do anyway, but only when the space
wasn't needed by lessons not on list the list.

---------- response 7
  05/13     08.32     avner       s

Unfortunately, blanket checks of any sort are unlikely to
be succesful. There are times (during certain scheduled
classes) when "game" lessons are legitimate parts of
class activities even at site 3 (room 203 and surroundings).
The objection is not to "game" lessons per se but to
recreational use of terminals and site ecs when others
have pressing needs for these resources. "Game" lessons
have a high visibility which has made them a convenient
target for the wrath of people who are unable to work
due to the selfishness of others. Al Avner

---------- response 8
  05/13     09.57     fumento       matha

        I think that the present ECS system should be
changed. At present it seems to favor the games on the
system. Only one student at any site on PLATO need sign
into a game like conquest, and then any author from any
other site on the system may sign into the game (no matter
what the site ECS is) and not have to worry about getting
deleted. I think that PLATO should press -STOP1- on an
author if the site ECS gets to big, regardless of whether
the lesson may be help in ECS because of a student at
another site or not.

Warner's solution is the fairest, most viable means of

god-like authority. "Game" lessons should have a site-
specific delete feature written into them by their owners,
and all my simulations will contain one; I urge the
cooperating authors of recreational lessons to do the
same: several of us may get together to create a -use-able

Say, that reminds me of something...

which allow free-form jumpouts to such trings as games?

        Obviously this type of thing will not go on for
ever ( i.e. obsolete jumpouts ), but it does seem rather
strange to me that these sign-ons exist!

        It was my understading that "student" records

these lessons, it is impossible to know if a secret term
exists which allows irresponsible jumpouts. I have been

No....the stop1 key acts like a stop key and falls through
the -charset- command to the -do- command. Unit second
is "done", and when the system sees that you are trying
to do a pause after a stop1 key has been pressed, it gives
you an execution error.

I don't want to pull you away from including touch on a
pause keys=, but we've still got this autobreak problem...

Here's some tests to describe it ( all as user type student,
recreated after each test, assigned to file 'sky2' ):
I. First, make sure there is a -backgnd- at the 
beginning. Then sign in, choose to look at the
library, choose to see program ¬$30 ("problems").
then press Next until it says Lab, then press Lab;
then go get a coke.
In my test, the cpu time was about 4.5-5.2 when I
pressed Lab; it climbed slowly, and was at 6.3 after
15 minutes, and at 6.4 after 30 minutes.
The display was flawless, and stop1 put "Press Next
to Begin" on the screen.

cont'd ---

---------- response 1
  05/12     23.03     dave       matha

II. Take the -backgnd- out, and start with a new record.
Same procedure, except you won't have much time for 
the coke:
In my tests, the cpu time climbed sharply; the first
error on the screen occurred when records showed
session time to be .02 to .03 hrs ( the lesson was
already condensed, for all tests ), and cpu reading
from 7.9 to 8.5. Notice that some of the output
doesn't appear ( e.g. the intermediate positions on
the turns ) but that all the calculations get done
( the plane's next postion is calc'ed from the 
previous one ).
IIa. If you sit and watch, the errors will come and go
for a minute or two, then the whole show will stop
dead ( apparently forever ) . However, the STOP key
will reactivate it, complete with errors.

 contd ---

---------- response 2
  05/12     23.40     dave       matha

IIb. If, however, you have tested the thing til you're
sick of it, and you press STOP1 right after the
first couple of errors instead of watching longer,
your display just stops ( no erasing , nor any
"Press Next to Begin" ); pressing Next gets
"Welcome to Plato". I repeated this test 3 times,
and got the same results each time.

I forgot to mention: the -backgnd-ed program runs
normally; the slight stops and starts are due to
different -delay- tags.
The STOP1 display error also happened while I was
user type author.
There is a .5 delay between commands, and most
errors look like Plato is skipping all the output
( but not the calculations )
between two successive -delay-'s of .5 (there is a
-delay- .15 between each puff of smoke).

A question about the conflicting behaviors of "notes"
and "edit" and a possible third way out for both
lessons;
Suppose you are in replace mode in "edit" and you
reach the end of the code you have written in a block.
You press -NEXT- and remain in replace mode. Blank
lines (or occasionally garbage) appear in the line
you are replacing, and the COPY key becomes inactive.
Now suppose you are in replace mode in "notes" and you
reach the end of the note. You press -NEXT- and are
immediately thrown out to the editor page!
A suggested compromise solution to this incompatibility;
When replacing in "notes" _or_ "edit", when you reach the
end of the block, the display changes and you find yourself
in insert mode. This could be done by a modification
of the present throw-out routine in "notes", and by a
checking of the space left in "edit".

I agree with those who ask for (demand) better controls
on game-playing in 203b, but my suggestion for a way of
making things a little more livable as far as ECS is
concerned is very simple: Allocate more ECS to site 3
during the late evening, early morning hours. Right now
there are 46 users on the system (18 in 203b) but because
only 44000+ words of ECS are allocated to this room,
students are having difficulty changing lessons and authors
are being deleted (I didn't believe it either, but it
happened.). Why can't more ECS be allocated to this
site where the usage is heavy even during the normal system
low-usage hours?

---------- response 1

  I believe that the ECS allocation for each site is

is done. I guess it is conceivable that a special
additional "something" might be done for 203b, but I
would not care to guess when/how.

False!  203b gets 34K during the day and only 44K during 
off hours.  Last time I went to school 2?34 was 68, not
44 (the PLATO supplied calculator confirms my result).
Any reason why we get the short end of the stick?  Do you
really hope to contain the game players by keeping 203b
ECS low and otherwise ignore your more basic design problem?

All sites get the same percentage increase in ecs after 
five. It would take a lot more than twich the present
allotment to satisfy teh game players and serious users
of room 203b. Unless you want us to start charging for 
use, I know of no effective solution to the problem other 
than all serious users working together to prohibit game
playing in that room. Most other sites have stringent 
access control, we want 203b to remain open to all
legitimate users.

      Note: computer science and accounting are the only
major users of PLATO who do not have a private PLATO
classroom in which they control access.
      I think one "free for all" site is a good thing,
but it shouldn't be the only recourse for some major users.

I would think that it would be entirely reasonable to 
expect that those sites which have heavier usage after 
five should get more than their share of the increase
in ECS. Further, an additional allocation at 10 or 11 pm
would help in 203b. (Several sites are locked up at about
that time.)?
(I don't contend that this will solve the problem, but it
will help!)

What is the system policy on smoking the evil weed in 
CERL 203b? I have heard whispers in the hallways that 
it was illegal. possibly even immoral, but some earnest

Currently, I have to double my intake of orange FANTA

We plan to introduce the following changes in the TUTOR
language next weekend:

Current      New name     Embedded form

show          showt         ¬0t,v1¬1
shows         show          ¬0s,v1¬1
(shows)       showz         ¬0z,v1¬1

The change of -show- to -showt- is to emphasize that this 
is the "tabular" show; the new -show- command will be
like the present -shows-, except that trailing zeroes will
be suppressed. All current -shows- commands will be
converted to the new -show-, which suppresses trailing
zeroes. For the few who need to actually display the
trailing zeroes, a new command -showz- will be added,
which will work just like the present -shows-...and 
display any trailing zeroes.

Example: (new) show v1 would give "23" instead of "23.00".

---------- response 1
  05/13     15.20     rader       s

NOTICE that the change from present -shows- to new -show-
_is_ a change in existing lessons. It is our guess, backed
up by having accidentally run for several days last week 
on a version of TUTOR which dropped trailing zeroes on
-shows-, that authors would in fact prefer this change.
No one mentioned in notes having noticed any adverse
effects (which is the reason this lasted for several days!).
So it seems you are happy with or prefer "23" to "23.00".

Please comment here if these changes would cause problems
for you. Our goal is to make the command name -show-
refer to the "nicest" of the -show- commands.

   I cannot conceive of what you describe happening
except perhaps if you happened to be in INSPECT ONLY
mode when designing your charset or exited from the
charset editor by pressing HELP1 (which does not return
characters to the disk).
   I assume that when you went to re-design your chars
you looked at the charset directory and did not find
the chars there that you had previously designed.
   It seems most likely that there is some misunderstanding
somewhere here that perhaps can be cleared up by talking
to a consultant.

I have written the deletion unit which I hope to include

including library. I would line controllers for each
logsite to decide for themselves the amount of leeway
that will be given to students playing games in their
logsites. This should be expressed as a number representing
the value of (muse-mallot) at which students should begin
to be deleted in order to make room for authors. These
people should then enter lesson 101, block g, "deletor"
and follow the instructions there to insert the amount
they wish to choose. As an example, should the controller
for a site ask for -500 words leeway, students running at
his site in deletor-requipped games will be deleted if
there are only 500 words of ECS _not_ used by his site. If he

It might be useful to have an inhibit erase-key function.
This would be particularly useful when a student gets

the student accidentally presses -erase- and then has
to retype his answer...in many cases the increment
counters get messed up.

Every possible effort is being made to repair or recover
the information in the damaged lessons. In most cases the
damage is in the directories, which means that the contents
of the lesson is intact, but the location and order is lost.
In these cases we will need your help in restructuring the
directories.

In the cases of damaged courses, the damage is usually in
the records of those students who were running when we
failed. These are best repaired by destroying those records
and recreating them. Course directors should try to make
those repairs. If the records contained important data,
let us know and we will try to recover some of it from
backup copies of the course after we finish working on
lessons.

Failures of the 844 disk controller were responsible for our

files. The controller stands between the computer and the
disk drives. All comunications between computer and disks go
through it.
This device had never failed in the many months since it was
installed. On Tuesday morning, it was turned off by a CDC
engineer so he could connect our newest disk drive. He was
unable to get it to come back on. Several hours later, it
was repaired and PLATO was working again. No files had
been damaged. At about 3:00, the controller failed again

To be specific...only files which were written to the
disk between 2:52 to 3:20 PM Wednesday have any possibility
of being partially destroyed. Instead of writing the proper
data to the disk, the disk controller substitued zeroes!
Approx. 150 files are involved...
1) the file directory and block -a- of any lesson changed
    by an author during that period.
2) any student, author, multiple, or instructor records
    used during that period could have been destroyed.
3) any common returned to disk during this period (this is
    perhaps the worst loss of data).
4) any personal notes files that had notes sent to them
    during the period.
5) any data files that had data sent to them during the
    period.
6) any block of datasets returned to disk during this

other AIDS lessons is among those which were clobbered.

Jim G. is working frantically trying to get it fixed.

---------- note 12 backup

           I have been curious for a couple of years about
the process of restoring from backup. I understand the pro-
cess of copying discs periodically, but have never seen
a description of how often updates are made and what
copies are available at any one time. Can someone enlighten
me on the frequency of backups being made and the length
of time they are kept?
Thanks.

More on this later...for now, the back_up for this
particular case is one week old...however, no back-ups
could help some of the loss of commons or student records
since the information in them was in the process of being
produced

At this point all files have been repaired to the extent
that we are able to repair them --- many files have blocks
that are zeroed where data was not recoverable but all
file directories should now be useable

Further restoration will require work by the author
involved -- blocks will have to be restored from back-up
copies or typed in again from print-outs

I will repeat my note about rcircle....
As was requested in a previous note, rcircle would be a
nice command to have. I have developed a 10 line unit that
will do all that is expected of it.... i.e. to match all
of the capablities of rdraw. A test unit has been devised
in lesson empires to test it. The code is available on
request via a personal note to dal of course ames.
        The use of this as a command will of course preclude
the fact that the systems personell must develop my code
into a command and also develop a new systems variable
-rotate- to pass the information of rotate to the command.
(or course they could do it without the rotate sys-var but
that var is one that should be available anyway)
        rcircle has the format of a standard 3 or 5 argument
circle command with the exception that the x and y values
are _relative_ to the systems variables wherex,wherey.

  Thursday afternoon the director of the cai lab here at
iowa city had me place a call to CERL to get an estimate
on when the system would be operational again.
  Upon waiting 16 rings the phone was 'answered'.
a garbled word or two (not hello or CERL) and then:
"find out if there is any hope for the system."
then a dial tone.
  The above words were as if a conversation had been
broken into: Not as if there was any attempt to
communicate.
  It is understandable that such things as disk malfunctions
are bound to occur occasionally: It is not that i would
be hung-up on.
  If this was an accident i appologize for bringing it up.
Its just that phone calls of this type are expensive.

It could be that someone here in the building meant to call
upstairs on the intercom line, failed to press the right
button on this phone, and intercepted your call. The garbled
words you heard were probably what he was saying to someone
else in the room.
When he didn't get a dial tone, he probably just hung
up, still not noticing he had intercepted a call.

333-2375 is the best number to use. Someone is always
(we hope) manning [personing?] that phone.

To systems person who works on answer markup:
  I am having problems understanding answer markup when
there is a carriage return in student response. Notice
below unit.
*
unit   huh
arrow  1010 
specs
at     3001
write  huh
answer dog cat
*
       Try "dog -cr- fox". Margin is off. I noticed that
replacing "at" with "draw 3001;3001" and it is ok. ?

---------- response 1
  11/16     22.31     tenczar       s

yes indeed...the problem here is that the -at- command
after the -specs- sets a margin that is different than
the margin "in force" at the arrow...the answer mark-up
routines must reset the -arrow-margin- before doing its
markup

also, many other things need improvement with answer
mark-up (like, counting hidden characters like the
shift code as real so get extra long mark-ups, e.g.:

  11/16     00.54     paulm       uimatha

        The -erase- command is often used in conjuction
with an -at-. Putting the two together in the same command
by adding one tag (or two if fine scale) specifying the
starting position would save space. Adding the tag at
the end of the -erase- would seem feasible since it would
not require changing existing -erase-'s, i.e.
erase 15,3;1720
would erase a 15?3 block of characters, starting at 1720.

I hope that it isn't too difficult to do this.

thanx,
paul mitchell

We do not (try not?) to subscribe to the idea that every
"neat" feature possible should be implemented...in the
case of adding "at" to "erase!, this really does not seem
to be an important addition to the language, and is likely
to make your (or others) programming less readable.
As to the "embedded -at- in -erase-" idea--the above reply
applies; with the more intense comment that this idea is
not even feasible.

---------- response 3
  11/17     21.57     pmateti       csa

i find it more useful to have an erase with a negative
tag meaning erase from r to l that many pos. _and_ set 'where'
accordingly.

---------- response 5
  11/18     14.08     donnelly       css

Just out of curiosity, is it feasible to make a conditional
tag for the erase command? I know this would have been of
help to me for cases where students have an option of
branching out of units with "inhibit erase" in them. It is
easy to get around not having such a command, but it might
be more obvious to somebody else reading my code (and maybe
even more efficient, since I have to do the conditional
erases in several places) if there was a regular command to
handle it.

Just a suggestion, not a complaint from a spoiled user.

i am not sure if this has come up before, but here it is
anyway:
*
*
do        unitname(x,45.6,7)
* at this point x would have the value (45.6?7)
*
unit      unitname( ,v2,v3)
calc      arg1?v2*v3 $$ some function

agr1 (or 2 or 3 or...) would be a dummy variable that would
be replaced by the variable that is in that position of
the calling command. in this case, x.
since i am not sure what method is used in the current
passing system, it is hard to tell what difficulties
might be encountered in implementing this. if it is, as
i suspect, a simple move to the receiving vars., then
i guess it would be rather messy.
in any case, it would be extremely nice to have.

---------- note 52 -store[n]-
  11/18     05.12     dave       infe

        I notice the following difference in the -store-
and -storen- commands:
        When there is no number available in the student
buffer (-store- will end judging), the tag of -store-
is not evaluated. The tag of -storen- is evaluated any time
it's executed. EXAMPLE:

   arrow  101         arrow   101
   calc   n1?0        calc    n1?0
   store  n(n1?n1+1)  storen  n(n1?n1+1)
   show   n1          show    n1

You'll get:
0                      1
       It would be especially nice if -storen- worked line -store- here!
       (For example, in storing indexed arrays of numbers thru -"label!,judge rejudge,storen,branch,ok,branch- ).
       Would it be (1) useful (2) feasible to bring
_storen_ into line? Thanks for listening.

This difference is quite useful (to me at least). It
makes processing of responses that may contain several
numbers. not all of which are always entered, possible
with relative ease. If both store operations behaved the
same, we would lose flexibility for minor gains in
simplicity. Perhaps more detailed documentation of the
differences would be in order rather than changes? Al

Al, I don't think he is asking for a change in what
-store- and -storen- do, just a change in whether the
tag is evaluated or not, so that his index does or doesn't
get incremented.

It turns out that if -storen- fails, it stores a zero
into the specified location (and or course updates the
index in his case). -store-, on the other hand, does
not store a zero if compilation fails, so that the
specified variable continues to have whatever value it
had, and the tag is not evaluated, and his index is not
incremented.

Now that we see this oversight, should -store- always
store a zero if the -store- fails?

Charlene,
        Sorry I haven't returned your call on this. I have
tried to check out the situation with our materials which
are being field tested for the first time this semester in
the community colleges. Too often these projects get
exposure before one has time to benefit from obvious first
round mistakes. I would like to know who is doing the
demos since that would make quite a bit of difference in
understanding the logic of the teaching. Also, how does
a buyer know he will not have the demonstrated lessons as
part of purchase? Are these materials ever used with
classes? What about data collection on their use? Besides
our project (NSF funded) there are individual authors of
english and math materials in the CURRICULAR GUIDE of T.

This note really belongs in personal notes but i think it's
fitting that after the effort which has just been expended
on HumRRO's behalf, everyone can see how much these efforts
are appreciated. We lost several weeks in a tight schedule
as a result of last weeks crash. Through the efforts of
the technical support staff in Illinois we have been spared
the task of trying to recreate a character set and its
associated programming. The response to our request and

Things of this sort tend to lighten things up around here

        This system is a tool for students, not a plaything

        It seems to me that the students must not
        really be enjoying the system the way they
        should if they are upset by such a display.
        Do they really like just grinding through
        the material, or have they never really
        been shown the capabilities of the system,
        and therefore don't expect such "just for

If you like it so much, put it in the AUTHOR MODE display.
and/or in the empty space at the right of the screen,
in "notes" and in _YOUR_ files, etc.
  What Mr. Marty was doing, was telling what HIS students
found annoying. So did mine. I personally like the mouse,
in fact i have a picture of him framed and autographed at
Disneyworld. But students at FLB (at least) are being
forced to and taught to utilize their time efficiently
because we not only have " the ecs crunch" but also get
transmission garbage from the microwave. Consequently, they
sign on fast and get "annoyed" if their name isn't accepted.
THAT is waht the original note was about, and I don't
think it called for any of the asinine irate responses it
got.

before. As I said before, maybe you are not utilizing
the potential of the system enough, and therefore the
students are surprised and frustrated by interesting
displays.
        Is it that rough for one or two days out of the

many other students enjoy the entry page?

  I think marty's idea is right in line with the IBM

at the top of the page. make it numbers instead. (faster)
lets go to the idea of linked lists for plato lesson lookup
and 19 level deep subroutine calls to do an add on the
machine level. Get rid of the draw command (please leave
in gbar). Make us records with numbers instead of names..
make response time with an upper limit of 3 minutes.
limit the number of plato terms on the system at one time
to 32. And most of all.. lets make money!

I find it striking that the three persons (risken,marty,

are all teachers who are responsible for running large
numbers of students. I also find it striking that all
of the authors of snide replies that I can identify are
NOT teachers responsible for running large numbers of
students.
        The crucial point which these replies overlook
is that Professor Marty is not merely registering an
opinion, but reporting some data and making a request
on the basis of that data. Replies that are based on

Gilpin, Avner, Siegel, and Steinberg:

  After looking over all of the responses I found that
the notes for the mickey mouse contained the same amount
of statistical evidence as did the notes opposed to
the little furry animal: 0
  Ah! perhaps the word students (notice the 's')
implies that at least 2 were disturbed.
Had there been some significant percentage of the
student population shown to disapprove I would have
been slower to write my, addmittedly, flipant reply.
  However it would seem that these notes contained
little significant data, thus most of the 'conversation'
contained little information value.
  When true data gathering is done to find the significance
on the teaching capabilities of PLATO that this char has,
I will leave it to the experts.

I will agree with the people from FLB that I am not an

a tremendous amount of time here running from site to
site trying to get on the system. As such, I saw an awful
lot of students at 203b and Physics today who did not seem
to mind the extra little hassle of the entry page at all.

I am sorry if your students didn't like the display. I am
upset, though, because it is complaints like this which
deprive other users of a lot of joy in using PLATO. (It was
calc" option on the entry page).

Incidentally, I not only saw many students who didn't mind
the display, but I also showed them the contents of this

a harmless display.

  In Gilpin's response, he praised the 'data' that had

response have made references on both sides to the fact
that 'students' approve/disapprove of the signon page.

        It seems incredible to me that the comment made
about data was ever even made! I would like to contend the
fact that the authors replies to this note do not have
any statistical backing. I submit the fact that as authors,
we sign on about 5-10 times a day then students do. If in
most(some) of these author sign ons, the signing on was
tough. Why aren't they too complaining about the added
time? I find it IMPOSSIBLE to believe that a student signs
in fast enough to even notice the effect. I personally have
only had one problem in signing on and it was probably
a line-error or something that really messes up the clock
page.

Let us be clear about what the issue is here. It is not
the mouse (which, by the way, is beautiful!), nor is it
a matter of vote counting among students, or of sobersided-
ness vs. dignity on plato.
        The issue is one of reasonable consideration of a
responsible person's request. Professor Marty has authored
more than 100 hours of well-reputed lessons. He has run
students for years. He seldom disturbs the solemnity of
NOTES with gripes or even requests. Yet on the basis of
his observations, he felt that a request was in this case
merited. His report, especially with the three corrobor-
ations it now has, is good enough for me.
        In my judgment, his note did NOT merit the torrent
of bad-tempered responses it received. A certain amount of
deference for the greater experience of others is _sometimes_
justified.

My original intent when this note started was to not insult
anyone, regardless of rank or absurdity of comments. It was
my feeling, though, that it would be unfair for people at
a single site to deprive others of something such as the
entry display. I did not feel that the people who started
the note gave consideration to the many hundreds of other
people who work on this system.
       It was only later, when the MFL people started making
some very insulting remarks (or insinuations) that I lost
all respect for their problem.
       I do think that their were many responses which were
out of line. To some people this would include my own.
       I definately feel, though, that the way to get your
suggestion acted upon is to not return those remarks. Maybe
we should not have any more entry displays.

Sorry that Mickey messed up the sign-on. We had tried
to break up the character loading so that there would be
2 short delays rather than 1 long one.

Having read these notes, I guess that i long delay at the

would be better. Then, as soon as you see the page, you
can type at the arrow.

There are two issues here (at least) that people are con-
fusing:
                
       1. The mouse is fun, aesthetically pleasing and
          humanizing.
                 
       2. There is much data to support the claim that
          signing-in is one of the most difficult (con-
          fusing) procedures for students. This statement
          is corroborated by almost every teacher who has
          run large numbers of students--both on the ele-
          mentary and university levels.

The implicaton of the above (from my viewpoint and I believe
the spirit of Professor Marty's comments) is that having
things like (1) without the problems of (2) is desirable.
(B. Anderson, in fact, suggested a solution). But if this
were not possible, the experience of many teachers would
suggest that the sign-on should be left alone. Keep the
fun and aesthetically pleasing things for your lessons.

Mr. Siegel:
        I couldn't agree with you more about the difficulty
that students have signing onto PLATO. I agree that it must
be kept as easy as possible.
        I am confused about one point, though, as a result
of that. For Professor Marty's students to have been
hampered by the entry (by the characters of their name not
getting taken until Mickey plotted) they would have to be
used to signing in before seeing the entry page plot. This
is normal for an author, but I have seen very few students
sign in that way. Normally they seem to prefer to wait so
that their keypresses are echoed back and they are sure that
they typed everything correctly.
        That is another reason why the initial complaint
surprised me. Maybe his students ARE an exception.

        When personal notes originally designed, it
was thought that most people would only keep a few notes
in their "note record", thus need for features such as these
was not concieved.
        It is obvious now, however, that we were wrong in
our conceptions, as my observations indicate that many
people keep 5-10 notes laying around all the time.
        I'm not sure if the solutions mentioned would
completely solve the problem of seeing the 'new' notes,
but something will be done in this area in the future.

In spite of improved disk delivery and more lesson space
available, we still don't have lessons to throw around.
People who "save 5-10" notes are using up lesson space and
somebody has to "pay" for it. I'm agasinst encouraging
people to save notes. Notes worth saving should be worth
copying into one's own lesson space. It would make more
sense for kim to concentrate on convenient transfer to
your own lesson.

A good point, but as long as there are those who choose to
save pertinent notes, why not let them and allow them to
move around freely and smoothly in their personal notes
file? To some people, lesson space may be at a premium,
and space to copy important notes may be lacking, Perhaps
a word or two from course directors concerning deletion of
stale personal notes would suffice...

Maybe site 27 is unique in this, but seem to have trouble
clearing the display. I'd guess about one in every 50-100
"erase screen"s doesn't. This has been happening on
different terminals, so I don't think that is the problem;
it may well be the *$!!** phone line. Anyway, I suspect
that most of these (very annoying) failures could be
prevented if, whenever PLATO sends an "erase screen", it
would send two of them in succession. Comments?

   I have talked to Mr. Stifle (the terminal designer) about
a similar problem. The problem, however, that I am familiar
with involves the terminal getting into a state where the
screen CANNOT be erased from program control. The white
clear switch must be activated to get full screen erases
to once again become functional.
   Mr. Stifle informed me that this is a state that the
Owens Illinois Digivue plasma display unit gets into, and is
not actually a failure of the terminal electronics.
   Everyone that I know who is familiar with this problem
would like to see it fixed. But since it is likely that it
is a design error in equipment which was not designed by
CERL, it may be very difficult to locate, and require a
large amount of time to repair.

        I have a proposal for a new command. The name
of this new command would be called the "in" command.
Example of syntax:

in termnum

        This command would give a return in error similar
to the press command. This would enable lessons with
student banks in common to determine whether or not a
person was still in the lesson. This can be accomplished
right now with the press command, but that is a rather
time consuming process for the person doing the press.

The press command works well enough in most instances,
provided you take two simple precautions:
Always press funkey (0200). This key will not affect
anything in TUTOR except an untagged pause or a keytyped
pause in which funkey is specified.
Space out your presses so that they aren't done at once.
For instance, if you have some point at which you single
out a given terminal number, press funkey then and change
that person's common flag if an error results.
Other savings are possible. For instance, if you are keeping
track of routed students in a lesson, do a -lessin- command
on the lesson the student is supposedly in. Students who
are in lessons that are not in can then be checked with
-press-, while students in "in" lessons can be left alone.

Press works well in all but ONE instance:

        while in judging... we have, on occasion, experienced
post-pause errors (and rightly so!) as a result of the
automatic "pause 1" or "return" or whatever is executed....
A command to check this would uncomplicate programming
considerably -- I always hate to have to program around
deficiencies in any system.

   A modification of the suggested command would be:

in station¬$,lesson $$lesson a literal char tag
* which would be optional

setting error to the corresponding values.
It would seem that this MIGHT be used as an invasion
of privacy if one wanted to do so but that could be
eliminated by making 'lesson' a non-symbolic tag,
and/or checking -jumpout- codes.
This would be very good for routers and lessons that
rely on jumpouts to other lessons for their operation.

  Silas: true, press is fine for certain aplications
but it is completely useless in a tight loop which
is useful for initializing common.

1.      Tell the caller your feelings about his call.
        Do this by saying something like: "I'm busy right

        XX o'clock," Your statement should be a short

You can skip through replies to a note by pressing the
number of responses you want to skip, instead of pressing
a function eky. However, this method limits you to only
skipping 9 responses at a time, so to get from the original
note to response 25, say, you would have to press 9, then
9 again, then 7. However, it _does_ beat pressing -LAB- 25
times in a row.

This method will also work if you are already into the
responses; to skip from response 7 to response 9, you press
2.

        As Judy Sherwood pointed out approx. 1 month ago,
it is much easier to type "notes", "aids", etc., than
to remember 5.34 ?10^2 different combinations of function
keys, and where they take you. With other current problems
at hand, more keys to take you to exotic places are a
pain, and take away time that all systems people
(hopefully) need to work on important things.
As it is now, and as someone else (I think Jim Ghesquiere)
pointed out, the number of current "options" via LAB1, LAB,
DATA, DATA1, NEXT1,......... are confusing to all,
especially to new authors. Please, no more!!!!

  11/19     15.13     warner       iu

There is a problem of semantics which is confusing several
of our new authors.
Two entities exist on PLATO that are similar to lessons.
One is used for storing large and cumbersome amounts of
data on the disk: this entity is called a data_set_.
The other is used for keping track of students in course
records: this is called a data_file_.
Can we alter one of those names by mutual agreement, say
call one a "storeset" or the other a "tracer file"?
Or _something_?
The best time to do it would be now, when the names are
fresh in everyone's mind.

minutes of careful explanation to forever engrave the
two in my mind ... are your "new authors" actually having
that much difficulty in comprehending this? Could I possibly
be of assistance in directing their confusion? Why bother
with putting a new slit of clothes on something as simple
as this?

   It took me a while to learn the difference between
   AndersOn and AndersEn ... yet nobody suggested that
   these two people change their names as to make it

In many fields there are terms and/or definitions which
gives various degrees of trouble to newcomers; 'debit' and
'credit' in accountancy and 'random variable' in statistics
are two examples. Suggestions for straightening such things
out, however, are usually met with a solid wall of resis-
tance from those who are used to them. This is partly
because they tend to forget how uncomfortable it was, when
everything was new to THEM, to have such additional and
gratuitous difficulties to unravel. But mostly it is
because the harder it is for a newcomer to become compe-
tent, the more distinction there is between those who
have already made it and those who have not yet done so.
        The datafile/dataset pair is perhaps a minor exam-
ple, but the general principle may be applicable to Frye's
reply. I'm glad to say that PLATO people usually are less
this way than many others.

Sleator is right about "course", as many of us use it. But

our students, that is--it ISN'T that way.?
What I'm saving is, that my students (but not my group's

which really are courses in the usual university sense
of the word.

Dave,
   The long "delay" which you experience (with everyone else
on the system as an aside) when trying to get to the author
mode page when the system is just brought up is caused by
the fact that lesson "edit" has not been condensed by anyone
and needs to be condensed before anyone (author status)
can enter the system ( altho you may notice that if you hit
stop1 at the blank screen you get the student mode page -
which happens to be lesson plato which is condensed as soon
as you hit next from the 'Press NEXT to Begin' page.)

(1) Lessons are NOT re-condensed EVERY time they are
  used...binaries ARE made to keep down the condensing
  load.
(2) For lessons put away for a long time:
  a. Keeping a binary would essentially double the space
     required for saving the lesson (since the text MUST
     be saved).
  b. Major system changes in the interim could easily
     make the binary inoperable and useless.

As for me, it is gpeat for debugging, as -zero-, -add1-,
and -sub1- stand out better than -calc-, Also, PLEASE
keep in mind that TUTOR is NOT intended only for those
who know about computers, but for teachers and other
schlocks like me who don't give a hoot about any other
language than TUTOR.

If you're REALLY interested in speed, keep the
expressions out of the -doto- tag, i.e.

calc     end?start+len
         doto 10,n1?start,end,inc
         n(n1)?0
10

Is faster than:

doto    10, n1?start,start+len,inc
        n(n1)?0
10

The index parameters are evaluated each time
through the loop.

The original point of the note is missed.
  the -find- command could be done via a similar setup

doto    1,ind?start,start+len?inc,inc
branch  n(ind) -obj,x,1out,x
1
        ind?-1
1out

 _BUT_ (and this is important) why is there a find command??
I, would contend that it is a common function (no pun)
that is used enough to warrent a machine level program
to reduce the overall system load. The pattern writing
command I proposed is at least worth some though since
patterns through areas of variables are used for a

  Are you talking about something that would be essentially
a condense, or 'load' time operation, and not executable?
  I have often wished for something like that which didn't
take up the space, or take the time of executable code, for
initialization of a given set of variables.

  Just a thought.
Since there seems to be so much mis-information floating
around about what is and what is not efficient in TUTOR,
perhaps a program could be written in which an author
could type in 2 sequences of code that he wishes to
compare and have the code condensed then executed a given
number of times. The timing could be done and statistics
for the code computed (ie: proctim, absoloute time, ms/sec,
standard deviation these measurments, ecs, etc...)
  _OR_ rather than writing a system lesson: give the
authors some unambiguous, completely accurate algorithm
for doing such tests on their own. I have heard of
many different methods of testing and reasons why each
is better than the other. However since I dont have
the background on the operating system and PLATO executor,
I am in a poor position to judge between them.

write PROCEDURE TAKES

      ¬os,proctim-v2¬1 cpu microsecnds
Execute this once without any code inside
to see how long the -doto- loop takes.
Then execute it with the code and subtract
the time required by the -doto- loop.
This procedure is as accurate as the vagaries of CDC
and PLATO permit. It gives a consistent value for most

  The value of -proctim- is in seconds, not milliseconds
or microseconds.
  Normally, the amount of time the loop requires is not a
factor, the main question is- which piece of code is more
efficient, and not, how fast is it. The amount of time a
given peice of code will take may vary according to the
code sorrounding it. (eg, what registers are available, is
the stack being flushed because of a branch etc..)
  How much this variance might be I couldn't guess, that
depends on how TUTOR sets things up.

r.e. warner: I'll bet that gives a consistent answer,
but I'd also say it would be terribly inaccurate! i.e:

 O=* *proctim* is only updated once each timeslice;
   thus you would have to do a *return* before finding
   its final value.

 O=* *clock* is a millisecond clock -- how could it be
   accurate to .1 msec???

 O=* You are writing text before showing "proctim-v3";
   the final value of proctim should be computed
   immediately after the *return*...

 O=* The whole routine should be run many, many times
   to determine an average time -- one set of loops
   will never be accurate, as you are too dependent
   on spur-of-the-moment background jobs, etc....

        Also remember that code operating under heavy
system (autobreak) loads will take MORE time to do the
same thing because of the extra processing required to
divide the mainframe's time equitably... also, some commands
will operate under a higher overhead because of the same
reason, and some loops will be interrupted somewhat more
erratically on a light load than a heavy one, where a
constant amount of proctim/sec seems to be guaranteable
more often than at night, where time slice to time slice
loads can vary because of the smaller number of users,
and therefore divisions of time that have to be made...

I think that accurate timing for a single block of code is

different methods of doing the same thing, thus I think the
problems Fuller mentioned are not that preclusive, since
they look like the kind of things that would effect all
commands equally... It would be interesting some time
to take statistics on the amount of author time spent
writing and executing units named "test"...

Some comments which may throw some light on the issue but
won't solve the problems:
        no registers are saved between tutor commands..thus
a string of tutor commands will always execute the same
computer instructions regardless of the surrounding tutor
code.
        Unlike many/most timesharing systems, there is no
more "thrashing" in cpu execution at high load times. The
catch is that because we have a dual cpu system, the cpu
executing tutor code is likely to be degraded by conflicts
with the other cpu during high load periods.
        If you follow frye's suggested changes to warner's
code, you should be able to make reasonable comparisons.
But be sure to make head to head comparisons...if you save
figures the changing cpu conflicts may spoil your data.

It seems that if you try to do a -showa- with a length too
high the system simply does nothing (no execution error, no
output-- nothing).  The maximum length seems to vary.
A vain attempt to find it revealed it to be 313 words
yesterday; however, today it is 311 words. If a -return-
is inserted before  the -showa-, the maximum length is
increased to 317 words. Because of inline animation,
zerofilling, backspacing, carriage returns, etc. an
extremely long -showa- is not that useless. Is there any
chance of getting this thing fixed/documented/cleared up
in the near future?

---------- response 1
  11/21     15.54     walker       s

The limiting factor you are running into is the quantity of
output being produced, not the number of words in the showa.
There are 2 limits. 1) After you have amassed a certain
amount (used to be 30 seconds worth) of output for the
terminal, you are shut off until that has been sent. This
is to prevent a small number of terminals from hogging the
output buffers. 2) There is a limit to the amount of out-
put which may be generated in i timeslice.

A showa of 300 words will generate very different amounts
of output depending on the contents of those words. Do you
really have to do it all at once???

---------- response 2
  11/21     18.29     parrello       uimatha
Hmmm.  In my case, it didn't shut off until something was
sent, it just simply failed to send anything at all.  If
there really is a limit to the amount of output that can be
sent, then could this be documented somewhere so that poor
fools like me don't waste so much time tracking it down?
(When the machine does absolutely nothing, one dose not
assume immediately that some obscure limit has been
reached.)  And yes. I _have_ to show it all at once.

      Sorry about the unclarity.
      My experience was with ¬6 any student, ok
-  that is, the  'new student' option accepted
'any student,' (no backspaces), with the comma causing the
trouble.  The signon and student deletion mechanisms
wouldn't accept that string, tho 'any student' was listed
in the roster.  Deleting everybody 'solved' the problem.
(Since there are no actual students enrolled yet, this was
feasible.)
      There are various discrepancies among the roster-
display, course-record, and signon mechanisms aside from
this -- e.g., you can create and use a signon c=¬I=v¬I (c, bs,
access, I, bs, sub, access, I) but it displays as c=vi on the
roster.

      Only the really undeletable names (like the comma'd
one) are the sort of problem that systems could easily do
anything about; and perhaps they should.

would that create any great problems?????

Would be a way to get rid of the unwanted name.....

The CERL PLATO classroom, Room 203b, will be moved to
Room 165 (first floor) during the Thanksgiving holidays.
Therefore, the 203b terminals will not be available between
8 am Wednesday, November 27, and 8 am Monday, December 2.

The new classroom will be open 24 hours a day as was 203b.

Sometime during the week of Dec.2, the computer operators
will move their headquarters from Room 468 to Room 166
across from the new CERL classroom.

After the operators' move, printout distribution will take
place from the operators' office and not from Room 257.

Well, I know part of the reason:?
The Computer Science and Accountancy Departments are
acquiring 25 terminals to be shared between them 50/50.
(Each department plans to use 1200 terminal-hours per
week, prime time, next semester, to teach LARGE classes
on Plato.)  The plan is to put the new terminals and the
203b terminals in adjacent rooms. Some of the time, at
least, all 48 terminals will be allocated to a single
large site, so that some very large lessons can be used.
That means that if we use the "public" terminals some
of the time, "our! terminals will be used by others
some of the time. The result should be the opportunity
for a bigger site for all of us who use those 48 terminals.

     Is "acquire" really the right term? I was under the
impression that these terminals are CERL's and simply
being scheduled by the Accountancy and Computer Science

new room are still to be regarded as a general resouce
for everyone and available to all except during the
hours when students have been scheduled.

Other reasons/benefits of the move:

1) As pointed out, prints will be with operators, rather
than in 257. Hopefully both the "lost print" and
"locked-up" print problems will be minimized.

2) Easy access by wheelchairs.... 203b has been a real
problem for _classes_ whose students use wheelchairs.
students have had to come instead to room 257, which is
bad for all.

3) People (warm bodies) in the immediate vicinity of the 
ladies restroom even late at night. (Have had 2 "incidents"
that I know of. Thankfully not serious.)

The problem is your  "bump  -,_" .
The  "_" is a shift 6, so a response of .876 gets stored as
.87 which is too far from  .875 to be judged correct.

Also, the response  .8765 gets bumped to .875 which is ok

The above is an excellent example of the necessity for
formulating a "simple case"  of code that seems to function
in a weird manner.  Often the problem is swiftly identified
as soon as the removal fo innocent-looking surrounding
commands cures the glitch.  If it is cured, you have
sharpened your own problem-solving skills and saved yourself
some embarrassment.  If it isn't cured, you will have an
easily understood problem that has a high probability of
getting immediate attention by those who can help.

of the micro from my lesson! I'm sure it was a -micro-

        I've been thinking about some problems PLATO is
sure to run into as more schools use it to teach course
material. It seems to me that the system will have to
compete with publishers for the services of respected
teachers. Publishers can offer copywrites and royalties,
while the unauthorized use of computer software is nowhere
near as well protected against. Further, PLATO is not now
--and probably won't be in he future--able to pay people
like (say) Linus Pauling or Carl Sagan to produce material
for system use. Developing course for PLATO can be as large
an undertaking as writing a textbook of comparable coverage,
and it seems clear that most professionals are going to go
where the money is. This may seem crassly cynical, but the
competition schools go through to get and keep high quality
teachers should be an indication of what PLATO may be in
for.

---------- response 1
  11/22     11.30     avner       s

There will be provision for copyright of PLATO materials
and distribution of royalties for their use. Details are
being worked out for one such agreement between the
University of Illinois and CDC. Such an arrangement cannot
be placed in effect on PLATO, however, until the current
funding by NSF is completed.

of the system on which they were produced

copyrights of these materials?

---------- response 3
  11/22     12.21     avner       s

The source of support of the individual involved (including
any local arrangements with your own institution) would
probably determine ownership of lessons. There is no simple
way to generally specify ownership under the wide variety of
conditions under which PLATO materials have been produced.

system...since copyrights do protect the copyrighted

of the holder of the copyright.

   Such problems as mentioned in the original note
will be around until a very much larger system is
available. (Say, >10,000 users.) Then the economy
of scale (more potential users of any given lesson)
will make the royalties worth the time and effort
of producing (or supervising the production of) lesson
material.

   I believe that such systems are being considered as
am outgrowth of the PLATO experiece.

Perry has esentially the right idea...However the Plato
system as it exist now is not capable of competing with
publishing houses since the system is not large enough
to make this worth while. The problem to which Orpheus
addresses himself is one which is in the distant
if not non-existant future considering the cutback in
University funds for such things as Plato.

--and reassuring. It's good to know that thought is being
given to this sort of problem before real trouble starts.

        Glaucon appears to have little faith in the future
of the PLATO system and its ability to eventually become
self-supporting, a pessimism which I doubt that many of us
share. If we did, the issue I raised would probably be
moot, because PLATO would not be the stimulating experience.

For example, it could happen that all the high-cpu users

I think what's going on here is that when you bump your

updated on disk. This would include the "you have mail"

     I like the new system alot, except for one thing:
Why do you have to do a shift-stop after entering your
course? It gets quite annoying after being used to
just zipping right through that page to have to do a
shift-stop...could this be taken out?

---------- response 1
  11/23     15.41     rick       mflu

I am wholly in favor of putting the shift-stop after the
course rather than after your name, because it better
protects your password. On the old system, if you miss
the NEXT key after typing your course, people who are
inclined to watch will see your password, or at least some
of it. This way, you have to be careful or you won't get
past the TYPE YOUR COURSE page, so that you insure that
your password won't appear on the screen.
  Thanks, systems, for the change.

   It seems better not to queue keys up for displays that
you haven't seen--this could be disastrous. In other words,
if you are being processed slowly and enter many, many
keys, all of which we kept, you could be "doing" things
erroneously on displays you haven't even seen yet. So
long as the system keeps up with everything, there is no
problem. When there is not enough processing to go around,
users are going to be slowed down... and we do not want to
bog the system down further by accumulating long queues of
keys.

actually I think that the mailman is quite an attention

What happens is that the line number you specify is the

Probably the lesson never was recondensed. It stayed
in ECS from the flawed disk copy, while you backed out
to use student records. Then when you came in again,
PLATO found a (flawed) copy still in ECS, and used
that.
This can happen in nonprime hours, To fix it, condense
the lesson by STOP1 from the author page, before you
back out.

   The 1st block will indeed be the last one changed
(the directory is changed) immediately after doing a
recovery. If you edit--make CHANGES--to a block, then
that block will be marked as the last one edited...oh:
one special case (ha): if your edit occurs within the
same MINUTE as the recovery, then the "last block picker"
will pick the 1st one it finds! I assume that you will
find that either you did not make a change to the block
or that the time of last edit for it and the directory
block are identical, If you can actually document a
case where the last block edited is not found, please
do so.

        One can create an author, and upon initial

Dr. Morgan of the Dept. of Vet. Phy. and Pharm. suggests
a Seminar Announcement Bulletin Board on PLATO for
campus-wide coverage. At present notices must be sent
out and these are costly. Sometimes they are lost before
the seminar. With the seminar program, one could check on
the seminars for a particular day or a particular College.

Another interesting value to such a program would be the
ability to provide seminars on short notice. For example,
a visting colleague might put on a seminar the following
day by having the announcement on PLATO; otherwise, such
be proper publicity.

PLATO-associated seminars are announced in notes (and
sometimes on some entry page as you sign in). Are you
talking about all the other seminars on campus? They are
already covered in posted schedules on many many bulletin
boards. Of course, I often do not read those notices,
nor would I if they were posted on PLATO. It is true that
quick turn-around would be helpful for spur-of-the-moment
seminars. Maybe a general bulletin board would be useful
if appropriately cataloged, so I could look just at
announcements of seminars in my field.

University of Southern Guam is currently doing extensive
research in writing code for PLATO by thought. It is
almost developed and when completed will only require
minor cranial and frontal lobe alterations for authors.
This small inconvenience will more than pay for itself
since sign on can be done before arriving at the site,

available. The only forseeable problem is that if you

A minor suggestion re: new signon. The instructions say
to press STOP while holding down SHIFT. Later they reverse
the order and say press SHIFT then press STOP. Might this

or is SHIFT-STOP ==/ STOP-SHIFT.

   The key is the phrase "while holding down"--this seems
to be essential information to convey; if you can write
a simple sentence in good English that places the word
SHIFT in front of the word STOP and conveys the same
information, please do so. The basic test of the wording
in the long run, of course, is simply whether people have
any trouble understanding the directions or not! And we
really don't have much data on that yet.

This morning on site network I added 6 students to a course

instructor mode. I then tried to check one of them to
be sure that everything was all right. I got the message
that an error had occurred. I went back to look at the
roster again and the students I had just entered and tem-
plated were no longer there. This was repeatable and
extremely annoying!!! P.S. I checked in rm.203B now
and all the records look ok now, so the problem seems
to occur when checking the curriculum option on a record

The problem that I mentioned yesterday is repeatable and
pretty dangerous.
I had block b closed with p option.
then:
1. deleted block b.
2. recovered by DATA.The deleted block apeared as block m.
3. inserted at the begining of that recovered block a write
    command.
  (there was unit name there with a bad label.)
4. now condensed the lesson . It started with the write
  command from the last block!!(the recovered one that
 was block b before deletion and was closed by p option
there.)

students get the code from the last blocks as a part of their
intial entry unit...(it didnt have unit name).

        My gosh! Haven't you ever heard of the HELP key?
It seems to me that when in doubt, or in need of 'general
instructions', it is only natural to press HELP to find
out what is going on. Just to make sure that HELP works,
we just signed in, pressing HELP on every page. Only
once did it fail to elaborate on the subject. In general
it seemed to explain the proper course of action very well.

        The new displays may take a lot of getting used
to (I'm still editing a lot of lessons that I'd rather
view as a student!), but I certainly don't think the new
system is confusing. A great deal of time was spent by
MANY people to insure that comments such as yours would
not occur. Where did we fail?

you don't think about the help key, when something as
extraordinary as a complete revision on the author
manuvering occurs on you suddenly. Thank goodness I
was warned in advance, since I was on at non_prime time
when they decided to dc the first experimental runs of
the new system, so on the singon page, they did at that
time say, "read the help pages." Why they didn't do that
when the system was actually permamently put on, I don't
know. Oh well, such is life. I do think the note was

spends their life on PLATO too (the message got to be a

most users would have seen the testing of this revised

during non-prime hours) or would have read the extensive

weeks ago.

To lhn of mtcc:
        In familiar-looking situations, one naturally
makes habitual responses, and it can be exceedingly
frustrating when the usual results aren't obtained.
But now that you have, presumably, found your way around,
what do you think of the new procedures relative to the
old ones? I would prefer a couple things to be different
from what they are, but all around I think the new way
has to be considered a big improvement. Don't you?
If so, please say so. As has been pointed out, David
Frankel, Rick Blomme, and several others put a lot of effort
into tryng to improve things. A word or two of appreciation

Actually, I would like to see a grass roots (if not honest

thier lives on PLATO, but do author once or twice a week
in thier free time. I for one was a PLATO fanatic when I
was at the U of I and could tell you systems changes almost
the minute they occured, but now teaching in the real world
has limited my time. Perhaps if it comes out there are more
people who are not on PLATO 20 hours a day, we will see
better lines ofcommunication between systems, pso, and
authors. I love PLATO madly, but find I can accomplish
little work in mu four hours a week because it takes me
three and a half hours a week to search out and read all the
new notes, system changes, etc, etc, etc, etc!

Does anybody out there know the difference between
using MICRO FONT and ACCESS FONT in a microtable
sequence to prevent the erasure of a font which precedes
normal characters.

"Aids" suggests that the two are identical.
Is it correct that they have the same function
in this case although they are different keys?
(The internal key codes appear to be the same.)
---------- response 1
  11/26     21.44     judy       pso

yes, they're the same....

Part of the reason for the confusion is that, for a long
time, there were places where the "micro" key was non-
functional. So if you wanted to put in an access code
(076) you _had_ to press shift-square, which was called
"access". The micro _key_ now functions in the micro _table_
editor, so I guess we should reword that section of aids.

planning to use this handy scheme in design of new microtable.

Judy, PLaTO's response should still indicate what the
problem is. Telling a student to try another terminal
even at "mixed" sites is still a very "hit or miss"
thing. What about site directors writing their own

prevails.

the worst part of the problem is in the case of a misspelled

someone a while back made the suggestion that the
unacceptable course name should be displayed for
the student along with the comment that the trouble
might be one of spelling... that seems like a great
idea!

An interesting piece of confusion exists due to the
amalgamation of the author and student mode pages.
When you type the name of a course, and press NEXT,
the page appears saying "You do not have the proper
security code! etc. (assuming you do not).
But if you type the course name and then hit DATA
(as you might do accidentally) a message pops up
which says "Does Not Exist!"
Now we old hands know that this message means both
"Lesson Does Not Exist" and "Not A TUTOR Lesson"
but some of the new people express amazement at the
sight of a "lesson" appearing and disappearing
depending on which key you press. Can that message
be changed to "not a Lesson", or can it take you
to course records anyway if you press DATA?

Maybe everybody but me knows this trick, but here is a
useful and not obvious way to use -ansv-/-wrongv-:

arrow   1215
store   x
ansv    52
wrongv  x+1+[x<0]
write   Your answer is negative!
wrongv  x+1+[(2int(x/2)) ¬= x]
write   Your number is not an even integer.
..etc..
The logical expressions in brackets are -1 when true,
cancelling the +1, leaving "wrongv x" to match against
the student'5 number, which is also x.

An interesting but apparently undocumented feature:
A routed student thrown out of a lesson thru a shift-stop
condense gets the system flag 'errtype' set to 3 - meaning
'memory allocation exceeded'. It happens to be a useful
thing to have happen, as far as our router is
concerned; but is it intentional? permanent?

   Common will not (of course) be updated if the system
crashes, but it is hard to believe that it could be
zeroed by/in/during/after a crash (surely not in any
regular way!) You can always return common "by hand"
(via one of the options available from AUTHOR MODE display)
if important changes have occurred, and it will always
be updated whenever the last person referencing it leaves
the lesson he is in. As for system crashes, they are
obviously unwelcome to us all and we keep trying our best
to avoid them.

     Does anyone know of any lessons to instruct potential
authors in the art of using TUTOR effectively___________? Having gone
through many of the lessons on PLATO  I think something
line this is sorely needed!

     I believe that tco much stress has been put on getting
a large quantity of lesson material written, and not enough
stress on the quality of this material. Rare is the author
indeed who employs any significant amount of response
judging for wrong_____ answers, in addition to that for right
answers. The power of the TUTOR language for sequencing a
student through a lesson is also rarely  used to much ad-
vantage, outside of an occasional help unit or two.

     I think a lesson on technique_________ would be very beneficial
in improving the quality of lessons currently being written.

Got it! the bug where you press next to go into the

enter a lesson,
goto aids,
do anything or nothing.... makes no difference
press next1,
exit the lesson,
enter any lesson where you were the last author
(or where you have inspect code)
(doesn't matter if you have to change your security code)
(if you are in inspect, and DATA1 to change security code,
the condition is corrected)
(it also doesn't matter if block a was last block edited)
bak! you are block a,

Also, the new way of responding...  even respond to a
different person without losing your place in your

however, the first time I read a continued
note and tried to delete it on the first half
(after reading the whole thing) it just played
dumb and sat there...but that wasn't repeatable at
all, so don't worry about it, anyone.

one more thing... if you can edit and/or delete notes
that haven't been responded to in gen.  or help notes,
why can7t you do the same to personal notes that
haven't been looked at??

   lesson plato is the lesson you are in when you are
at the author mode arrow. When you type plato at that
arrow and press next you are requesting to edit a system
program (lesson). If you press data, you are attempting to
jumpout to the lesson you are in which is kind of stupid
seeing as how you are at the first arrow anywho.

Actually, Jim, that arrow is in lesson edit.
Lesson plato contains the sign on sequence, among

The reason for the "judge ignore" at that arrow
is so people don't attempt to jumpout to system

  The error you got is a frequent one. It happens everytime
you press -STOP1- while  -plato- is being brought up after
a crash or reload.
  If you get an out error with something other than
0<
then you will have something (or someone will) to worry
about.

Do I understand correctly, then, that it is unnecessary
(not to mention a waste of space here in notes) to report
out-errors of the 0 type?
                  0

If that is the case, why not revise the instructions seen
upon encountering any out-error to request reporting of
the error UNLESS it is of the 0 type (in which case it can
                              0
be ignored).

Seems this would save us the trouble of writing these notes,

yes, some system's personal recondensed one of the system
lessons that people frequently use. It would appear
that maybe there is a bug with doing this. At least this
error has some reasoning behind it.


At initial load this error also occurs (might be thought
 of  as a jumpout failing because of stop 1 being pressed
 and it kinda thinking you are -all ready signed in-).
The message at initial load of plato should be ignored,
but all other occurances should be reported.

         When you are in editing records, you are in a 
different lesson (records) than the editor (edit thru edit2)

be different... perhaps the record editor authorities

When you type Uunitname it stores it in a buffer.
If the unite isn't found you can go into the next block
and just press next instead of retyping the command.
This works with all such editor commands I think.

Also, to speed things up, do a L1 before typing in

              it is posible to limet the time for each
          disk access so that a complete lesson search would
          take no more disk accesses/sec than to do it by
          hand. after all, if you have to exaustively search,
          you will make the same number of accesses anyway.
          or, if this is still somehow unacceptable, then
          at least give us users the facilty of pressing
          next1 to go to the next block (like the system
          staff already has). i disagree with bruce that
          either of these changes would cause sloppier coding.

how YOU think special characters could be handled diff-

How about a joint micro/charset editor? Normally when
we create a multiple character it is quite nice to
be able to use a micro to type it in the lesson. So
when creating a multiple character why not automatically
create a micro on the first key of the craracter which will
properly position the parts of the character. It would
also make it possible for someone not familier with the
charset to inspect the contents of the charset.
  I'll admit that if implemented this may lead to very
unorganized charsets.....

the AIDS lessons are actually several lessons. to return
to the EDITOR, one must return to lesson "aids" itself, then
go to the EDITOR. lesson "aids" is usually in ECS (or in a
form where it does not have to wait for the condensor).
however, there are a few times when lesson "aids" must be
re-condensed. when the short "waiting to condense" message
is seen, one is actually waiting for lesson "aids"to be
condensed. we try to keep this to a minimum.

Where x is the length of each dash in dots and the

You can, of course, implement such a " command" by writing
your own tutor unit to accomplish this, and it would, de-
pending on how well it was programmed, work as fast as
a similar tutor command...I believe that Judy Sherwood
has a routine already written to do this...
Basically, the -draw- command takes advantage of the
terminal line generator, which will draw a line between
two specified points. A broken line would require sending
two points for EACH piece of line, in addition to other
necessary screen commands (details not important here)..
Suppose you had a broken line with 8 pieces. This line
would require, at the least, 24 output parcels to the
terminal...as opposed, for the same unbroken line, to 3
(average) parcels....i.e. 8 times as slow.....
This is just to show that broken lines represent a lot
of delay in displaying, and could not be as fast as a
regular line.Dave

        I'm not convinced by frye's arguments. Sized
writing is slow too, but I don't think anyone would argue
that it shoulon't have been implemented. Besides, later
versions of the PLATO terminal will probably be capable of
doing this sort of thing much faster--just as they will
be able to do sized writing much faster. There are a
lot of feature of this system that have been implemented
for convinience--not for efficiency. As someone once said
in another note on another subject, this isn't IBM.

Help yourself.

a -drawb- command might come...... unless the "new,
improved terminals" come first. Plans are that the new
terminals should include a broken line generator. Last

about a line like this: --------------------------.

In a certain sense _all_ lessons are options to be had from
the author mode page. The more you have as options the
more complicated the way in which you invoke those options.
So pretty soon,, you have to use the whole name......e. !testor",
"repair" to start the lesson. Do you call testor so often
that a shift-Tes (shift-T is already used) as an option
would simplify your life considerably?

One vote for option "f" (request a terminal be Fixed) on

      how close or far away he was by selecting
       taking pot shots at parts of the array.
      My teacher would like to know how intelligence
       was judged by this lesson, and would appreciate
      knowing the lesson name or the authors' since

  I made this same suggestion about 5_6 months ago
and it recieved some support. I think it bears repeating
in these (or soon to come) troubled times of cpu shortages.

  In order to minumize cpu usage in lessons that make
use of rotated graphics, trig graphs, and a miriad of
other uses of trig functions where accuracy is not of the
essence, one of two thins (or both) could be done:
1)  Keep resident in ecs a table of trig functions
which could be interpolated to. an accuracy of 1 part in
512 for any given angle.

2)  Create a set of trig functions which would have
a low default accuracy, or an optional accuracy.

  I wonder what percentage of the trig references in CAI
need the full floating-point mantissa accuracy that CDC
provides. Comments?

If you are doing a large plot, a table look-up saves
a lot of cpu time--it's quite visible as the plot is
drawn.

There are tables around.... "zielinski" of "matha" has
one of sine and cosine. It is stored in common and
referenced by defined variables.

One thing you may be able/forced to do is to actually
-draw- the plot, once you have selected the one you like.
Bob Zielinski has lovely spheres, but they are slow, even
with the table look-up, We messed around and decided on
a basic size that we used over and over and just drew the
thing with -dot- and -circle- commands. The savings in
time are striking. And, of course, we are still able to
use his routine for non-standard spheres.

What does anyone think about a new feature for authors

        The way I picture it, when an author signed in.
he/she could set the 'alarmclock' to page him at a given
time. This would help us by not having to check our watches
so often.
        When activating this, it would give the current
time and ask when the author wished to be paged. . . . it might,
perhaps , page for 15 secs or until stopped (somehow).

It is indeed likely that the present form is what will

How about a slightly different version of the same idea
which can be 'used' by another program. One could send
a message to a student telling him that he has been on
long enough.

We've had a problem here because the terminal use is
sometimes so much that we only let some people work an
hour on the terminal before they have to give it up to
someone else. The alarm would be very useful for this.

     The continued option was put in only as a
convenience for sending notes to only one other person,
Thus, if you want to send continued notes to more than
person, you should 1st send it to yourself, than send
copies to everyone else with the SHIFT-DATA option
while reading your note.
        I doubt this will be changed as you request anytime

2) *change*ing 999 to stop causes any occurence of 999
    (as a statement label) to act as an actual stop.?
3) *change*ing stop* to xxx has the expected result of
    making any occurence of xxx to act as a stop*.?

Question:??         A recent change in the AUTHOR MODE display reflects
CPU usage in terms of "machine instructions per second".
I believe this information is not accurate, as the average
of an average machine instruction on this machine is NOT
1 microsecond.
?        It *ould seem that the problem is one of displaying
usage of your lesson relative to a typical TUTOR lesson.
There appear to be a couple of solutions to this:

        a) display CPU usage relative to an AVERAGE
            TUTOR lesson, and/or

        b) display CPU usage relative to the 2 msec/sec
            "limit" recently discussed.

  The msec/sec time...or whatever is of greatest use to
the author, something a little more explicit available to
the author would be nice, especially when trying to make a
lesson more efficient. Such as, 1) the number of executable
instr. 's in the lesson, and/or 2) the average cp time per
instruction (could be calculated given 1)
  Or give an author some indication of what goes on at the
condensed level, so as to give him an idea how to code
efficiently. This would, not necessarily appear every time
the lesson was executed, but possibly an option by which
tutor would be put into a 'data collection' or 'statistics'
mode for collecting data on program performance.

to set straight an error in Frye'2 note...

it is not as simple as using the average machine instruction
execution time

what is needed is the average time used by an average
sample of machine instructions as used in the PLATO/TUTOR
operating system...

let me assure everyone taht in the hundreds of times I
did this exercise in the last 5 years...the number in
question is indeed very close to 1,000,000 instructions
per second per central processor unit on a CYBER 73
(indeed, as recent as 02:30 I evaluated a 15 machine
instruction loop in concept judging at 20 microseconds!!!)

Serious constderation will be made of the second point...
namely, we should state something much easier to understand
such as..."your lesson is fine"..."your lesson is twice as
bad as the average"..."your lesson is far out!"

I must be missing something obvious here---what did
the "msec/sec" message fail to tell us (that it's useful to
know) that the new message does tell us?
        Provided one knows the break point (s), the "msec/
sec" message would seem to tell the author, about as well
as any message could, just waht he needs to know aobut how
his lesson will fare in the CPU competition.
        Not so?

---------- response 6
  12/06     19.38     blomme       s

   First, sampling measurements on the TUTOR executor
consistently show taht the CPU is running at 1 million
instructions per second with a margin of error almost
certainly less than 10: The exact number of instructions
executed by any one lesson does of course depend upon
the "mix" of instructions that lesson uses.
   Second, it is important that users not expect that
their guarantee has to do with LENGTH of processing time,
but rather with AMOUNT of processing. Thus, if and when
we should get a machine twice as fast, the autobreak time
average would be reset to 5 ms/sec--BUT THE AMOUNT OF
PROCESSING AVAILABLE WOULD REMAIN THE= SAME! It is to
help emphasize this point that the "ms/sec" terminology
has been removed. Hopefully we will be able to find
some improvements in the wording to communicate the
meaning better.

Taking into account the fact that alarm is still not a

implementation it may have in the future.

Currently, when you get an alarm, it seems that it stops
after a keypress. Since the message looks sort of like
the -TERM talk- message, why not run something sort of
parallel to it? When yoy get an alarm, the only way to
turn it off is to do something like, perhaps,?
   -TERM alarmed-?
similar to -TERM talk or reject- to get the talk message

Good idea, Mike B. -alarm- as a -term- would be very
useful. Many times have I gone into a lesson and
remembered that I wanted to set an alarm, and had to
back out to do it. It's used often at this site

Perhaps the print boxes should be in a public area and
an option added to 'requests', that allows you to specify
taht your print should be held by the operator rather than
placed in the print box.  This would provide easy access

Two things can cause this...one is a from command in the

a special section. The other is an ieu that makes a
distinction between author and student entries. This ieu

The COMMON codewords must match for the leslist command
to succeed.?
Incidentally, this poses some serious problems. One can
easily have unrelated leslists and commons; they should
not be protected by the same codeword. For example, a
large group of lessons may have to share the same leslist;
some of the lessons may have their own. unrelated commons.
It's inviting problems to have to put the same common
codeword on all these unrelated commons; but that's what
you have to do to share the same leslist.?
The same problem obtains with datasets.?
Please, systems, we need SEPARATE codewords for common,
leslist, and dataset!

I'm not sure which is worth more -- the convenience of a
separate codeword, or the relative simplicity of NOT having
the codeword. I have no doubt, however, that most experi-
enced tutor authors assume that they will get a condense
error if codewords do not match. And they don'i! Thus
router lessons have been condensed with mismatched code-
words, by programmers who thought they had done all nec-
essary testing. Even tho leslist is an executable command,
it should give a condense error -- the extra load on the
system is worth it, in my opinion.
At the very least. the write up in aids should make the
situation clear. Presently it doesn't.

It's a contradiction in terms to ask that an executable
command give a condense error. But it could give an
execution error. The problem with THAT is that present
usage (with variable - error-) would dictate that either
-error- gets set (and someone may choose not to check it),
or that an execution error is given. To give BOTH
possibilities would require a syntax something like:
leslist lesson,block,flag
where flag is a variable into which an error indication
is put; flag would be optional, and if not coded, an
excution error would be given. Thus, an author could
check for the problem, or leave it to the system, as he
chose.

One feature which would be very useful would be:

storage user='instructor',322,0

This would allow in a router for an instructor to initiate
dataset transfers without having students be tagged with an
unnecessary 322 words. While not a return to an executable
storage command, which I realize is unreasonable, this calls
for the evaluation of sustem variables at condense time.
This would save having to put nearly identical routines in
separate lessons, thus calling in extra ECS and a jumpout.

Are the values of system variables known at condense time?
Could they be? Maybe in the future the creation of a
special class of condense time variables could be done so
that certain parameters of the lesson could be altered
without creating separae copies. Admittedly, affecting
the amount of storage allocated is the only use I can see
at the moment.

---------- response 1
  12/09     10.37     wooley       p

Presumably at condense time you would want the value
of -user- to be set according to who was condensing.
Then anyone who came into the lesson later would either
get storage or not get storage depending on who
originally condensed it...
Does not seem very practical.

---------- response 2
  12/09     10.56     michael       english

NO! You would want user set for each person who enters,
as it is now. Thus storage is allocated FOR that user
dependent on HIS user type. Say the system variable
*usert* existed with values of:

        non-routed student          =-1
        student                     =0
        multiple                    =1
        author                      =2
        instructor                  =3

Then, at entry to lesson:

storage usert,0,25,0,25,322

Get its use now? Not exactly condense time variables,
but entry time variables.

---------- response 3
  12/09     12.57     becker       reading

That implies executable storage. However seeing as storage
is added to ecs for every person entering a lesson with
storage there is no reason (that I can see) not to make
it executable. The algorithm that decides if there is room
for you to enter an already condensed lesson could assume
the maximum storage tag (which would have to available at
condense time).

---------- response 4
  12/09     13.19     michael       english

It would NOT imply executable storage on the user level,
only at the system level, which I believe already exists.
I.e., not executable as the old storage command was.

         How about a new tag for the -erase- command:

         erase n

where n is a line number counting down from the top of the
screen. This would obviate the necessity of using an -at-
command to erase a given line of text.

Like:

It alredy exists, but a la¬e:
at    1010
erase 10

Effect obviously different. I like:

erase 1010;37,10

I.e., erase 37 wide, 10 down, starting at 1010.

The fact remains that you are still doing the *at*, but
it is implied in this case -- it seems like an interesting
shortcut, but I personally don't think it's all that nec-
essary. Other opinions?

When I encountered this problem I wrote a little subroutine
taking three arguments:

  unit  erases (v90,v91,v92)
  at    v90
  erase v91, v92

Thus, "do erases (1010,35,2)" would erase 35 chars for
two lines starting at 1010.

The l command dosen't do anything visable. That is why
you probably didn't think that it worked. What it does
is reset the max line displayed to what ever you tell it.
It is originally 8.
It is useful when searching through a lesson for a certain
unit when you don't know in what block it resides. Set
the line limit to 1 with L1 and then do your search starting
from block a. The "not found" will be displayed quicker
since you won't have to wait for 7 more lines to print.

reach 500 terminals. It likely that the number of lessons

   Roughly: with 2 million words of ecs we will be
able to afford a lesson buffer of around 1.5 million
words--this will be sufficient to guarantee 1500 words
to each and every one of the 1000 terminals that can
possibly be connected. This figure can almost certainly
be made larger (not all 1000 terminals are likely ever
to be on at the same time), but we intend to proceed with
caution--and only forward this time! Note that at present
the allocation on a per terminal basis is somewhere around
700 words,  so site ecs allocations will grow by around
a factor of 2 as soon as the new ecs is installed, tested,
and working reliably (only guesses are currently available
as to when that might be--but hopefully early in January).

just a minor correction-- with the installation of
terminals after ecs supplies were  'cut off ' many site
have MUCH LESS than 700 words per terminal... example
site 'med' has 32 terminals and guaranteed b K which
is about 562 words per terminal... sites which
were 'favired' in terminal deliveries also got a
better deal with respect to ecs per terminal in the

      I think that when a site director tells you he is
      going to bump you in order to gain more ecs for
      other users he ought to give you at least three
      to five minutes to straighten out what you are
      doing. On several occassions I have been informed
      that I was going to be removed and then after only
      about 30 seconds I get bumped off the screen. I
      think that it is important that people be at least
      allowed to get what they are working on in some sort
      of order so that when they come back to it they
      will not have lost their train of though.  Any

i think that when an author is working in a room that
has been reserved for classroom use he should be aware
that he is a low priority user.  when in fact he need not
be allowed to use the terminal at all, any use he is
granted should be appreciated.  it is uncomfortable to
be running classes and have to ask people to back out
so that the scheduled students can get around in their
assigned lessons...it would be much easier just to
course restrict the room for the entire class period...
but it has generally been our policy to allow general
usage of the terminals as long as the class is not
disturbed or hindered in their work.
in most cases 3-5 minutes is too long a time to help
the students move around freely... they too are on a
limited time schedule...

Personally I would be as opposed to giving an author any
grace period where my students were concerned as I would
be opposed to letting a bunch of outsiders use the seats for
5 minutes in a classroom where I was scheduled to teach a
regular class. However, I do think the site director
should have available software which would let him make and
enforce his own policy on author usage just as a router
lesson lets the course director make and enforce policy
on student usage.

it is policy of the site users committee on site 22
('med')  to allow three minutes for any legitimate user
when the space is needed for a higher priority activity.
if you were bumped quicker. maybe you were in a game--
in any case site 22 users are urged to contact the
medical computing laboratory and the site directors
if they have any complaints about site management--

    Personally, the only time this has seemed problem has
been when the director did not give me time to even make a
change in the condense flags for the lesson I was editing.
This has forced me to run around to different sites on
several occassions just to sign on long enough to get the
working part of the lesson available once more.

    When forced to leave before finishing writing a routine
that I have thought out. I have just learned to write notes
on  paper for later reference.  It is a nuisance sometimes,
but authors are low priority users (as was already pointed
out).

One of our lessons condensed faultily this morning.
A -chartst- apparently failed to work, and we
(repeatably) got a lesson with a random set of
characters. Recondensing the lesson without making any
changes in it cured the problem.

---------- response 1
  12/11     11.22     steve       cu

     Sometimes what can happen is that the charset id
is loaded but the charset is not. This will cause the
program to think it has the right charset. If you try
loading a different charset, and try your lesson again,
it usually works.
      However, if you didnt load any charsets between the
time it didnt work, and when it did, then something may
have been wrong with the condense, but I doubt it.

dear steve (and all you other frustrated non-systems people)

you say you'd like to be helpful! here's a few suggestions:

1)  read a note before you respond to it with your instant
    analysis; we said that the failure repeatedly happened
    and that a re-condense cured it. does that sound like a
    bad charset flag?

2)  don't proliferate mis-information. notice that they now
    seem to set the charset flag at the end of loading a
    charset; line errors might knock out part of the
    loading of a charset (despite system protection against
    that); but its not likely that the whole charset could
    be lost (so that we would report 'random characters')
    AND that the charset flag would be set. I can see a
    neophyte programmer reading your note and concluding
    that's why _his_ charset doesn't load.

  12/12     09.30     bob y       reading

yes, steve, i'm upset about responses like yours (and NOTES

you have succeeded in muddying the waters; we still do not
have a response to our primary point. it seems that there
was an error in the condensing of a lesson. hs a
systems person noted our example? do the systems people
accept that as a possibility?

...and now, steve, here's where you come in: could other
users corroborate our findings? could they add details
about what commands might have been zapped or what time
of the day such bad condenses might have happened?

Is there someway I could access a FORTRAM compiler? I would
like to write a program analysing data saved in common
but it seems about impossible in TUTOR because one can't
dimenion a two dimensional array. If anyone can tell
me how to access the FoRTRAM compiler I will mail them

---------- response 1
  12/11     13.19     judy       pso

I don't know about the FORTRAM compiler, but...

If you know ahead of time the dimensions of your array,
you can very easily -define- a two- (or more) dimensional
array:

define mine
       x(i,j)=v (10 (i-1) + j)  where j?1'2'''10
           and i ? until you run out of space

You can put segmented variables into arrays:
         segment, p=n1,6
         x(i,j)=p (10 (1-1) + j)
Note that segmented variables must be in integer format.

By scaling floating pt. quantities, you can hold them in

*
*define x (i,j) =nc (i-1) ?jdim+j)

against the ecs of the site from which the lesson is
condensed? If it is not, then the system would first have
to condense the lesson, then, if it didn't fit in the
available ecs. you would get the 'memeory allocation...'
message, but the system has already determined the lesson's
size. Unless the last condense length of the lesson is

Kovara's response is correct in that the system has no

think about *use* commands, friends! Only two or three
words difference is apparent until the *use* is encoutered
during the condense...

It would be nice to show how much condensed code the
lesson contained if one gets the " Allocation Exceeded"
display -- in order to determine how much to partial
out... you can find this out now by placing a bad or dummy
command in your lesson - you'll get condense error

(who has the upper line), and does not seem to work for
the "pager" (with the lower line).

I guess I receive more pages then I initiate, and so thought
it worked all the time. Odd.

use   usea,t1      $$ this would cause block a,b,c to be used

use   useb,s1      $$ blocks a and b would be used

Depending on the 'continuity', or lack of it, of blocks
with the same name seens a little risky - rearranging
(adding or removing) blocks might easilly change the
performance of another lesson.

Hmmm...this is a little different from my original proposal
-- I suggested that it pick ALL blocks by that name, in
sequential order... but this certainly would be useful.
Oh -robson, presumably you would have a little more control
over -use-d lessons...would there be THAT much hassle?

I have several suggestions for you.
1. Go extensively through lesson testor and
write down all the hardware faults with your
terminal.
2. Report them.
3. Take a look at your average cpu usage in your records.
If it's higher than 3 ms/s, you may be autobreaking in
whatever you're doing, thus having problems with accep-
timg the talk.

Our slide selector was spastic last week.... at least
part of the cause seemed to be a loose plug where the
power cord plugged into the wall. Check your connectors.

It is possible to "destroy" the standard arrow through
loading an arrow in a charset. I can conceive of somehow
getting a blank arrow loaded, thus no arrow would appear
on the screen. For that, back clear out to "welcome"
and sign in again.

---------- note 857 code words
  12/16     15.43     friedman       csa

I'd like to get some discussion going on the subject of
security codes for common, leslist, and dataset.?
Currently, of course, all three of these features share
one security code. But these are separate features,
having separate purposes, and sharing one code for all
three produces some really dangerous situations.?
For example, my router has a leslist; some of the routed
lessons need to refer to this leslist, so have to have
the code word filled in. Other lessons have their own
commons. Now, sometimes the same lesson has to have
access to the router's leslist, and has to contain an
unrelated common. This results in a proliferation of
the number of lessons having the security codeword of the
router's leslist, with increasing danger to the integrity
of the leslist. And it results in a number of unrelated
commons having to have the same security codeword.?
(continued--press LAB)

---------- response 1
  12/16     15.52     friedman       csa

The same problem holds for datasets.?
Now, I can envision at least two solutions to this problem:
a particular solution and a more general solution.
The particular solution would be simply to add two more
codewords to every lesson file: a leslist codeword, and
a dataset codeword. This would presumably be easy to
implement, assuming the words are available.?
The more general solution would be to have several
codewords (say, maybe, 4 or 5) of general use. Give them
names or numbers: say, maybe, a b c d e. Then commands
like common, leslist, dataset, jumpout, etc. would
specify, as the third tag, which codeword has to match.
If the third tag were missing, the default could be to
match the codeword used now (so old lessons would still
run).?
I think there's a real problem, of quite some urgency to
my project. I'd especially like to see SYSTEM responses
to these suggestions.

---------- response 2

the general use codewords sound good--perhaps one could
specify (on the file data page) what the codeword is
used for (rather than specify by letter)--an indicator
could be set similar to what we do when we add a new blok
¬+ call it either charset, source, etc-- a general codeword
could be tagged as common, jumpout, etc (_except_ for the
change code)               TomL

    When we take more space out of the directory block of a
lesson for system information, then a number of important
pieces of data can be added and there will also be room for
more code words. A change to allocate on the basis of 7
disk blocks instead of 14 is planned along with this--about
the only effect as fat as users are concerned would be that
21 (as well as the current 14 and 28) block lessons would be
available (as well as 7 block "minis" for testing or
whatever). I'd hope that this can be completely early
next year (like before the end of January).

    While we're on the subject of adding data page
information, one important addition would be storing not
only the authors name, but some sort of supervisor name as
well (if any). The problem is that many authors are transient
Contacting the person that actually wrote the lesson will
many times be impossible. Inspection of catalog indiacates
some groups solve this problem by giving the same author
name to all lessons, even if there are 300 of them. Add-
ing the extra info could more accurately reflect the
situation.

Rick, thank you for the system response. An implementation

In lesson accy3, the perpetual calendar is wrong for every
year before 1901.
Rule: every 4 years is a leap year, EXCEPT:
    every 100 years is _not_ a leap year, EXCEPT:
    every 400 years _is_ a leap year.
Thus 2000 is correct, and 1900 (and all before it) is not.

---------- response 1
  12/16     17.10     meers       wright

actually the 'Leap Year Rule' of Pope Gregory XIII is that
a day be dropped from every centesimal year (ending in 00)
whose number cannot be divided by 400.. Thus, a day was
dropped in the years 1700, 1800 and 1900. This meant that
the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years and had
only 28 days in February. A day will not be dropped in the
year 2000 so febrauary 29, 2000 will exist..

   11 days were dropped from our calendar in 1752 to make
it correct so September 2, 1752 was followed by September
14, 1752..

  Perpetual calendars made using the above rules are correct
at least back to October 15, 1582...

---------- note 894 introtutor
  12/17     12.22     steve       cu
     I would like to protest the recent restriction of
lesson "introtutor" to authors only. Here, we have a public
student type signon that is used by people to become
familiar with PLATO before they are given author records.
Many want to learn the TUTOR language, and therefore
"introtutor" was made available from the router.
     To my horror, I saw a student try to run introtutor
only to get the message that he must run it as an author.
Why was this unnecessary and useless restriction made?
It doesnt take up extra ECS, and is valuable learning
tool. Now, students must get what TUTOR they can from
the manuals and from "aids", not the best way to be
introduced to the language.
     I would appreciate comments on this subject, especially
from the person responsible for the restriction,

     Steven Lionel/Cornell University

---------- response 1
  12/17     12.30     orpheus       cu

        I'd like to add my voice to Steve's in protesting
this restriction. Like most of the others who have become
authors here, I learned the basics of TUTOR in "introtutor."
The lesson is well-written and very informative, and its
choice of introductory material is excellent--an extremely
important consideration, given the subtleties (and the
power) of the TUTOR language. I can say for myself that
AIDS, while an invaluable reference source for experienced
authors (I can't think of anyone who could do without it),
is almost completely incomprehendsible to the uninitiated.

        I think the restriction of "introtutor" was and
ill-considered move. but I'd be happy to change my mind
if the persons responsible can present a convincing argu-
ment.

without an author record.

And if I may add to Jim's remarks:
The designers of the introductory materials thought that
it would be especially beneficial to interesperse practice
with learning: after reading chapter 1 in the manual,
going through section 1 of "introtutor", and going through
sample lesson A, the learner will benefit greatly from
writing his version of sample lesson A right then.
To do this, an author record is necessary.

you are witholding a valuable piece of work from
those who have only student records because the work

perhaps looking through introtutor will encourage
some who are shy about programming to become more
interested and request quthor records...

I would also like to ask if the people who were using
"introtutor" in student mode had ever inquired of the
authors as to the use of the lesson? How was Jim to know
that you were finding a valuable use for a lesson in
student mode when he had written it and always thought
about it as a lesson to be used in actually training
new authors? Read Celia's comments to get the flavor of
what the intended use was. Is it true that all of the
burden of poor communication is Jim's? I don't think so.

I hope this little story now has a happy ending, however.

A funny thing...
If you type an ACCESS-SPACE, then do a TAB (in one of
the editors, say) the next thing you type is plotted a
half-space too far back. Thus, ACCESS-SPACE TAB * plots
as in line (1) below when you type it in at the arrow, and
as in line (2) below when you replot it on the display page.
Not only does this make it hard to line things up, but when
you press ERASE, it erases in the right place even though
you are plotted at the wrong place. This is frustrating
to no end...

Also along similar lines... We were told some time ago that
to ge system variables into define set -student- we should
use something like

define student
       ...
       sysvar=sysvar
       ...

but this generates a warning message....

you should say:

Also if a lesson only has "warnings" will the "binary" be

In light of the ecs/terminal crunch, I'd like to suggest
some variable, with a proposed name "ptime," which returns
a value of -1 if it is currently during a prime time
period, and 0 if the current time is during off-hours.
This would incorporate the day of the week also, so that
ptime would be -1 on Friday at 3pm, but 0 on Saturday
and Sunday at the same time.

Since quite a few lessons are concerned with whether
or not the execution is during prime time, this would
make things a lot simpler, and might encourage authors
to put in a prime-time check for their lesson, since
it would no longer be a long and messy routine, but
just a check on the variable "ptime."

I am afraid that almost any amount of ecs will be used

not soon become available, use the following (not optimal
code- but it should be easy to see what is happening)

day      v1 $$get julian day
calc     v2?int(7?frac(v1/7))+1 $$day of week; 1=monday

   I would still like to see some response on that idea of

used up. I think it is a good idea and will be used

I'd also like to see the variable implemented, or at

responses are on the question of sufficient ECS for next

as before, but that doesn't relp get new system values

     There are only so many system variables (as well as
commands) that can be supported without heavy changes to
the format of condensed TUTOR.
     The sysprogs are doing right to save these "slots" for
when they're really needed (tho I too am itching for
certain new system variables!)

One consideration is that prime time hours may change (as
they recently did), and many lessons are programmed once and
then left to fend for themselves. If we had a sysvar
"ptime", it would have the same virtue as the oft-recomˆ_
mended-in-aids practice of using "a" instead of 01 so that
your lesson logic will survive system (and in this case,
administrative) changes.

Latest word on ECS:
 
        Only half of the ECS we were expecting will be
shipped tomorrow! The other half has not passed inspection
at the factory and is now expected to arrive here on Jan. 6.

Nevertheless, we can and will complete nearly all of the
plumbing and electrical work necessary for the complete
one-million word installation in advance of actually getting
the ECS.

So, the schedule is as announced before: PLATO will be off
starting Monday morning (Dec. 23). PLATO will be back on
Jan. 2 or earlier. Sometime after Jan. 6, we will need
about a day to connect the last half-million words of ECS.

After that, we will test the new ECS during non-prime time
and put it into use as soon as it seems reliable.

Recording who was the last author to edit your leslist

he can edit your leslist using his own leslist editor

        The condensor can't handle block names with
punctuation in them when they appear in a -use- command.
        That is, a -use- with a comma in it is always
interpreted as -use lesson,block- REGARDLESS of any
other commas that might be present.
        Quotating the block name doesn't help; the quotes
are treated as part of it.
        Changing the block names won't work when the -use-d
blocks are in somebody else's lesson. I realize that there
might be some conceivable objection to using code with the
owner of which you're not on good enough terms to ask to
rename blocks; but that's what usecodes are for: besides,
the owner of such blocks can no more -use- them than can
Joe Snoop.
        A local modification to the condensor should be
quite simple, IF it seems desirable to someday remove this

For a person who has a lesson with an open use code, but

called anything but print sounds nice). What would it do?
Well! It would add a file named in the tag to the print

There would be a limit of 1 print per 24 hour period.

GREAT IDEA!!!

      Here's another situation where an executable
"PRINT" command would be super-useful:
      I have a program which uses a LARGE dataset; I keep
a little directory for it out in a common. Each block in
the dataset can contain information that goes with various
other blocks in the dataset---the directory tells me which
blocks belong together(and in which order).
      At certain times I want to print out just the
info about a certain topic(ie, contained in a set of
different blocks); I can tell which block ¬$s and their
order by looking at my directory. It would be very useful
to be able to just request a print of those block ¬$s by
having a PRINT command that takes some parameters.....

System errors that occur when Plato is coming up are
very common and should not be reported.....

Report only errors that occur while Plato is up.

     But Russ, that gift isn't even approved, and wouldn't
be installed until the summer, at the earliest. Sigh.
     However, it is nice to know they're coming. Hope
your holiday surprises are as nice as ours.

Strange results........

I requested a print of my lesson at about 3:100 yesterday.
(Fri. 20) The print I recieved was done on wed. eve at
9:45. _BUT_, the status report said it had been done 2 sec.
after midnite wed. eve. (just into thurs. morn)
HOWEVER, when I checked with the operator, no request had
was found except for the one I had put in wed. eve.
AND Again, my partner requested a print of his lesson, and
according to the operator's data it had been acknowledged
and done. BUT, his print wasn't in any of the boxes.

     Inference - Something be wrong with the print system.

       Anyone else get anything strange like this 

                    Systems people ?

  The reason that your print was marked done around midnite
when it was actually printed at 9:45 is because prints
are not marked done when they finish printing. That is done
by the operator by hand, sometimes long after the lesson has
been printed, if it is a busy night.
  
   As to your friend losing his print, we get back to the
old catchalls of operator error, or a misleading heading.

   I wish I could give firm answers to the questions about
the prints being lost, but I can't. All I can say is that
I think we have been giving better service since we moved
into 165.

---------- note 76 fiche bait
  12/21     20.13     hody       med

we often need to show microfiche apart from the lesson
with which it is designed to be used. in such cases, we
want to be able to select a frame to view, advance,
go back, select another frame, and often, superimpose
some test computer graphics to see over which areas
of the slide they will show up properly. this can be
done with lessons 'aids', 'testor', and 'slides' but
unfortunately, none of these had the right "feel"...

those who agree are invited to try option 3 in lesson
'intergraf' for a microfiche frame selector that
may be useful...
comments and suggestions are invited in personal notes.

There's another microfiche sequencer in lesson "help,.
It is gotten in the author aids section by pressing TERM
on the first page, when the message appears which says
"Press TERM for author and test aids".
Since lesson "help" is pretty frequently condensed by
students, this section should be of help to you. It allows
you to display slides in timed sequence.

The ID option of the editor also shows microfiche and
has the added advantage over the lessons mentioned that it
allows the "author" to position text, graphics, etc
on the projected image. This is a very usefull feature.

---------- response 3
  12/22     10.48     hody       med
 
i think the slide showing routine in 'help' is rather
new and unadvertised... it is indeed handy and so is
the routine for designing graphics over slides in the
'ID' option... I understand that 'slides' is intended
only for chemistry authors and not for general use...
*
i think there is still a need for a routine which
allows easy access to all slides on a fiche, sample
graphics overlays, and all with a minimum of key presses...
hopefully, something like this or better will someday
be incorporated into the editor (combined features)...

an aside: we have noted wide variation in the sharpness
which can be gotten from specific slide projectors--even
after servicing, alignment, cleaning, etc... the best
are very good- the worst atrocious... has this been
a common finding? and what can one do to bring the
bad units up to the level of the better ones?

Some projection lenses in the microfiche projectors seem
to be considerably better than others. I agree that
some image selectors are really very sharp while others
limit the resolution of the microfiche system.
The problem is in the lenses and can't be corrected by
adjustment of the unit.

Several months ago I did mention this problem to Dr.
Bitzer and Dr. Prcpst.

We have felt the same need for a slide projector
that is simple to get to and simple to use.

Feel free to use the one (option 1) in chalibary, though
it hardly fulfills all those qualifications, it does
allow you to set a timer.

Should not the printout option display accessed via "P"
"p" be titled "PRINTOUT REQUESTS, instead of "REQUESTS"?

Well, there IS a section for "other requests", which does
not do anything except tell one how to get other requests
handled. Of course, this is probably only there because
actually asking for new lessons, etc., was once a part
of the old "request" feature.

---------- response 2
  12/22     22.09     silver       ve

Right... and now "r" stands for "return". It is simply
easier to remember a set of arbitrary initials if the
displays one sees reinforce what one remembers. Thus...
File request is dead! Long live "printouts" and "return"!

I wish to file a small complaint. Sunday, 12/23/74,
I wanted to engage the chess3p5 lesson for a
battle royale. However, the ECS deletion message
came on, Absently, I took a look in rash and
much to my surprise only

across?

same gripe here -
I tried chess3p5 on Jan 1, on a virtually empty machine.
Is the ECS Dave Andersen refers to other than the lesson
buffer????? Why not check the muse and mallot variables
before giving a message which says ECS is tight?

 I would also like to complain that other lesson should
have a lower priority than 3p5. I think that 3p5 is a better
learning tool than many of the other lesson that I see in
constant use and I for one would like to see 3p5 used before
others

While PLATO was off, several major improvements were made
in our support facilities: 1) A backup system for our com-
putor room air conditioning was installed; 2) A backup for
the water chilling apparatus was installed; 3) We increased
our electrical supply for the computor to more than account
for the increased demand from the new ECS.

Also, all the cables to connect the new ECS were installed
in the ECS controller, and an eighth disk drive was
installed.

But, the new ECS did NOT arrive! It is now scheduled for
shipment on January 3, which means we expect it here in
Urbana on Monday morning, January 6.

---------- note 90 ecs cont.
  12/31     10.56     golden       s

Assuming that schedule, We will spend all day Monday moving
in the equipment and connecting the power and water.
(PLATO can probably stay on during this work.) Then,
PLATO will have to go off again on Tuesday, January 7 so the
ECS can be connected and tested. We expect to be back on
sometime late Wednesday, January 8.

We are very sorry for this added inconvenience.
